### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. 

The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. 

In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast & Furious movie to date. 

I want to go see it again!

(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or might even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).

Well, color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed, it's always been big, loud, and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release, appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However, it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around, the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So, it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.

Fast Five ditches the street racing that made it's name in favor for being a heist film. In this particular case, we pick up right from where we left off, with Dom being busted out of his prison bus. They then flee to Rio where they take on a heist that goes haywire and eventually leads to the penultimate heist of the film. In the meantime, ruthless Agent Hobbs, who specializes in tracking and capturing people, arrives to catch out trio of outlaws. The film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action. And in the action department, the film delivers tenfold. Far bigger, louder, and more exciting than any F&F film before it, action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosterone-laced mix of car and foot action.

Now, don't get me wrong, this is still a F&F film. This means that the script is still pretty laughable and the acting leaves much to be desired. However, with that said, it's still a bit improved here. Vin Diesel still can't play up emotion very well, making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable. Paul Walker doesn't fair much better and, unfortunately, even as a main character takes a back seat to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. As action stars though, these three do a great job. In particular, the eventual confrontation between Diesel and Johnson is fantastic, with it being a brutal, WWE-esque rumble. The climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission. Though laughable, it's still an exciting, eye-popping scene that will leave you a little stupefied. 

Certainly, you have to suspend much of your disbelief with your film. If you can't do that, you'll just find this entire film laughable and of poor entertainment value. For those who can though, this is a very entertaining film. And for fans, you'll certainly enjoy the film, with a well rounded cast from throughout the entire series coming together to pull off the impossible. It's definitely surprising to see that the fifth film in the series is the best, but I suppose that it's merely the evolution of F&F. With enough money, talent, and by pulling out all the stops, the franchise has finally capitalized on the over-the-top aspects that they had always seemed to go for. Suffice to say, action fans with enough suspension of disbelief will enjoy this immensely.

I've been a personal fan of the F&F series ever since the very first title was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I immediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was successful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise, fast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action scenes.

Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer, this movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on this title.

Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the bad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift. 

This is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year, see it, or be left behind.

After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that "Fast 5" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However I am pleased to say the series has redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out all the stops this time around. It delivers on action, cars, quality acting and a decent storyline. It explores the character personalities showing more humor, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie strength and depth that was missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. 

I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the subtle humor, and leaning forward for the action scenes which are truly amazing.

The Story is not predictable and will keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has matured and it shows in the quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies.

Pros:

Good pace throughout the movie

Decent storyline and plot

Good Cast of actors/ actresses

Imaginative and inventive elements throughout

Plenty of "Wow" moments

Cons: 

Would be nice to have more screen time for the cars

a couple of cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humor of the film)

Overall: Highly recommended film, Just be sure to stay until the end of the credits!

The weather is finally better, people are taking their clothes off all over the place and even though it is still spring time, summer movies are now officially kicking off and ladies and gentleman, we start this summer right with Fast Five. The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste, a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie, like intellectual dialogue, solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No, what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn, no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand, I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin (who also directed the fast and the furious) makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION, and you know..In an action moviethat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So , umback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action, I seriously have not seen this kind of solid , non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Ohso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious, the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films, filled with cheesy cliché's that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great, it's these roles he should be taking, not the flying fairy kind, he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his, this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything, and he really does know everything. Frankly, that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film, that's all you need. So this one is easy folks, for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them, you should know better, you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action , seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars , beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.

As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.

Rio De Janeiro provides the backdrop in which this installment takes place in (quite a popular location for films recently too), with the chief villain being Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), a mobster with a businessman front, with his tentacles of vice and influence extending toward every part of the city. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the former's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious, and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant, they decide to assemble a team, not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.

So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films, such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and even Han (Sung Kang) whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift, hence putting the chronology of the films at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3, which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment, keeping with the usual action laden elements, while bringing on new characters into the franchise, this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense, dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs, with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.

And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs, especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry, while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films, it's make or break given the character's appeal, and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their know-how to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity, and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.

And if it's action you're seeking, it's action you'll get in this film too, putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off, although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman, Dom, Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer, with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed, in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything, and I mean everything, along their path, that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. 

Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise, and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads, since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters, and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other, this of course would be recommended fare. 

Stay tuned while the end credits roll, and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film, with no less than two surprise appearances. But no, with the timeline, it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys. For an adrenalin pumping high octane entertaining film outing, Fast Five is that opener to a very noisy and crowded summer season to come.

A Nutshell Review: Fast Five

Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite  all the fans of the previous film(s) and then disappoint them with a  production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a  remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse   this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this  fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors, read on to see why. 
Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off, with Dominic  sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the  end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was  that they managed to break Dom out of custody, dodged every authority,  and have fled to Rio de Janeiro (where every Brazilian seems to be  portrayed as a gun-toting thug). In order to break free, they attempt  to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all  become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips  through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs  (Dwayne Johnson), who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord  Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who wants them dead. 
That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances  guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations  and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he  was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE  side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But  Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of  filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular  action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of  The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a  'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than  racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing, and for the  record there's even an ex-wrestler versus action hero fight like there  was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone. 
The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the  audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in  process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the  audience knows who, what, when, how and why the team are in Brazil. The  second act revolves around the main plot element of the $100 million  heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew  plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand  would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours, longer than all of the  previous films. The 10 minutes after a full two hours weren't really  necessary but show us the aftermath of the third act, the hugely  thrilling act. Any who feel frustrated at the pace of the second act   stay for the climactic scene in the third act. 
Think of Fast Five as the cinematic equivalent of a mindless muscular  athlete. Can't talk a good game but can surely play a good game. We  have all met that person, that guy who failed his exams but took the  football pitch by storm at high school. Fast Five is as absent minded   plain characters and clunky dialogue. But the 'physical' side is where  it amazes  the action scenes of course. It's like the men behind the  camera decided to perfect the action scenes, the plot was secondary.  Looking at this year's earlier films The Mechanic and The Green Hornet,  it's safe to say that Fast Five has the best action sequences of the  year yet, and is the best action film overall so far. 
Verdict: Forgive the simplicity of the script and get ready for the  fastest and most furious ride yet.

This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.

Without a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches it's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of friendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.

In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it

I had quite high expectations about this movie. And they paid of even more that I thought.

I thought that getting all awesome guys from previous movies was great idea. Like Han from "Tokyo Drift" alone made this movie much, much better for me just with his appearance. I also very enjoyed Roman's appearance as I really liked him in "2 Fast 2 Furious" (much peoples say it's lame, but I think it was a great entertainment)and he was pretty cool in here too, tough a lil bit too negative. I didn't really remember Gisele and these two Dominicans Tego and Rico. But I guess, they were from "Fast & Furious". I have seen it only once, so I don't really remember any second plan characters. These guys however were great too. I loved these two Dominicans arguing. Now finally about the movie. Well I loved it from first minutes till last seconds. It was full of tense action. Much more than in previous parts. What I didn't like was, that there were no street races in this one. I guess that bit where Han, Dom, Brian and Rom were racing betting 1 million each, can't actually be counted. I also didn't like Vince's appearance. I disliked him at first movie and don't think he was necessary at this one. Dwayne's Johnson's appearance was great too, because I very like some of his movies (Scorpion king, Welcome to the jungle). 

The plot. I liked it. It weren't too advanced and some people might call it unrealistic and lame, but, come on, it's an action movie! 

In summary I can say, this movie was one of greatest F&F franchise movies, if not the greatest. I hope to see whole gang together also for the next, because mostly that made this movie so awesome. 9/10

Like a fine wine, "The Fast and the Furious" franchise just gets better and in "Fast Five" my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was high-flying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was, and then I was starting to give up hope once "Tokyo Drift" was released, yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when "Fast and the Furious" was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise, but "Fast Five" exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean "Lethal Weapon" has had very good sequels in its heyday and "The Terminator" not to mention "Rocky" as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time; it's like an underdog in its own right.

The story on "Fast Five" is well above average. It's like a continuation from where we left off from the previous installment. The story involves Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the gang conjures up a way to escape the seemingly endless array of escaping from the law and family issues. There's another subplot that centers on a drug kingpin and a missing computer chip. If you have a DVR you could fast forward those scenes because they're really not worth mentioning. Which is all good, but the main purpose to see this movie isn't due to the brilliant performances or a scintillating script. The hell with that! You're here for the exhibition of colorful, high-energized cars, the endless nonstop action and the attractive ladies. That's why you come to see this kind of movie.

As I mentioned before "Fast Five" won't win any Oscars or Golden Globes, but you know what? Who really give a damn? The performers like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster and Sang Kang are all out to have a great time. And the chemistry within the characters is quite mesmerizing.

Of course it's all about the action in movies like these, which will leave you breathless. Such memorable scenes include the one where gangs confiscate cars from a moving train. Who in their right minds would do something so stupid and dangerous? Another is an awesome foot chase in the condemned slums of Brazil (the scenery is postcard perfect). It's where The Rock and The Vin embark in a battle that was one of the rare moments that was not dependent on CGI. Let's not forget about the climax but I won't give any spoilers away. Also be sure to stay around for the end credits to know what the next installment will be about.

Overall "Fast Five" offers exhilarating action, backed up with scintillating visuals, with a compelling story to keep you on edge and great acting for those who love action flicks.

Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.

However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.

The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong. 

Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. 

Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. 

Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.

Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.

What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.

There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.

With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.

I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10

Having heard (when the trailer was first released) that this was going to be the last in the "Fast and Furious" franchise I went in expecting to see all the lose ends tide up but instead I found more were made than were tide. It's a great movie and I love all the characters (each one has a great story and depth behind them) but the fact that in the fourth one Letty is meant to have died whilst trying to get the man she loves - Dom - back into the US and is shown in a photo and believed to be alive in Berlin without telling her beloved where she is, is slightly confusing. Also at the start of the fourth it is meant to show what happened to Han before he wound up in Tokyo Drift (where he met his doom (weep)) and he as well as the audience seemed pretty convinced that he was heading straight there, but he somehow finds his way into Fast and Furious 5 because he hasn't quite made it to Tokyo yet - to confusing for my liking although I couldn't stop smiling when the whole gang is brought together - great idea and fabulous surprises - I can't wait the sixth one (confused that there is a sixth one though)!!!

Honestly, this is the third "Fast and the Furious" movie I have seen but by far was this the best one! With an amalgamation of genres, this movie would possibly appeal to all types of viewers except those who love ROM-COMs! I loved how everyone came together to do the job; the same people I loved in the movies which I saw together made my day as there was so much to relate to! Not much racing as the others, but what is there truly keeps you glued to your seat. Screenplay was interesting, locations eye-catching and casting, already stated! It's one of those movies which you like a lot while watching it and then later think about what happened within it at random times. Yes, you may not want to give it a second view immediately or even soon after, but you just may replay those highlighted scenes, for example, when Vin Diesel and "The Rock" face off. That fight was intense and boy, was it gripping!

Overall, an enjoyable movie but the 9-10 band cannot include this movie. Why? You'll agree with your own reasons after you watch it. Simply a great movie, but great to that extent, not really.

This movie has every possible element a great action movie should have! Cars, hot girls, a decent plot, loads of action and an explosive ending that marks the beginning of another sequel. The person that thought of confronting Vin Diesel and The Rock is a mastermind, and just for the brilliance of the idea should be awarded with an Oscar. The testosterone level was, at points, so high that I was literally shouting and cheering at the TV set. Emotions are also well incorporated so the movie has depth. The characters are, even though there is a whole bunch of them (the entire FF crew from every movie in the franchise), well described, complex, and interesting. I was a little afraid that there would be too much of them at once, but boy was I wrong! Every character has it's own story told from the beginning 'till the end. The music was nicely picked but, in my opinion, there could have been a little more metal or rock (Sepultura would have been a good choice since the movie is made in Brasil). The thing that shook me entirely was the ending. The photo that Eva presents to The Rock is so shocking that I couldn't have believed my eyes! And I must say, not many movies in the last few years managed to create that sort of feeling in me. There is only one problem with the movie: it ends. Get your crew, grab as much popcorn and sodas as you can and have a blast.

Fast five was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time and it got 7.6/10 on IMDb and grossed $86 million in the first weekend i don't know who you are but i'd rather watch a fast and furious movie than your stupid British movies any day. and let me say something about what you said was wrong with this movie.

1. you were complaining about how Hobbs started helping Brian and Dom, he started helping them because they saved his life from people who were trying to kill him and Dom and Brian weren't. 

2. you were saying ". The team..........totally being ripped from Oceans 11 and Gone in 60 seconds films" none of the actors were in either of those movies.

3. you were saying " Brazilian police instead of Fords have supped up NOS guzzling super cars as basic patrol vehicles)" last i checked a dodge charger isn't a super car. and I've seen cops with chargers were i live.

4. you were saying " For a team of people who wanted to just disappear, they managed to annihilate a whole squadron of police cars, assault Brazil's maximum security police station, destroy half of Rio, Kill about 40+ police officers and then for their retirement, buying the rarest cars in the world ( always the best way to lie low for a while" when you have $100 million you don't have to lay low. 

don't forget its a movie its not saying you can do this stuff in real life. and it is entertaining to see this kind of stuff because you cant do this stuff in real life.

Yesterday night, watching Fast Five at the cinema, I was surprised to see a standing ovation at the end of the movie as well as loads of clapping during the movie for a series of scenes - this is the first movie that I've witnessed such thing.

People that paid for the ticket had high expectations and it was worth it. There was a bit for everyone: good comedy, nice cars, very dynamic and full of action, thrill and last but not least very good acting from Vin, Dwayne and the others.

All in all it was well worth the money, it was obviously the best from its franchise and I am really looking forward to the F&F 6.

Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.

Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! 

"Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!" 

I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.

When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.

Fast Five (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 5 or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist is a 2011 American action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan.It is the fifth installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. It was released first in Australia on April 20, 2011, and then in the United States on April 29, 2011. Fast Five follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) as they plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).

10/10 Score: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures, Original Film Starring: Vin Diesel,Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar Director: Justin Lin Producers: Neal H.

After Fast and Furious was released in 2009, it was announced that Universal Studios would release a fifth film titled Fast Five in 2011, but this time the films would depart from the underground street-racing theme of the previous films and transforms the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider with car culture and cars being used as a heavy emphasis.

The plot follows the events of the last film with Dominic being transported to Lompoc Prison, but eventually is saved by Brian O'Conner and his sister, Mia Toretto as they hid in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They plan a heist to steal $100 million dollars from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued by arrest US Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs.

To me, this was the film that transformed this franchise from the underground racing-theme in the previous film to movies that has cars and girls and stuff. This was also the first film that features only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100 million.

The action is top-notch with the climactic car chase at the end of the film, which is the best climax in an action / comedy film ever made and created and I give credit to the director and the script writer for doing this.

The music by Brian Tyler is just memorable and I'm not going to go into too much detail about his musical score for this film because he's also composed music for the fourth and fifth films in the Final Destination series and he has just finished composing music for the upcoming sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron, which hits theaters worldwide next Friday on May 1st, 2015.

Now, I get to the acting. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto and he is really good. The same can definitely be said for Paul Walker & Jordana Brewster as Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto. Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh & Gisele Yashar were wonderfully, especially Gal Gadot, who will be playing Wonder Woman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is set for release in March of next year.

The film sees the return of Matt Schulze as Vince and he does a great job in the screen time that he has until he dies in the film, which is a sad moment. The film would also see the return of Chris "Ludacris" Bridges as Tej Parker and Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce and they do a very great job and the comedy is just funny and the way they talk is just funny and amazing.

The film introduces three new characters: Hernan Reyes, the main villain, played by Joaquim de Almeida, who does a very good job, but it took me a couple of re-watches to understand what the heck was saying. The second character introduce is Elena Neves, Hobbs' partner and Dominic's second love interest, played by Chris Hemsworth's wife, Elsa Pataky. She is just cool. Finally, the third character who would be introduced was Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and he performs the role fantastically. The fight between Dominic and Hobbs was fantastic and Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson took that scene really seriously.

Overall, I simply love Fast Five. It blends action with comedy so brilliantly and awesome. The drama also works and it is really great. I give it a 9 out of 10, this might be a little bit high, but it definitely works for me.

While I love "Fast and Furious" franchise, I kinda don't like how they title some installments, such as "Fast and Furious" in 2009 (actually a fourth film) and now this. They drop "furious" in the fifth film and I don't know why. I guess it's for creative pursuit, but the adjectives "fast" and "furious" accurately describe the films' premise and atmosphere. Anyway, if you enjoy the previous four films, you'll definitely enjoy this for the fifth time. 

Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) work together with their friends to disarm a powerful Brazilian drug lord through a 100 million dollar heist. Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) joins this movie, so prepare for greater battle.

This is a major shift in the franchise, as they incorporate the heist sub-genre. So there are less racing, but the car chases are still there. I love how they plan their moves to get the vault. The police wants Dom and Brian, so the duo obviously has to run away inside the fast cars! The vault-dragging scene, which is apparently boasted in the trailer, is very fun and high-octane to watch. How the hell did they shoot that in a city? Editing is very good, the music is very pumping for the car sequences, and stunts are crazier than ever. A surprise character enters the storyline, so watch out.

This movie reminds me of "Resident Evil: Retribution" in terms of action and racial diversity, and it's interesting to note that this film and that film are fifth entries of their own franchises. Like how I love "Resident Evil" movies, I love the "Fast and Furious" movies!

Yeah, exactly... They've found the key to the success, I guess. I am so appreciated myself for being patient watching the first movies of the franchise. I was welcomed by a gorgeous work as I've hoped since watching Fast & Furious (2009) #4. I advise those who consider starting the franchise to be patient watching the first three nightmares (not recommended to skip them because there are some connection to be needed afterwards). It's good to focus on theme of the armed action-thriller also including fight rather than racing-based events. It is also one of the movies at which I laugh much. On the other hand, some scene of it is seriously touching. Action, thriller, comedy, dram, doesn't matter what you're interested in. This installment has all.

Featuring some of the most spectacular and jaw dropping action scenes I've ever seen in a film, this is the definition of action. This is how all the Fast and Furious movies should've been. It was after the first film that the series went downhill, with a poor second movie, an even worse third attempt, but the fourth was good enough setting the bar high enough, although director Justin Lin completely smashes that bar leaving it in the dust. He has totally breathed new life and full on excitement into the franchise. 

The main issue with the previous movies was the lack of breathtaking action, instead the creators settled on boring characters, corny emotional dialogue and not enough chaos, whereas this fifth movie just excels in everything, both in speed, drama and action. Stunning locations, gorgeous girls, earth-shattering fight sequences and a riveting story that completely knocks the first four films out the water, prepare for the ride of your life with Fast Five. The opening continues where the fourth film finished, and straight after comes the epic train sequence, then a rooftop chase across the maze of shanty town Rio, and thank god Diesel and The Rock fight it out. 

There are so many memorable scenes and awesome races that you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to trying to pick out your best moment. But, it has to be said, the finale is the one, which is fifteen minutes of action movie perfection with an exciting twist you definitely won't see coming. Must see! Must own! Fast Five is easily the highlight of 2011 for action.

In the first sequence of Fast Five, Brian, (the late great Paul Walker), Mia (jordana Brewster) and a third unknown driver attempt to rescue Dom, who was arrested at the end of Fast and Furious, from a prison bus. To make an cool action set piece short, Brian and Mia flip the damn bus over and get Dom out of it (somehow). I remember when I saw this action sequence for the first time, I realised the absurd hilarity of it all and so I whispered to my closest friend, "we should try that some time." My whole group proceeded to laugh at my remark, and then we shared quite a few laughs throughout the rest of the movie. Now, thinking back on that bus flipping moment, I begin to realise that Fast Five might have been that one movie that made me really appreciate fun, mindless action movies.

After Brian and Mia manage to get Dom out of police custody, the trio meets up in Rio where they're joined by Vince (Schulze) from the original Fast and the Furious. Vince tells them that they need to steal some cars from a moving train and you bet your ass it's as awesome as it sounds. After a glorious action sequence on board a train, Fast Five introduces Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who plays my second favourite character of the franchise here), a Diplomatic Security Service agent who wants to hunt Dom and his crew down and bring them all into custody. Meanwhile, Dom and his team (who I'll call "Dom's Ten") create a plan to steal $100 million from a crazy Brazilian guy named Reyes in a much cooler style than Danny Ocean's master plan of stealing millions of dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.

Fast Five has, undoubtedly, a story that drives very far away from those original racing roots that the series was known for back in the day. But this is what I ultimately dig about this series: its ability to evolve with each new sequel. There's something oddly glorious about a franchise that used to be about bros and hungry people racing cars transforming into a franchise about those same people attempting to steal $100 million dollars from a vault by dragging the vault out of a building and through the streets of Rio, putting hundreds of people in harm's way.

Now that is what I call entertainment!

A great addition to Fast Five is Dwayne the Rock Johnson who is one of the most charismatic people on the entire planet. Seriously, you could give that guy a horrible script and he would turn it into gold. With Fast Five, he is given gold and turns it into a damn diamond; the guy is magic. He's one of the few examples (Dave Bautista being a new example) of a wrestler- turned-actor that has actually succeeded as an actor in the long run. With his most recent appearance at WrestleMania 31,Johnson is a figure that can both be a welcomed addition to a movie and then can be welcomed back into the squared circle the very next day. In Fast Five, the Rock steals the show whenever he shows up because he's such a great screen presence. It's almost possible to feel him in the background of each scene (that he's not in), working his way to finding and taking down Dom's Ten.He also gets an awesome fight scene with Vin which is the best fight scene in the franchised only matched by Vin and Jason statham's fight scene in furious 7. Without the Dwayne, I don't think Fast Five would have reached the astronomical heights that it managed to cross.

Fast Five bounces around from action scene to action scene and in between these action scenes is where it fuses its great characters into its fairly entertaining story to deliver what I think is one of the most well-rounded packages of the entire franchise; it might even be the most well-rounded (at least so far). I mean, seriously, you got Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie; it's the Expendables of race car action movies. Fast Five also throws in a small bit of genuine emotion in one particular scene and it reminded me that this bonkers franchise is able to actually be sad from time to time. Who would've thunk it?

The one thing that has always managed to stick around in my brain since seeing Fast Five for the first time, and what has become my group's tradition since then, is picking characters from the movie that we "represent". I, of course, picked Dom because I'm the leader of our group. My closest friend picked Brian, my other friend picked Han because he's cooler than the rest of us, and so on and so forth. Since the Fast and the Furious series has always been about family/friendship, I believe that us choosing the characters like we did gave us a stronger connection to the movie but also a stronger connection to each other; this was the movie that evolved the friendship of my group into a small family that ultimately changed us all forever.

There's nothing stronger than the bond of family, and Fast Five really embraces that concept until it runs out of fuel and plummets off a cliff and into the waters below. It is also a life-changing movie and a damn fine example of how to mix action, characters, and emotion into one rollicking good package.
