### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
As a fan of the 2008 Swedish film "Let The Right One In", I was originally very frustrated when I heard the news about the upcoming remake. "How do you ameliorate something that is already perfect?", I asked myself. I treated the remake with hostility and vowed to stay away from it. And then, I decided to open my mind. 

I attended the world premiere of this film at the Toronto International Film Festival on Monday, September 13. I am very lucky to live in the proximity. This was the first year that I've attended the festival. Before seeing "Let Me In", I saw "127 Hours". 

I liked the idea of seeing the remake of a film that I recently gave a second viewing. I thought it would be a fun challenge to sit there and compare both films while watching. 

Before the screening (or it might have been after), the director, Matt Reeves (who launched his career with "Cloverfield"), was welcomed on stage to say a few words. It surprised me to find out that he, too, thought the original was fantastic and didn't understand why he was asked to remake it. However, after reading the book as well, he had the desire to work on his interpretation of it. After this speech, I gained a significant amount of respect for this man. 

When the movie began, I was only expecting something satisfactory. But as the story progressed, I was breathless. It was a very captivating, interesting take, and I loved all the little modifications. I honestly believe that "Let Me In" is one of the greatest American remakes of all time. 

Nevertheless, I still see the original, "Let The Right One In", as a superior film. Although it may be a biased opinion, I preferred the mood, atmosphere, and cinematography in the original. While the remake seemed to take a greater interest in the horrific violence, the original had the perfect blend of genres (thriller, romance, horror, fantasy). Both films had many beautiful contrasts: coldness vs warmth, chaos vs peace, guilt vs innocence, darkness vs delicacy, and despair vs hope. 

I must also mention that I preferred the sense of ambiguity presented in the original. Very few questions were answered, and the whole film was more of a mystery left to interpretation. In contrast, Matt Reeves was more clear and direct in his screenplay with the mystery surrounding his characters. It's all a matter of personal preference, though. I believe that most people will prefer what Matt did, since the original has a certain style that less people can appreciate. 

Despite the comparison, I believe that they are both great movies that can be enjoyed by everyone. Fans of the original-- rather than being narrow-minded and boycotting this version-- should give it a chance and appreciate it for what it is. Wouldn't you want more people in North America to discover this mesmerizing vampire tale, anyway? 

I really enjoyed every aspect of "Let Me In". The child actors, Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road) were both excellent choices. They proved to us, once again, that they are among the only child actors who actually have talent. Now that I think of it, the only thing that didn't impress me was the music. For an original score composed by Michael Giacchino (Up), I was quite disappointed. It was mediocre, in my opinion. It didn't convey the same emotion as Johan Soderqvist's music in "Let The Right One In". 

Aside from that, "Let Me In" is a surprisingly great film for the fans of the original. And it would probably be a bloody masterpiece for those who haven't seen it. And yes, that lame vampire pun was definitely intended.

Given the background to this film, I must start by saying I have neither read the book it is based on, nor seen the 2008 Swedish original. After watching this masterpiece, I intend to do both.

This is a truly sensational film. When you can't really pin a film down to a specific genre, you know you're onto something special. Calling this film a "vampire movie" doesn't really do it justice, given the preconceived notions most film goers bring to the genre. It is part horror, part dark family drama, part love story, with all 3 categories succeeding admirably.

In my estimation, the director has come on in leaps and bounds since "Cloverfield", a movie with a clever idea that was hampered by a poor cast and so-so execution. Here the director sets a mood of oppression and isolation from the very earliest frames and never lets up. The locations are used superbly, as are lighting and sound to create the gloomy world poor Owen is stranded in.

The film undeniably belongs to Chloe Grace Moretz as the young vampire Abby. This girl is an absolute powerhouse of an actress, turning in a dark, subtle and convincing performance that belies her tender age of 12. If she does not make the shortlist for next year's Oscars, the Academy needs its collective head examined. She embodies the potent mixture of lovable innocence and animalistic darkness within Abby with such ease, you will be genuinely astounded.

My fellow Aussie, Kodi Smit-McPhee, is also excellent, making you really feel for the put-upon Owen and share in his joy at finding a spark of happiness with the mysterious Abby. The entire film falls apart if this pair fail to convince, so it is a testimony to their respective talents (particularly Moretz') that you invest so heavily in their relationship.

Don't let the press about this film being a remake put you off. I must say I'm very disappointed to see this hasn't done too well at the box office in the USA, as it is a vastly superior film to the likes of "Paranormal Activity 2".

If anyone is in two minds about seeing this film, take the gamble and shell out your hard-earned. You'll be glad you did, if for no other reason than witnessing one of the most impressive performances by a child actor in cinema history.

Stop right there if you think this is a horror film. This film dances around a horror atmosphere while hiding in the shadows of a thriller. It's actually first and foremost, a romance.

Chloe Moretz, of Hit-Girl fame from Kick-Ass, plays a child vampire who moves in next door to a boy named Owen, who is very much alone and bullied at school. Owen's mother is an alcoholic who won sole custody and Owen's father is not allowed to come around. Moretz once again steals the show as the tragic character of Abby.

Let Me In is an adaptation, written and directed by Matt Reeves, of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. Barely anything has been changed from the original story, but the cinematography, some dialogue, different actors and adjusted characters make for a new movie. Although many fans of the original boycotted this film for months, Let Me In will allow for the original to be viewed.

Matt Reeves does an excellent job and I've enjoyed his first two films I've seen. Let Me In and Cloverfield are his only two pieces of work I've seen and they are his most popular thus far.

This is a romance because it plays very intimately between the two lead actors. The scenes between Owen and Abby are tender and very romantic for the age of the characters. It's surprising to see how well two child actors can be this mature and loving with such a great chemistry. It has some thrills and chills and there's room for drama but it's definitely meant to be a romance.

Personally, I've not seen the original film, but I do think this is a great film in its own right. It certainly did a good job to get me interested in watching the original whenever I get a chance.

It has a very short list of cast, as the only other names I can recognize are Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas. Their involvement is less than secondary characters and even then they are still overshadowed by the breathtaking Moretz. At 13 years of age, Moretz amounts maturity and skill in her acting as much as an adult can. Her timing and delivery is well-established and crafted almost as if she's been doing this work for decades.

I can't say anything bad about Let Me In because I haven't seen the original to compare and mostly because I really enjoyed the movie. Perhaps it's my favourtism of romance movies and I am fascinated by Moretz and child actor leads, but whatever the reason, I believe Let Me In is going to be a great success with audiences.

I'm not one for "scary" movies, but this movie was so much more than that. And in a time where I'm becoming more and more reluctant to watch vampire films, I needed a movie like this to remind me just how good this type of subject matter can be. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz were phenomenal. They brought a subtlety to there characters that was gently heartbreaking at times, while exquisitely silent and perceptive at others. The dynamic of the characters was tangible, and the viewer ends up with a sense - not of whether the actions of the characters are right or wrong or whether vampirism itself is okay when presented with the face of a 12-year-old girl - but of whether they themselves believe in the rightness or wrongness of where the story takes this young boy. Unlike most "scary" movies, this one leaves the viewer with something to think about when they leave the theater. And if that's not good storytelling, I don't know what is.

The soundtrack was beautifully mellow at times as well as keeping on point for the more thrilling parts of the film. The shots were lovely and simple at times and rather artistically impressive at others.

From the very beginning we are treated to spectacular creepiness. Who is the man who covered himself in acid? What kind of a strange young man wears a mask and pretends to stab girls? Who are the new neighbors that move in under cover of dark? This film is much more violent and has more suspense than the original, a Swedish film hailed as a landmark in vampire cinema, which might turn off some people but it really made it great for me. The film was a roller coaster of emotion and rhythm, each tender scene followed by a horrific moment. Some people may feel that it moves too slowly, but each quiet moment is meant to be enjoyed because deafening horror is soon to follow.

Overall it is not just a vampire story. It is the story of a lonely boy who finds companionship in the most unusual place. It is a wonderful study of human nature and asks important questions. Are there truly evil people in the world? And are they always evil, or can they actually be wonderful in the eyes of some? One of the great strengths of this film is that it constantly moves between two worlds--the sweetness of youth, and the horror of what a vampire really is. We get a front row seat to both and must decide if the evil outweighs the good.

I can't think of the last time I saw a vampire movie that impressed me as much. This has all the blood and action that was missing from the original, but maintains its commitment to carefully revealing the characters to us. There are wonderfully creepy additions and a truly artistic filming of a car crash that elevate this film onto a different level than the original. If you are a fan of horror films this one is not to be missed!

"Let Me In" is an adaptation of the Swedish Horror Classic "Let The Right One In". Being an adaptation many fans of the original may have been against the idea of an adaptation on the basis of many adaptations of other films in the past which had failed to do the original justice, those fans should be happy to know that "Let Me In" not only does the original's brilliance justice, but builds upon it to give an even better experience, and a new take of an excellent story to those who will see this film.

"Let Me In" (LMI) will make you do what the title asks, it will make you open your mind, heart and subconscious where it will plant a seed that will grow and continue to haunt you long after you have left the theater. Unlike most Horror genre movies these days LMI is a movie that doesn't lean heavily on visual effects and gore to scare you. Instead LMI builds its foundation in an already excellent story, complimented with great direction, acting, and cinematography. Normally the horror genre is one I choose to avoid due to the frequent use of cheap visual thrills rather then hard hitting emotional trauma and mental unrest. This is where LMI transcends the genre, as it is a film with depth and emotion that will truly stay with you long after the lights come on.

The acting in LMI is award worthy, especially Chloe Moretz as Abby, who's acting is amazing and makes the film's most complex character work. Give her the statue please! Worth mention for those who have seen the original is compared to Lina Leadersson who did an exceptional job as Eli, Chloe was responsible for both the acting and the voice, while Lina was dubbed. Also award worthy is Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen, without Kodi's Owen to compliment Chloe's Abby the film would have lacked a soul and fell flat despite a great story.

The one area I thought the film lacked compared to the original was Musical Score, whole LMI has an excellent musical score, it is far more direct than the brilliant and creepy Score that supported the original, just nitpicking here though.

In my opinion LMI is a brilliant movie which perfectly compliments the original, as well as one of the best this year.

9.6/10

***Spoilers Below This Point***

I hope my review doesn't come off as disjointed since I have separated the spoilers from the rest of the review.

LMI is driven only by the relationship between Owen and Abby, two brilliantly conceived and acted characters. 

Abby is a very complex character, many on the IMDb boards have taken Abby to be a pure evil, calculative, and manipulative 200 year old lady who has perfected the art of tricking others into helping her, I do not agree with this. Abby's character is brilliant because despite these 200 years that she has lived, she is still a 12 year old trapped inside of a monster. There are many hints throughout the movie that evidence this. For example when Abby's caretaker fails to bring back blood for her she is furious because she will now be forced to do the sinful deed herself. Abby's reluctance to get her own hands dirty is evidence that somewhere inside her the 12 year old girl still lives, rather than an insatiable monster who would jump at the chance to enjoy adrenaline pumping moments of a kill. This makes Abby kind of an ironic character, she is defined by her disease as a creature that lusts for human blood, as well as one with the power to obtain it herself, but instead she is reluctant to do so when it can be avoided, because somewhere inside her the 12 year old human girl still lives.

Owen is also a very complex character, but in a way that almost is the inverse of Abby. Owen is a helpless school boy constantly tormented by bullies in his school. He is weak, and has a poor family foundation with his parents going through a divorce. But, when we look into his character, and in certain scenes, we see he has a desire to do harm to his tormentors. One example of this is the scene where he is stabbing the tree with the knife and pretending that it is the group of bullies that torment him on a daily basis. So his character can be described as a weak 12 year old human boy, who wishes for the power to exact his revenge on his tormentors and imagines doing them as well, yet he still lacks the power to do so.

If one looks at this Owen and Abby work sort of like the puzzles Abby loves in that each of them compliment a void in the other, hence when they are together they are complete and they are happy. This is what makes them a perfect match, as when Abby is with Owen she can be her 12 year old self which the majority of her clearly prefers to be, and on the opposite end of the spectrum Owen is no longer lonely and at the same time has someone who has the power to defend him.

Neither of these characters would be even remotely believable without strong performances to back them up.

LMI is also one of the greatest Romantic Tragedies ever made, because despite the happy tone the film ends on, one is assured there is nothing but trouble ahead. Either Owen will outgrow Abby and due to his love decide to keep himself useful and become her replacement caretaker, or she will choose to share her curse with him, where both will have to share in the curse of what a Vampire is a Victim.

Did not expect much going into this movie. Just the basic hope that it was somewhat entertaining and made sense. It is amazing to me how easily a movie can go bad from a single action or phrase. This, however, was not the case for "Let Me In". It was flawless! A perfect combination between a captivating storyline and interesting characters that have an almost fairytale like interaction. At the same time feeling completely natural. Add to that an amazing soundtrack that submerges you even more into the characters world. I have always found the "this is how it would actually be" approach in depicting fiction and supernatural stories to be more captivating and effective. The movie is a complete underdog and is definitely worth seeing. Walked away wowed!!!

A life as a companion and living on the run is better than living without love. This is a film for the bullied and unwanted children in our world. The roles portrayed were executed with honesty by all actors involved. The director was clever in not showing the mother's face for very long and we never see the father. The poor lad is left pretty much alone to face the cold, wintry world without a single friend. Then comes the new girl. She seems as utterly sad and alone as he..... and she is. It was refreshing to see how their chemistry blended and bloomed. The only fault I found was the CG attack scenes. That was unbelievable for me. I would have portrayed a vampire as having total control and with slow, deliberate moves. Imagine a fiend that would regard his next meal with detached urgency. That would be much more scary. After all is said I believe that this film will be regarded on it's own as a good love story although with some mayhem and gore that makes a fine cocktail to patiently consider as a film thats heads's above many other horror films .

This is not your typical horror film, though it does have horror elements (e.g. suspense, violence, gore). Really it's a story about the complex loving relationship that develops between two children. The fact that one of them is a vampire just makes things more interesting.

I read the book and watched the original film before seeing this adaptation. Even so, I ended up twisting in my seat the whole film. I couldn't find a single dull moment. The whole theater was ewwing and awwing and giggling. 

This film has its flaws, but it's very emotionally affecting nonetheless. It's thrilling and disturbing, and as real as a film can be. I can't wait to watch it again.

- Compared w/ the First Film Adaptation -

I say it's better than the original because more time is spent on the principle characters and the changes tend to make the story more believable.

I prefer the acting and cinematography of the original film, but overall I think this is the best film adaptation anyone could hope for.

Before finding out about this film, I had no knowledge of the book nor seen the Swedish film adaptation of "Let the Right One In." After first seeing a TV spot for "Let Me In", I got the impression that this was going to be a very original vampire story unlike any other. I went in the theater keeping my expectations leveled and I came out with a sense of complete satisfaction.

"Let Me In" feels fresh and it left a good impression on me. The pacing of the film felt right and the cast did a great job. I got to praise Chloe Moretz's portrayal of Abby/Eli. The character of Abby is so eerie and it is never implied if she is really manipulating Owen for her own motives or if she genuinely cares for him. As a vampire, she is a ruthless monster that will stop at nothing to murder a helpless victim to satisfy her cravings for blood. As a "twelve year old" girl, she appears innocent and comes off as introverted. Overall, I feel that there is a lot of tragedy in the character of Abby, but the question is does she really have a heart? I would like to think she does, but I cannot give a straight answer to that, so that would be up to the viewer to decide.

Kodi Smit-McPhee does a good job playing Owen. You can really feel a sense of alienation in Owen's world due to the constant bullying from his classmates and having nobody to rely on. It is easy to see why he develops a friendship with Abby who also happens to be a loner living the type of lifestyle she does. It was a treat to watch scenes with these two together, because it sheds a bit of light in a film with such a dark tone. Not only that, but it helps prevent "Let Me In" from being classified as a straight up horror movie.

There are some pretty gory moments in the film, but overall, the whole thing stays focused on the character's interactions. The film does a good job by staying focused on the relationship between Abby and Owen and not relying on violence to completely overtake the film.

I also got to give Richard Jenkins props for playing Abby's father. There is a lot to this character and I couldn't help but feel sympathy for him. All of his scenes are intense and a pleasure to watch.

I praise this film for introducing me to such a beautiful story. I feel a personal connection to "Let Me In." It really hits me on a deep level of emotion. I know there are people that feel that this film should not have been made, but If it was not for this film, I probably would not have known about the novel or the Swedish adaptation of "Let the Right One In." Update: After watching "Let the Right One In", I feel that these two movies are similar, but they each have it's own differences which is enough to make both the Swedish and American version stand on its own. The Swedish version blew me away just like the American version, but in ways that are different from how I reacted to the American version, which is a good thing.

Let Me In is a Hollywood remake of the Swedish version of the film Let the Right One In, that is based on the book. A lot of reviews on this website consist of the audience comparing the remake to the original having seen both. Well I haven't, but this looked liked an interesting film and I went to see only this afternoon at my local cinema. I thought this would be a good film but my expectations weren't exceedingly high and I was glad in a way as by the end it made me appreciate all the more for that reason.

As soon as the first scene comes up I was intrigued and my attention never wavered from the screen throughout the running time of the whole 105 minutes of the movie (minus the credits). The basic story consists of a lonely and bullied 12 year old boy Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) whose parents are getting divorced, whilst at school he is bullied by Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his two friends Mark and Donald. Meanwhile a 12 year old girl Abby (Chloe Moretz) and her father/guardian (Richard Jenkins) move in to Owen next door. Soon they strike up a friendship as a unique bond forms between them, but she appears strange, at one point Owen tells her she smells bad and despite it being winter with snow on the ground, she often goes outside in the courtyard of the flats they live in to see him barefoot without any shoes, but dosen't feel the cold. There is a reason as she has a terrible secret of being a vampire where her father goes out and kills innocent strangers to obtain their blood so she can survive and eventually Owen becomes entangled up in everything when he finds out her secret and he stays with her despite knowing the truth. 

This is a fantastic film from start to finish, it's beautifully made with a very bleak atmosphere. The cinematography gorgeously enforces this. It cleverly mirrors the loneliness the two children feel in their lives, Owen who is bullied with no friends and parents who are on a verge of divorce and Abby who is also socially isolated due to being a vampire along with her father who is torn at helping her but wanting to give up. This film takes an intelligent insight into two kids with fractured souls who fit together in a unique and unexplained way of being whole. The friendship that blossoms between them is wonderfully depicted and builds up in a believable pace. This is due to surprisingly excellent performances from McPhee and Moretz who perform a terrific job of capturing the essence of their characters and radiating a very mature presence on the screen, which is an incredible accomplishment. They are so superb that they put some of the adult actors I know to shame. Due to these terrific performances the chemistry is superb and it's a wonder to see them touch each others hands, hug one another or kiss on the cheek. This makes you feel for their predicament as you come to care about the characters and realise Owen will do anything to protect and be with Abby as they care about each other so much. 

The supporting performances like Richard Jenkins and Dylan Minnette is great and they deserved to be mentioned. Jenkins gives surprising depth at feeling torn at helping Abby, particularly in a heartbreaking scene when she touches his face as she can see the weight bearing on him of what he does and Minnette perfectly portrays the menacing bully who also in a way is like a lost soul just like Abby and Owen when you see him being bullied by his older brother, which partly explains why he is so mean to others like Owen. 

Director Matt Reeves has done also a sensational job on striking a precise balance between the tone of the film where we feel disgusted and scared at how Abby is, what she is doing, but also saddened by her and Owen's predicament and moved in a happy and sad way by the friendship between her and Owen. This is helped by the lovely music by Michael Gucchino who uses it effectively at the perfect time when Owen and Abby spend time together.

The dialogue and script is good too, particularly the facial expressions McPhee and Moretz make. The special effects of when you see Abby's face contorted when she eats is brilliant as it is terrifying. Also it is beautifully shot with some interesting camera shots. For example we never see Owen's mother's face, which I don't know if anyone else noticed was intriguing. It certainly got me thinking that even with his mum, Owen feels truly alone and the (whether intentional or not) never seeing his mum's face could depict the further isolation he also feels from his own family and that she isn't really there in Owen's world as it's just him and Abby. 

Matt Reeves has to be commended for a stupendous achievement of making a film that is beautifully made and can connect with the audience on a emotional level. I first saw Chloe Moretz acting in (500) Days of Summer and Kick-ass. She was terrific in that and she has grown since then and is turning into a superb and mature young actress. Kodi Smit-McPhee from The Road, which I saw him in earlier this year I found to be an engaging young actor, with lots of potential and it's lovely to see him continue to fulfil that. This connected to me on every level and has become one of my favourite movies of this year and though it may not receive Oscars, it certainly deserves to be nominated. I am very pleased with the IMDb rating on here. Let Me In has a powerful resonant that radiates to it's audience, I'm glad I let this film in. Absolutely incredible.

I went to see this film two weeks ago with my Mum (who loves horror films just as much as me) and although we went expecting to be frightened, we were entertained much more than with a few scares. We were however, shocked that we were the only ones in the cinema and for this reason did not expect the film to be as good as it turned out to be! Having seen the original (Let The Right One In) 18 months ago, I was more impressed with the 2010 remake (which doesn't happen often!) The two main characters Owen and Abbey draw you into the story and into their lives. Owen, a 12 year old boy who has no friends, an alcoholic mother and is being bullied at school and Abbey, a young vampire girl who relies on her keeper to feed her. Also a loner, Abbey befriends Owen and later in the film we learn that he will replace her current keeper (Richard Jenkins). Unlike usual horror films, Let Me In shows the reasoning behind the villains motives and similarly to We Are What We Are, the audience is intrigue by the killer and are let encouraging their behaviour. Unlike We Are What We Are, Let Me In is much more than a horror film, its a story of friendship, teenage anxieties and family break ups and for this reason I give the film 10/10. A highly recommendable, enjoyable, believable portrait of Vampire life (if there were such thing) which is acted and directed faultlessly.

From Wikipedia: Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote "Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years." 

Personally, how can I top the master writer himself with my own praise? This is the best horror film I have seen since "The Shining." The relationship between Owen and Abby was beautiful and complex, and was masterfully done by the two young actors. So masterful for their age I was immersed immediately! The story was superb and their chemistry was perfection. The acting by Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic, as could be expected and cannot be overlooked. 

The cinematography and musical soundtrack were a perfect combination to create atmosphere and feeling. The orchestral music furthered the intensity and seriousness of Abby's need to feed, and protect, but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social rebellion and awkward sexual curiosity. I was personally further drawn in because of being bullied at that same age, with no friends to rely on. The solitude and emotional pain are immense. I could only dream as mostof having an mature and loyal friend like Abbey to help me through that tough time..

The strength that Abby provides, and ultimately uses to rid this problem for Owen is enormous and addictive. (much like this film!) Thus it is easy to see why he would leave with her immediately and forgo the average life. I am addicted to this beautiful work. Very few things inspire or move me anymore. But this film captures a powerful moment in the human condition even with it's fictional elements. Though a realist, I am currently in fantasia. Though cynical, I am currently inspired by greatness. In a time when horror films pretty much suck, It was a privilege to see this masterfully done work of art.

Whether you are a fan of Gothic horror or not Let Me In is well worth a viewing and by no means is it just a "scary film" it is so much more than that. Before I go into the film itself I have to comment that this is a re-make of a Swedish film called "Let The Right One In" from 2008 and both films come from the novel of the same name by Swedish author Tomas Alfredson.

The film itself is a masterpiece and hats off to director Matt Reeves for brilliant work on what was a difficult task re-making an already loved film for American audiences (and all those who don't like subtitles). The film is shot in the eerie Los Alamos, New Mexico snow, mostly at night time and it is truly gorgeous and the dark, cold land gives a real genuine vibe to the tale and you feel Owen's despair .

The story itself centers on Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is a twelve year old child whose parents are going through a divorce and is a victim of bullying, he lives with his mother and is dangerously isolated and becoming slightly weird. All his problems are answered when the amazing Abby (Chloë Moretz) moves into the apartment next door. She is a self assured twelve year old who helps Owen overcome his bullying problems, gives him someone to love and their friendship blossoms.

However all is not right with Abby who is played by the highly capable Chloë Moretz, (Hit Girl in Kickass) her performance is remarkable and the chemistry with her and Kodi Smit is all the more special when you take into account they are only children. You feel every touch, you love every second Abby and Owen are together their bond is beautiful yet you know all is not well. Abby is a vampire, she "needs blood to live" and she will do anything to get it, indeed even jump on an innocent persons back as they go for a nice jog and feast on their blood. Yes there are plenty of shock moments in this film it is scary but its more than that.

Like Owen we (the audience) has to see past the fact Abby is a vampire and become immersed in this special and beautiful friendship and we do; thanks to the performances of both Kodi and Chloë, that are nothing short of brilliant, and long may they succeed.

LET ME IN (2010) **** Chloe Moretz, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Richard Jenkins, Cara Buono, Elias Koteas, Dylan Minnette. Eerie and excellent Hollywood remake to the Swedish import vampire film "Let The Right One In" scores on all points particularly the smart casting of Smit-McPhee and Moretz (both stars on the rise, justly so) as (respectively) a put-upon tween whose life changes in more ways than one when his new neighbor, a pale barefoot girl, moves in his apartment complex with her dubious guardian (Jenkins in fine low-key form), resulting in a sinister yet romantic kinship. Director Matt Reeves builds up enough suspense, tension and lets the blood flow copiously with élan in this, the finest vampire film since Kathryn Bigelow's "NEAR DARK". The poignant puppy-love story and dark underpinnings of the undead and the living attempting to bond is both heart breaking and fear inducing. One of the year's best films (NOTE: Although I didn't see the original foreign film I'm sure it's a worthy adaptation).

OK So Let the Right One In is one of my favorite films so when I heard they were going to Americanize it, I knew one thing for sure, I'd be obligated to see it just to compare it to the brilliant original.

So here we are a year or so later and after seeing this movie all I can say is I was completely blown away! This movie is as good if not better than the Swedish original and it's my job to tell everyone why...

This movie is almost exactly the same as the Swedish original except it has some more terror and fear then the almost non-frightening original. The two movies are so close that I knew exactly what dialogue was coming next... Kinda like Will Smith in I Am Legend. Now it's one thing to copy scenes and another to have the top notch acting to go along with it. Well I can honestly say the two leads completely nail their parts to the point where you stop believing it is a vampire movie and an actual story of friendship and courage.

Matt Reeves succeeded at what many failed to do... make a fantastic sequel up to par with the original, not to mention a good horror movie. I firmly believe this film will be overlooked when Oscar time comes because of it being a box office flop. This is a shame that this masterpiece has been overlooked by so many people.

Let Me In is a remake of the Swedish film Let The Right One In. I made it a point to watch the original before trekking off to the theater to see the remake. I was quite surprised at how much the American remake held true to the general feel of the first film without watering down the contents.

The original has more mature and dark undertones while the newer version is more "cute".

The factors that make Let Me In stand out from other films is its sincerity and honesty. I have not seen a movie this sincere in a long time. The movie is classified as a Drama/Fantasy/Horror/Romance. It does cover all those genres, but with no emphasis on any specific one. The film takes upon all these segments ever so delicately. They are also portrayed deliberately enough so that you pay attention throughout the entirety of the piece.

It is a very sweet and sincere film with dark notes. I definitely recommend this film to any of my friends.

I am in a strange position reviewing this film, as I had already watched the first 30 minutes of the original movie, but hadn't finished it. So on the one hand I was comparing the two movies and was really interested to see what the whole story had to offer. First of all, an excellent story from the Swedish? author. As a novelist who has written his own supernatural thriller, I feel somewhat humbled that my story is a bit clichéd, this one most certainly wasn't. The romance between awkward schoolboy and undead vampire was masterful. The acting from the two young main leads was quite superb and I am sure are two future stars in the making. The direction by Matt Reeves was superlative, keeping the same pace as the original. Now that I have seen this, I will have to go back and finish the original movie as well. I don't want to ruin the story for others out there, but the ending of the film was quite simply mind blowing, and one wonders how far back in time our young lady has been finding and making friends with impressionable young men. I could feel some people in the audience were a bit fidgety with this movie because it is not a typical horror movie, rather it is a multi-layered social documentary on isolation and friendship, on being different and being alone in a crowd. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 was the dislike for so many reviewers on this website who give out tens to the most banal movies. Minus two points if you don't like vampires and it still gets a 7/10! A must see.

Both Let the Right One in and Let Me In are both masterful bites on the vampire genre and cinema alone. With both films I felt the exact same sensation. It was a mixture of every adolescent feeling I had endured throughout my life. For me its beyond a movie going experience, it's being absorbed into a thing of beauty and art. This is when you know you are being wrapped up into something that will forever leave an impression on you.

If your not familiar with the original's story, which is kept essentially as the exact same thing in Let Me In, tells the story of a lonely pre- pubescent boy whom is an extreme outsider of anything relatively well, that has to do with life. This connection he can't make is due to the hindrance from the lonely home life being endured from a divorce mother and bullies at school. The boy evokes every attribute of innocence, something that is trying to be corrupted against his will thus the loneliness. All is cold and somewhat hopeless until a mysterious young girl who is the same age as Owen moves into the same apartment complex. After nights of awkward mingling on the freezing, iced over playground belonging to the apartment complex, Owen and the mysterious Abby who only comes out at night barefoot, finally make an immediate intimate connection. Oh yes, did I forget to mention that Abby is a vampire? From there the film spirals into the emotions of lost childhood, innocence, beauty, regretful violence, and every intimate emotion that has been dealt with in life.

What has made this story so great from the start is that its a tale of emotion, and not horror. But more importantly the horror of our confused emotions as children. We have all felt this and we can all connect to it. 

The story of Let Me in is constructed beautifully by Matt Reeves' chilling directing. Some shots evoke a mirror image of the original thus showing his infinite amount of respect for the original. Yet Reeves adds enough of his own talent to make it his own vision. There is one scene in which I won't spoil that is probably one of the most well constructed scenes I have seen in quite some time. Reeves knows how to direct quite moments of loneliness, and pulse pounding action scenes. The best addition to the directing is the tone of the film. When you watch it, you feel cold, and you feel as if your in New Mexico with the characters.

All the acting in the film is sensational rivaling they're Sweedish counterparts. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit Mcphee are flat out THE BEST child actors alive. Kodi as Owen portrays the feeling of lost innocence with spot on portrayal. Although Chloe as Abby isn't physically as menacing as her Sweedish counterpart, she plays the role with the right amount of anger, and the look of a lost soul. Watching these two characters interact is a true privilege.

If there are any problems with the film, its with the Richard Jenkins character which is Abby's caretaker who drains his victim's blood for Abby to feed off. The problem I had with this version of the character juxtapose to the original's is that the character's back story is kept completely ambiguous in the original. In Let Me In there is sort of a hint as to who he was at one time. This felt as if the filmmakers were depriving the audience of letting us use our imagination. This isn't to say Richard Jenkins gave a bad performance though. He is actually quite good as this character.

With one subjective criticism aside, Let Me In is truly a remarkable film. A film that doesn't come around too often. Its something that you make an actual intimate connection to. After its viewing you feel as if you have relived your journey of growing out of adolescence. 

Something we all miss right?

Reeves has done it. Saw this at Fantastic Fest with director and cast present and I have to say I was very impressed. The acting is great as my heart went out to Kodi's character Owen. I honestly wanted to jump into the screen and make the cruelty stop. It was heartbreaking. Chloe is a wonderful actress and she portrays Abby very well. I wanted a bit more from that character but it is good. The scenes together are very good and sweet. Jenkins who plays the caregiver is very very good. His portrayal is a very real and creepy take. His means of attaining victims was chilling. His character climax is great, my jaw dropped.

Reeves does a wonderful job with cinematography and I loved the setting. I have been eagerly awaiting this movie and I was not disappointed. If you have seen the original you still haven't seen Let Me In.

As a big fan of the original, it was with much trepidation when I read that it was going Hollywood. Too many examples of bad remakes exist to bother naming them. Then again, lightning occasionally hits the target, too. Matt Reeves' remake is a lightning strike! While there are minor changes, there are fewer thematically or otherwise than in, for example, critical successes like Harry Potter or LOTR. So the real question becomes: does it succeed in creating its own reality? Happily the answer is a resounding YES! There's little purpose served in hair-wringing comparing it to the original. Better to enjoy two artfully-crafted versions of the story, each with their own unique merits. Take note filmmakers - this is how to remake a foreign-language movie into an English-language one. Like a great singer who covers another artist's definitive song, it does no disservice to the original when it's newly owned.

Its reassuring to say the least that while highly renown, yet highly divided vampire films (Twilike or a Twifright) can leave an irritable stain on media, the lesser known films can have more humanity, pungency and raw emotion that the tips of the latter could scarcely touch. The cult clamped Swedish horror: Let The Right One In was sadly still in the airbrushed shadow cast from it fellow vampire films, despite being a remarkable exception that hadn't drowned in its own neck pierced blood.

So while the remake may have sparked frustrating and insensitive glares from the lovers of the original, Matt Reeves has faithfully and delicately delivered a worthy successor that too many remakes have made of a bad name of doing. This bend in the rule is like Cloverfield's deliberate use of shaky, amateur camera, which was either tirelessly memorable or sickly forgettable. Let Me In is just the same. A point-blank refusal to even look at the trailer ticks the forgettable box, while enjoying, or even admitting it's as good as the original ticks the other. In several small but noticeable footsteps it actually goes as far as slightly improving on the Swedish version, but we'll let that point settle in before it's resurfaced and explained.

For Kodi Smit-McPhee's character Owen, things are as tough and lonely as they were earlier in the year when he was in The Road, and as for Chloe Moretz, she Kick's Ass in a very different way than when she was Hit Girl. Bullied Owen and Abbey first meet when she moves in next door, and their relationship begins to form one of great envy. Both being only twelve, the awkward overused issue of sex isn't on the playing court; their friendship is consoling each other with company of the other and finding comfort and understanding. A children's story with adult themes if you like.

Moretz and Smit-McPhee handle the awkward, defensive first meet with maturity and talent, more so than with the actors who played Oskcar and Eli. This makes their relationship throughout have more depth and meaning, so when it's good you smile and when it's bad you worry. This is something you rarely feel in a remake because the characters would have their paths so clearly outlined through a parallel plot of the predecessor, there's a lack of effort to care when you know what will happen. Not with Let Me In. The special effects are also an improvement on the original. The fits of hunger Eli had are nothing compared to the bone snapping aerobic attacks of Abbey, not to mention the welcoming departure of the original's hissing cats that boasted bad B-movie effects rather than successful cult Swedish horror.

But if anyone, deserves the most limelight for such a fantastic remake Reeves should be bestowed that honour. His scripting and artful direction doesn't feel the need to go full Hollywood (which was also his method for Cloverfield) and glamorise every little blip of action - for example the shot inside the car crashing. It's this faithfulness not to stray too far from the original's rigorous control but take risks that don't push the boundaries, which make this masterpiece as being every bit impressive it's original.

Supposedly based upon a true incident, as all "good" ghost stories are, this is the story of what happens when several people seek to remake a beloved modern classsic. It seems that a bullied young boy befriends a young female vampire who lives in secrecy with her guardian, a quest which opens up many doors that should remained closed. What happens from there will shake them, and the audience.

This is a good, quietly disturbing horror film. It's a film that relies on mood and lighting and half caught images to slowly build the tension. When was the last film that sent chills up and down your spine with just the sound of a creak? Or a lot of creaks? This is a film that is mostly free of fancy special effects. The vampires we see are decidedly low tech, but they are effective. They are glimpsed on the edges of the frame in the background, and occasionally right in front of one of out protagonists. It all helps to build to a real sense of unease. I don't know when I was left feeling this uneasy. Certainly I don't know when a film invaded my dreams and had me dreaming of ghosts all night. This is not a film of scares and screams, there are a few jumps and starts, but mostly this is a film of slowly building dread that never is fully dissipated.

Its not a perfect film. It's a film that has a great deal going on that isn't said. Things are implied between characters. The narrative kind of wanders and moves with a dream logic that seems to leave things out. It builds tension but also a bit of confusion. I kept feeling I was missing something. The films ending, which I'm sure was truly terrifying in a theaters, works less well on home video. Its still bothered me, but not as much as it would have had I been in a theater.

Over all this was a pleasant surprise for me. Normally I'm up and down with Swedish horror remakes, finding them either truly scary or more times than not dull and boring. This was neither dull nor boring. This was a more than slightly unnerving experience. Definitely worth a look, especially if you're curled up in a dark room on a stormy night.

Fans of Kick Ass's Chloe Moretz don't go in expecting "Hit Girl does Dracula". Moretz is great, but in a totally different way. She's sad, creepy, and downright scary.

I enjoyed the entire cast, Kodi Smit-McPhee was also very good as Abby's human "friend". Richard Jenkins didn't have as much screen time as I thought he would but was good as usual.

Some great cinematography throughout too. One in particular was a car crash done from an unusual perspective. Also some effective use of music in several scenes.

This kind of vampire situation is one that I've wondered about since seeing Interview with a Vampire. The "child vampire" is a story left unexplored for the most part. Let Me In gets into what that would be like and still lets you use your imagination...a good balance between the two.

Abby does not have a good life. There is nothing cool about it and she doesn't get to sparkle in the sun or wear goth outfits to school. As you would imagine, she is a lonely creature who does long for companionship and seems to need caring for. She's an "old soul" obviously (we are never told exactly how old) but seems to have retained quite a bit of her childlike needs. We are repulsed by her at times and feel great sympathy for her at other times. Several moments will tug at your heartstrings. The simple act of eating a piece of candy or a tentative attempt at human contact. The end is a bittersweet resolution. A kind of "the cycle continues" type thing. You can see the whole thing playing out again years into the future (which would be today).

Understandable that fans of the original would be upset about this one but some are determined to hate it. They seem to forget the original movie was based on someone else's work as well. But this really is a great movie and the story deserves to be seen by English audiences. Like every society on earth, English speaking audiences are going to enjoy a movie made in their own language more than a dubbed or sub-titled one. I have no problem with sub-titles myself, but I don't see why it's a sin to not like them. I wonder if Indian movie watchers are made to feel guilty if they don't like English movies with sub-titles? The original wasn't a hit, so at least a few more people will see this great story. Reeves also changes quite a few things about the story...some are major changes which I feel improve upon the original. (The Caretaker is completely different)

As a huge fan of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In" (In my top 10 favorite films of all time), I was excited to find out about the American remake, but also worried. I however did have faith in it. Owen is a 12 year old boy who is constantly bullied in school and lives with his over protective religious mother. Then along comes Abby, the new 12 year old next door neighbor. The performances by Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Chloe Grace Moretz were absolutely astounding. These two slowly start to form a bond throughout the film, until something strange about Abby starts to show up. She is a vampire who has her current guardian out murdering people and bringing back blood for her to feed upon. Although the film has its gruesome moments it is not a horror film, it is a love story between two children and the forming of their bond. The films directing was beautiful, Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield really had some great shots in this film, (I.E. when the nurse in the hospital looks for Abby outside). The film shows true dedication between two children and how although both kids are a little messed up, they are perfect for each other. The only complaints I really had about this film was how Abby looked when she was feeding on blood, she looked very grainy and exorcist-ish, I didn't find it necessary but I did not dwell on it at all. For people who feel as if an American remake is not necessary, go watch it. "Let Me In" is a beautiful story that deserves to be given a chance. I'm also not afraid to say that it rivals the original. Great acting, great directing, and just truly, truly, truly a masterpiece.
