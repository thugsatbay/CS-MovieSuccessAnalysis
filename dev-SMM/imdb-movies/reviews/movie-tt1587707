### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Exit Through the Gift Shop, the first film directed by reclusive street-art legend Banksy, is a little puzzle-box of a documentary. It's perfectly designed and pitched to be enjoyable on multiple levels: on one as an entertaining, illuminating mini-history of "street art" and on another - one entirely more convoluted and entertaining - as a light-hearted "up yours" to both street artists and their patrons.

Ostensibly (to take the film's word for it) Banksy's film came about when he, as the premiere 21st Century graffiti art darling, was approached by Thierry Guetta, a French-born Los Angeleno. Guetta wanted to make a documentary about street art, and Banksy was the last major figure whose participation he felt he needed, as an affable personality, a love of video cameras and a chance relationship to Invader, a French street-art pioneer who networked with other artists like Shepard Fairey, had left Guetta with hundreds of hours of footage documenting the birth of the art.

After tracking Banksy down and shooting him working, Guetta retired to the cutting room. He emerged months later and showed it to Banksy. He didn't like the film, a couple of minutes of which are excerpted and are plainly terrible, and offered to take over Guetta's doc while Guetta returned to Los Angeles to turn himself into a street art sensation, named "Mr. Brainwash" or MBW. Transforming overnight from an affable, helpful documentarian to a one-man hype-monster artiste, MBW's enormous spraypaint cans, TV monsters and Warhol-style send-ups captured the attention of the LA art crowd, who spent over a million bucks on his stuff, much to the chagrin of Fairey and Banksy. Guetta's film about Banksy changes into Banksy's film about Guetta and street art, and the rise of a new unfortunate talent.

Except, as I and a lot of other folks believe, it's all made up. It's a hoax, it has to be, it's too hilariously perfect to be anything but. Banksy, as a street artist, has seen the perception of his works - by design temporary, and by design defacements - change from graffiti into art that needs preservation, that is cut out from walls and sold. Banksy, in making Exit Through the Gift Shop with Fairey and Guetta has found a way to deface, scrawl over and heap lighthearted disdain all over both himself and the people who snap up his art.

It's spectacular, it's brilliant and all the more so in that it's still a documentary, still a record of events. It's not artificial, not a mockumentary in the way that Spinal Tap is. MBW exists, having been created by Guetta or Banksy or both, and the film documents his arrival. Exactly who it is that arrives is the film's mystery.

Exit Through the Gift Shop captures the birth of a prank, an elaborate, entertaining gotcha that fits perfectly in Banksy's nose-tweaking, politically-aware, cheeky body of work. Moreover, the film doesn't rely on any rug-snapping-out to really work. It works if it's true, it works if it's not, because it's a construction that's above all entertaining. It's a glimpse, anyway, of a world that's built at night, by streetlight, one that's fascinating even if it is in the middle of pulling the wool over our eyes. It's genius, plain and (not so very much at all) simple.

It took me a while to get a chance to see this film: anybody who was around Bristol last summer for Banksy's 'Homecoming' exhibition will be aware of the popularity of the city's most celebrated son, and therefore I shouldn't have been surprised that when the first three times I tried to see the film the cinema was sold out. However, I got there in the end.

In my admittedly naïve opinion, street art is one of the most significant art movement of the 21st century. Its attraction lies in the fact that it is one of the most democratic forms of visual art  there is a conscious rejection of the safety net of critical censorship or gallery authority. Instead, the public are engaged with artists' work throughout the course of their daily lives, and it is up to them to conclude which side of the line this kind of work treads  is it graffiti, a public menace and an eyesore, or is it a work of art that has a right to be displayed wherever the artist chooses? I'm rambling. However, I wanted to establish my feelings towards street art as a whole before engaging with Banksy's satirical and humorous representation of it within Exit Through the Gift Shop.

To the film 

Banksy's first foray into film-making drags his unique sweet and sour mix of humour and political satire kicking and screaming onto the silver screen. Anyone hoping for a revelation of his true identity is to be disappointed  the film opens with a blacked-out figure of a man in a hood, and whilst the Bristol accent defies the voice alteration, it's clear that this film is not designed to be a personal unmasking. Rather, Banksy's humour has a very different kind of revelation in mind.

The true hero (or perhaps anti-hero would be a better description) is the curiously care-free French shop-keeper/amateur filmmaker, whose interest in graffiti artists is borne out of a chance confrontation with the artist known as 'Space Invader'. The film follows Guetta's attempts to capture his encounters with various street artists, including the notorious Banksy, on camera, and in the process Banksy encourages Guetta to create a documentary out of the ridiculous amount of film that he has amassed over several years of his life.

Unfortunately, Guetta, although a handy cameraman, is quite clearly not a filmmaker. Part of Banksy's skill in creating this film is that it makes us ask just who is the director in this haphazard process. One of the frequently-quoted lines of the film comes from Banksy himself, saying "it's basically the story of how one man set out to film the un-filmable. And failed." The character of Guetta that we see on screen is simply ridiculous, and yet we are attracted by his attitude of naivety. He is a hugely entertaining personality, and even more so because he appears to take himself so seriously. Even Banksy cannot quite know what to make of him. Is he a disguised genius, or a fool who got lucky? Either way, Banksy's portrayal of the way in which Guetta engages with the art world breathes new life into that clichéd question of what actually gives art both aesthetic and financial value. With the help of Rhys Ifans' superbly wry narration, the film conducts us through the emergence of the street art counterculture, and how perceptions of it have changed within the political, artistic and social establishment.

There are so many things that could be said about this film, but it is dangerous to say more without ruining the sense of the unexpected that the film generates. That is a tribute to the intricacy of the documentary narrative, in which real life personalities generate the same thrill of the unknown as fictional plot lines. Suffice it to say, I left feeling lusciously confused  who was I in the end laughing at or with? In the face of Banksy's teasingly ironic vision, no one is left unscathed. Not even us. Not even Banksy himself.

Exit Through the Gift Shop is credited as "a film by Banksy", who is a notorious and perhaps the most popular and widely acclaimed (and the premiere provocateur) in the group of street artists from the past several years. Yet his credit as director is something of a lark; he's never directed before, and he claims at the end of the film that this will be the last time he helps someone make a documentary on street artists. The bulk of the footage shot was by another artist (or some would say 'so-called'), Theirry Guetta, a former clothing store owner who used to take super-cheap and mis-made clothes and sell them for rocket-high prices as if they were designer wear, who started taping everything one day, just whatever was around him. Then, when his cousin, nicknamed 'Space Invader', took him around to show him how he put up his stenciled artwork around town, Thierry became enamored and followed anyone who would let him around town with his camera.

Soon, a documentary was looking like it was taking shape, but was it really? At one point, after years of filming and amassing such a large collection that it would make all OCD-ers cringe, he did try and make a documentary out of it called 'LIFE REMOTE CONTROL - THE MOVIE', which Banksy, upon watching it, didn't really know what to say, since he hated it and couldn't really put it in words. Thierry wasn't a filmmaker, and he wasn't an artist, but he went after doing both anyway, and it's him that Banksy makes the focus of, taking his masses of footage- most of it on street artists who remain anonymous (only a few, like Shepard Fairey who made the red and blue Obama poster so iconic, go unblurred on camera)- and telling this story of this... kind of nutty guy, and how somehow, by his determination and, indeed, some mental imbalance, he became "Mr. Brain-Wash", a self-created art phenomenon that is basically a huge collection of Andy Warhol rip-off screen prints of celebrities (how huge you might ask? Well, there's a reason I kept thinking of Howard Hughes during the film, and a Spruce Goose comparison isn't far off).

Banksy says at the start he didn't want Thierry doing a documentary on him since he didn't think he was very interesting, and turned the camera on his original documentarian instead. I wonder though how much of this is really true, or perhaps just part of Banksy's own mystique; the guy is like The Shadow of street artists, with a touch of Tyler Durden. He pops up, does his thing, and leaves, trying to get by with his "gray-legal-area" artwork in Britain and elsewhere, and making waves with his real provocative pieces (i.e. the art on the Palestine wall, and especially the stunt at Disneyland, which is one of the most fascinating parts of the film). He remains a shadow unto himself on screen, becoming like one of his stencils in a silhouette form and a voice muffled by distortion. But then again, he knows that he can only be so self-indulgent - how can he keep up, for example, with a guy like Thierry Guetta.

He is the real star of the film, and he really is one of a kind, a genuinely interesting "character" who sometimes, ala Howard Hughes, repeats things a bit too much, and like Michael Scott on the Office can seem to put himself in some awkward positions. He's also good in a crunch (such as the Disneyland incident), and his very first piece of art- his own self-portrait as a guy with shaggy hair and a hat and a camera- was put all over town by himself and it's a genuinely good piece. And his how he relates to others if interesting too; he takes some really long stretches of time from his family, and those he documents like Shepard Fairey don't know whether he's a genuinely good guy or just wacko, or both in a single bound. Certainly when he is finally let loose, by way of a gentle suggestion by Banksy, to create his own art it becomes like pushing a river-boat over a mountain: something huge that should be impossible, but there it is, and WTF? 

The reaction to his art, and how people see it in the film (frankly I never heard of the guy, unlike Banksy, though I'm assuming he's a big deal in elite art circles), is mixed really. A guy who just pours out hundreds of pieces of art and paintings right away instead of taking years for the craft? What separates him from Banksy, and it's most likely what makes this such a great documentary, is the method of hype. That really is what is the hook here (I can imagine this being a fantastic double feature, by the way, with My Kid Could Paint That), that this guy ended up being such a sensation by pimping himself out there, getting on the cover of a magazine, without building up street cred (forgive the pun) that most of the artists shown here need to get. As Banksy notes, there are no real rules in art, though MBW probably did break them... which he can't really condemn nor condone exactly. He is what he is, and his big bushy sideburns lead up to passionate eyes and a sense of life and art that is... um, influenced? 

This is the only documentary you need to see on street art, if there even are any others. Perhaps Banksy means for this to be *the* statement on it and leave it at that. It kept me contemplating long after it was over, and I'm sure to revisit it many times. That I have only a minimal interest in street art should go without saying; Guetta, Banksy, and everyone else make this a must-see.

An experience will ultimately become a diluted memory, unless the experience itself is documented in image or film, in which case it will last forever (or until it is deleted/destroyed...). 'Exit Through The Gift Shop' is a brilliant examination of the underground street art culture, and a poignant look at man's obsession with a culture he is increasingly drawn into throughout his life.

Thierry Guetta (pronounced Te-ree), is a French immigrant living Los Angeles with his loving wife and children and a good honest job, but there is one object he will never leave the house without; his video camera. Guetta has been enticed into the everyday cinema verité movement of simply recording any, and everything that goes on in his life. From playing with his children, to his ultimate attraction of following other street artists around and documenting their work, Guetta loves to watch, document and admire from behind the lens. Guetta eventually earns the trust and respect of various artists around the globe including the elusive Banksy, his cousin Space Invader and Shepard Fairey, and provides the audience with an up close and personal view of a culture (or industry) which has been projected into the limelight over the past five years.

Narrated by Rhys Ifans, 'Exit' has been acknowledged as not having a registered director, instead it is a smoothly edited combination of Guetta's extensive and various filmed sequences from over the years (the film shows his EXTENSIVE physical collection of tapes from more than decade of film-making) and interviews with various leading figures in the industry. For example Banksy is interviewed at length over his involvement with Guetta and comes across as a very down-to-earth, humble and at times, incredibly funny person. While everybody, including Guetta, are extremely brazen and don't hold back when speaking about each other, their profession or how the street art culture has developed over time into a somewhat monopolistic environment (which can be viewed by the fact that the rich and famous turned out in droves for Banksy's first exhibition in the United States).

This isn't a film about 'graffiti' though, as some may simply see it as on the surface, aside from the exploration of a fast growing community it is also a deep, scary and heart-warming look at Thierry Guetta's life over a decade onwards as he constantly leaves behind his family and his job to follow various artists around the globe. Mentally unstable, or one of the greatest French minds of the last twenty years, nobody is quite sure what Thierry Guetta (also known as Mr Brainwash) is, but what everybody does acknowledge is that he is a man with a passion and while he may not follow the same ideology as everybody else, his heart is still in the right place. 'Exit Through The Gift Shop' is a fascinating documentary focusing on a rising culture that many people may not have much knowledge about, except for knowing the name of the elusive, and as I have mentioned, surprisingly hilarious Banksy.

Not that I felt the same thrill Thierry must have gotten while roaming the streets with street artists, I however admit to downloading the movie via torrent (yes its illegal), and so watched it in my own living room for anyone interested in the circumstances of the review.

Viewers should be reminded that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a documentary rather than a movie, but at the same time plays out more like an adventure movie than an educational one about street artists. Albeit being more down to earth, a fitting comparison could be Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.

Thierry Guetta is our main character and camera guy at the same time. While lurking behind the camera he tells us his intriguing story when his life took a sudden and distinct turn. He had became known as "the guy with the camera" - developing some kind of compulsive disorder after his mother passed. His argument that everything should be recorded or else abruptly might get lost at any point in life seems reasonable but his thousands of tapes, that nobody would ever watch, piled up in his basement confirms the maladaptive nature of his behavior. 

His compulsive filming became a useful tool first when he met a street artist that he began to follow - filming every event of the artists creative process. He sank deeper and deeper into the world of street artists and that became sort of an addiction to Thierry. He seemed to almost forget about his wife and kids. Exit Through the Gift Shop tells us as much about street artisting as it does about Thierry himself. Despite being, as he himself points out, "a ghost behind the camera", his character truly steals the show. This is by no means a problem but rather enrich the story with a greater purpose. Thierrys meeting with Banksy and the following episodes poses a lot of interesting questions about what art really is, what it means to humans, what talent is made of and even about complex group behavior. 

Despite being directed by a street artist and evidently put together from thousands of different tapes, Exit Through the Gift Shop is amazingly well directed. It doesn't feel hyped, it doesn't seem to lie or exaggerate the happenings and the fact that an interesting, motivated and special character gets to portrait everything from an outside view is fascinating to watch. My text is hardly enough to summarize it so the only tip i can give you is WATCH IT!

Exit Through the Gift Shop may be all smoke and mirrors but it is a highly provocative mirror we look into, one that raises many questions about the commercialization of art and even about the authenticity of the documentary form itself. Ostensibly directed by the mysterious British graffiti artist Banksy, the film, shot with a not too steady hand-held camera, describes the attempts by Los Angeles clothing store owner Thierry Guetta to capture on film the world of street artists, previously hidden from public view. Banksy, who has developed quite an underground reputation for outrageousness after posting his own paintings in the Met and other museums, is shown hooded, in shadows, and with his voice distorted.

He begins the film by explaining that the movie was supposed to be about him but when Guetta's attempt at film-making proved to be unwatchable, he took over the making of the film and it became a documentary about Guetta, and how he was transformed into the street artist known as "Mr. Brainwash". Narrated by Welsh actor Rhys Ifans (slotted to play Edward de Vere in the upcoming Roland Emmerich film Anonymous), Guetta is an garrulous and outgoing Frenchman who carries his video camera with him wherever he goes, filling up tape after tape. After meeting with his cousin known as Space Invader, a graffiti artist famous for mosaics showing characters from the Space Invader video game, he is introduced to Shepard Fairey, the man responsible for the Obama "hope" campaign in 2008 as well as street artists Monsieur André, Swoon, Sweet Toof, Borf, and many others.

Shepard and Thierry become partners in the clandestine world of graffiti-making and, even though Shepard feels that that there is something not quite right about Guetta, he is happy to have him around as a "security guard" who is willing to climb tall buildings to locate the most lucrative spots. Eventually, Thierry realizes that, in order for his film to be successful, he must find a way to find the reclusive Banksy. He finds Banksy, however, almost impossible to track down. The power of intention works wonders though, for on a trip to Los Angeles, Banksy himself contacts Thierry to ask for his help in finding the best places to post in L.A. The end result is an ongoing relationship and a Banksy art show called "Barely Legal" that does extremely well financially. As far as its artistic merits, I will leave that to others to decode.

After Banksy tells Guetta to leave his tapes with him and go put on his own show, Thierry does just that, renting an old CBS Studio and transforming it into a factory where he endeavors mightily to put on his own show "Life is Beautiful" under the name "Mr. Brainwash". The 2008 show, aided by an L.A. Weekly cover story, earns Thierry over one million dollars and catapults the Frenchman into the ranks of the world's most popular street artists. Exit Through the Gift Shop may be the real deal or it may be a tongue-in-cheek spoof of the gullibility of the public and the crass commercialism of the art world but only Banksy really knows. It does, however, provide a fast-paced and highly entertaining glimpse into a world that has, heretofore, eluded the camera because of its secretive nature and dubious legality.

I'd heard of the film but must admit to watching it with no expectation whatsoever, so there's no point in me saying I wasn't disappointed as I had no expectation BUT I was immediately enchanted and absolutely hypnotised by this fantastic tale that weaves fact with fiction.

Banksy blurred and blacked-out next to a monkey head with no eyes under glass...superb! A yuppie pop attack that given half a chance a yuppie would probably buy as art or media...AND then Banksy's effected voice...oh my giddy aunt...I almost poohed my pants with laughter...AND WHAT DOES HE DO? He proceeds to play slightly dumb and remote allowing those that he is having a poke at to continue BEING dumb and remote. You, Banksy mate (not that it matters to you) gained my respect straight away! HERE is a genuine film that IS 'STREET ART'.

But the real star of the piece --- as created by Banksy --- is Thierry Guetta...F**king Genius! A superb caricature for the modern age...not only is he a Warhol baby BUT he seems to be the actual mistake that Warhol made during a dodgy can of soup in HIS fifteen minutes of madness! If he's really like he is portrayed then he's a passionate groupie at best without any artistic ability whatsoever...unless art has become project management (...AND to be honest I'm not sure whether Banksy is really making THAT point BUT hey I'm one measly member of the stupid masses...) Hell, it doesn't matter as Guetta does a good deal of his talking whilst overlooked by a portrait of the Laughing Cavalier...whose heady hairstyles he seems to emulate...so consciously or subconsciously he is laughing at us whilst laughing at the character he creates...everything is so manufactured that it is almost stencilled in a way that STREET ART never was BUT in a way that the mass market bullsh*t IS! What can I say but this is a portrayal of a distorted art market and the plain meaninglessness of pop-art? Now that everyone can have their fifteen minutes of fame I guess the thing to de-construct is fame itself...and that's what Banksy does here...and has been doing since he marked his first wall...I could go on but it'd waste your time with my idiocy and isn't that what this film is about?! Take a leaf out of Banksy's Beckett-like debut (not only has he Waited for Godot HE stencilled him)--- Think for yourself and create your own reality! 

Definite must watch for everyone in my opinion.

This is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the better. Directed by the mysterious street artist Banksy, the ostensible story follows a French immigrant to Los Angeles named Thierry Guetta who made his living operating a second hand clothing shop.

As a hobby, Guetta began videotaping the nighttime antics of various local street artists like Shepard Fairey (who created the famous HOPE poster of Barack Obama) as they plastered their guerrilla art on empty billboards, highway overpasses and the blank sides of buildings often times just a few steps ahead of the vigilant, but unappreciative L.A. police department.

Virtually any street artist who was anyone, including the elusive Banksy, sooner or later got videotaped by Guetta, which led to hundreds of hours of raw footage being stored in unmarked boxes that no one would ever see. 

Like a collection of dictionaries on a shelf, while they may have all the words necessary to tell a great story, until someone did the actual work of putting them into a coherent order, there would be no way to separate the signal from the noise.

Several attempts to bring order to this chaos were less than successful, finally, Thierry Guetta got tired of just documenting these street artists, hey, if they could be artists by just doing it, so could he. So, blatantly stealing these street artists style, methods and madness, Thierry Guetta declared himself an artist and began to create work on his own. 

Yes, just like that.

Exit Through The Gift Shop finally takes us to the madcap opening of Thierry Guetta's first one-man show in a gallery created from an unused TV Studio. It is a huge success and becomes the "happening" place to be seen for a while. In fact, Thierry Guetta has probably made more money and generated more press than some of the street artists he used to film and who are still on the streets as it were, much to their annoyance.

Exit Through The Gift Shop is a thrilling and original film that grabs you from the first and won't let go; the only problem with all of this is it may just be a prank. 

The clues to that are the fact that Banksy, the nominal director is a notorious prankster and not too many people seemed to have heard about this Thierry Guetta until this film was made. 

One other thing, actor Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Greenberg, Pirate Radio) provides the narration for the film and unless I am very mistaken, also seems to be the disguised voice of Banksy, who we see interviewed in heavy silhouette to hide his face. It also seems odd that all of this could have been happening in the very public L.A. art community without more people on the outside hearing about it. 

Either way, this is a fast paced and exciting film that will tickle you, astound you and fascinate you, even if you know nothing about street art. Which makes Exit Through The Gift Shop either the most believable mockumentary in film history, or the most disingenuous documentary. 

Exit Through The Gift Shop celebrates the subversive excitement many artists feel as they skewer the pieties of the pop culture that spawned them and not so subtly reminds us that on occasion, even the tamest of artists will bite the hand that feeds them. Don't miss it.

Like the very nature of the underground street art movement "Exit Through the Gift Shop" feels fresh and almost subversive. It doesn't matter to me if it is a conceptualized mockumentary, or a genuine attempt to record the outsider reality experienced by brilliant street artists like Shepard Fairey, Invader, and the infamous Banksy. "Exit Through The Gift Shop" is mischievous and immediate in the same way that street art is.

Mainly we watch the evolution of Thierry Guetta from an obsessive-compulsive videographer to a successful popular artist whose street credibility is quickly parlayed into the show of shows. Guetta takes contemporary icons and gives them Warholian emphasis, so we see a reinvention of Madonna, who once reinvented herself in a Marilyn-like way, and who we later learn commissions Mister Brainwash (Guetta) to design her cover art. Guetta's point-of-view is absolutely authentic in the way it synthesizes and skewers popular culture. Or is it Banksy's point-of-view? It doesn't matter. It's brilliant, provocative, charming, and completely entertaining.

There are many who will swear this film is 100% truth. However, there are also those who believe it to be a complete farce- concocted by Shepard Fairy (the Obama poster guy) and everyone's favorite guerilla stenciler, Banksy. Regardless of the film's true history, it is a statement about street art and, more importantly, an examination of the true values which motivate it. The film opens in 1999 with Thierry Guetta, a clothing mogul and amateur filmmaker. Guetta is a bumbling, stumbling and nearly incoherent Frenchman who accidentally discovers his cousin's role in the rapidly growing street art community. This chance occurrence sends Guetta on a 10 year, global journey to document prominent members of the fledgling art movement- from its grimy, urban roots on street corners and the sides of buildings, to its rise into galleries, auction houses and the homes of wealthy collectors. The odd, quirky and moving art in the film plays as much of a role as Guetta, Banksy and the other artists. Guetta represents the unknowing public who is forced to view this street art created by individuals who are fueled by cynicism and disgust for the modern, commercial and censored world we live in. And, naturally, he wants to be a part of it. Without giving too much away, 'Exit through the Gift Shop' is first an intimate look into the world of street art and how mainstream consumerism is destroying it- the same way it did coffee houses, acoustic music, and, well, art in general. And then it is one man's odyssey into the street art world. He is overcome by one of the last great outlets of independent social criticism and some of the movement's greatest contributors. Then, he attempts to become one of them and really makes a mess. 'Exit through the Gift Shop' is a documentary in the way that 'Borat' was a documentary. It's farce which forces its viewers to look deeper into the subject. Rhys Ifan provides narration for the film, which only adds to the humor and overall dry wit. In a perfect synthesis, 'Exit' combines great art, a few nail biting and anxiety inducing moments and a clever and hilarious story which is both too far-fetched to be fully believable but also simply be written off as a complete hoax.

First of all we have to make clear that this film is not about Banksy (although it contains some very rare and interesting footage of him "working"). Better than that this film is MADE BY Banksy himself! So be prepared for something really fresh. Second of all, this film is not even about street artists in general. It's about a man that tried too hard to be one. So be prepared for something entertaining. Best of all, this particular "artist" is actually an idiot so be prepared for something funny as hell. This movie is following a guy who accidentally got himself into the world of street art, not as an artist (he can't even draw a single line), but as a watcher. During the finale you will find out how an outsider moron, without working at all, can be a well known artist pissing all over the street art. I don't know if this is a vendetta for Banksy or he was just wanted to restore street art's "honor" from guys like Mr BrainWash (my God...). All I know is that I'm thinking this movie over and over for the past three days and being an "artist"(I hate the term ...whatever) myself, I can't forget the moment, laughing about this Terry guy when I realized that I'm actually laughing about myself. If you like Art and if you like Movies, this one is both.

This is a pointless and irritating mockumentary about nothing. All revolves around the most annoying, pretentious, vacuous French men in the world; a talentless guy with a grating accent doing nothing and talking forever without saying anything at all.

Yes, I do get the satire on the world of contemporary art, but the 10 final minutes are more than enough (and I wish they were a bit meaner) and the previous 70 minutes are just very, very boring.

Bansky's art is often great, but he should really stick to his guns and remain completely anonymous and invisible. If this movie shows his real personality he is just another snob East London twit

Thierry Guetta runs a vintage clothing shop in Los Angeles and is obsessed with photographing everything he sees. When he visits his native country, France, and finds a cousin who is a street artist named Invader, his blood takes him on a tour where he meets other unorthodox graffiti painters on their controversial rounds, mostly at night, in order to avoid the law.

Guetta meets the most notorious guerrilla artist of them all, a Brit who uses the name Banksy. They become good friends and the underground Englishman has managed to keep is identity a secret, even after becoming a financial success. So far, so good. The problem comes up when Guetta starts painting and somehow, with no apparent talent, becomes the toast of the Los Angeles art community with a show, followed by fame and fortune. The man is an insufferable ass****. By the end of the documentary, I hated the guy. Stay away from this pretentious bull****.

I knew nothing of this film. When I received a email from the Sundance Institute. Stating a surprise Documentary to be screened at Sundance. I jumped at the opportunity. And what I discovered was brilliant.

Sundance announced the surprise documentary was to be "Exit through the gift shop". Now I still knew nothing at this point. Then I overheard many conversations about this Bansky fellow. So, I felt the need to find out a bit. Not too much. Wanted to go into this feeling surprised. And I was.

The documentary starts off with Terry Guetta a France native living in L.A. Terry filmed everything. I mean everything. Then on a trip back to France he followed his cousin "Invader" a well known street artist. Terry found the rush of street art addicting. So, once back in L.A. Terry filmed another famous street artist Shepard Fairey. Now Terry was now looking to film the greatest street artist ever. Banksy! After Banksy and Terry finally met. Their friendship blossomed. Allowing Terry to film the mysterious Banksy. As the film progresses Terry's film making subsides. And he has the "Bug" to become a street artist himself. Now as Banksy turns the camera on Terry. The film changes direction and reveals some interesting facts and faults.

I will leave the storyline there. I wouldn't want to give away the whole documentary. The artwork and the story is engaging. The documentary is thought provoking and honest. A must see for all.

The infamously elusive street artist Banksy's directorial debut, Exit Through the Giftshop, has baffled critics once again after being nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Documentary category. Reviewers and moviegoers alike have been unsure about the film's authenticity; speculation over whether it's a hoax is rife. So have the Oscar judges been fooled?

Exit Through the Giftshop tells the story of Thierry Guetta, an eccentric French shopkeeper and amateur filmmaker in California who decides to film street artists at work. Some of the world's most famous street artists agree to participate, including Banksy, who, in the interest of preserving his closely guarded anonymity, demands to be blacked out in the footage.

But in reality, Guetta has no intention of editing his footage together into a documentary. Banksy realises this and halfway through the film he takes over. He decides to make his own movie about Thierry's project and convinces the Frenchman to become a street artist himself. Banksy teaches him all the tricks of the trade. Thierry ends up adopting the name MBW, an acronym for 'Mr Brainwash'.

Banksy is widely accepted to be the director of Exit Through the Giftshop, though he is not formally credited as such in the film. His point is to expose how empty and easy commercial street art has apparently become.

The film is effectively a joke on two counts. Firstly, it exposes 'the joke' that is contemporary street art, which, Banksy signals, has become so vacuous that anyone could do it. Second, by blurring the lines between fact and fiction and still presenting the whole thing as a documentary, Banksy has delivered a test for the art critics themselves, who have had to decide whether or not to call his bluff. 

As they are dared either to love it or hate it, Exit Through the Gift Shop has led to a chronic case of fence-sitting among reputable critics. This is for fear, not only of being exposed as not getting the joke, but also as not getting Banksy himself.

Commentators basically risk slotting themselves into one of two polarised camps. The accepting viewer becomes a clued-up subscriber of Banksy's trendy, but in my opinion arrogant, worldview. The rejecting viewer, however, is widely deemed to be an ignorant zombie, moving about the world without any care or understanding for the injustices Banksy purports to be exposing.

Whatever you make of Banksy's Big Messages (I'm not a fan), Exit Through the Gift Shop is indeed a captivating story. Yet it seems the Oscar jury has tried to put itself in the cool, Banksy-fan camp just by nominating the film, which doesn't strictly qualify as a documentary. Or does it?

Regardless, there is clearly a message here. So let's go back to the film to see what it's all about.

The underground world of graffiti artists is opened up to us through Thierry Guetta's befriending of street artists who accept him into 'the movement'. One, Shepard Fairey, says of street art that 'the more important it seems the more people wanna know what it isand it gains real power from perceived power'.

So the aim is to get people noticing, wondering about and discussing your graffiti. The more you see an image repeated across a city, the logic goes, the more valid it will seem. Just think of the rats that Banksy has spraypainted around London as a reminder that we're all apparently slaves to the rat race.

Such repeated 'tags' become trademark symbols, serving to legitimise a street artist as a notable presence in a city landscape. But what does it say of the art itself if it needs to be judged simply by how much it is being talked about, and if the way to achieve this is by being repeated ad nauseum? In fact, Banksy's joke about modern art's (ir)relevance is answered in the film by proclaiming that it derives its legitimacy from recognition.

Banksy, the most prolific and well-known artist of the movement that Thierry Guetta sets out to document, has built a successful career in providing new icons and narratives for artists to discuss. His graffiti has attempted to rewrite the presumptions of the galleries and dealers who make up the art establishment. And as a social commentator, Banksy has sought to rewrite the story of how we view everything from the surveillance society and consumerism to the Israel-Palestine conflict. His insistence on anonymity is meant to help signal that this alternative narrative that he tries to promote is all around us if you just look hard enough because he supposedly exposes a deeper truth.

When put into the context of Banksy's wider work and graffiti activism, it becomes clear that Exit Through The Gift Shop is also an attempt to rewrite the story of 'the movement'. If he who makes the recognisable icons also truly has the power to set the agenda, then the temptation to play a trick on the cultural establishment  and maybe embarrass his critics in the process - was too strong for Banksy to resist.

As for whether or not the film is a good documentary, the pedants who want to disqualify it from the Oscar race miss the point. All documentaries are scripted movies and playing with the truth has more and more become part of the documentary filmmaker's remit, as, for instance, Catfish has shown.

When The Cove won the Oscar for Best Documentary last year, it was not due to being a high-quality film. Instead it was The Message wot won it. Likewise, if Exit Through The Gift Shop wins this year, it will say more about the jury's social leanings than about the film's cinematic worth.

Wow, what a great documentary. Having said that, hilarious, disturbing, brilliant, where to begin with this one? The story of street art which took a serious turn from straight up graffiti somewhere along the way to becoming the new hottest thing, but this story has a twist.

The John Belushi looking Thierry who is crazy, and was obsessed with filming street artists, having fooled many to believe he was a documentary filmmaker, when in reality he was just a French guy with a camera. Became obsessed with meeting the brilliant, elusive street artist Banksy and one day does. Banksy, who is everything Thierry is not, being humble, low key, a true artist, not looking for fame. Imagine that? Actually attempting to avoid the spotlight. Or is Banksy not what you would think and just brilliant at creating a mystique, like Batman who everyone wants to know his true identity, who doesn't want recognition and operates at night in the cover of darkness in order to create that scarcity many artists desire in order to sell for more money? that is up to you to decide. I feel that Banksy is the real deal, a true artist, not in it for the money and a true genius.

Banksy, who is the Michael Jordan of street artists encountered Theirry In L.A. and warmed up to him after he took a metaphorical bullet for him at Disneyland in a hilarious post 9/11 scare, encouraged Thierry to go back to L.A. and put on a show after he realized the horror that was his attempt at a documentary film. With Banksy's endorsement, Thierry became a million dollar art seller on his first show.

This film is as much a commentary on the creative movement of street art as it is the death of the movement. Innovators come along, do something new, than it becomes mainstream because some hack imitates the originators and sucks all the air out of the movement. Same old story...

I've never seen a movie detail in a clearer way the difference between art and imitation. This film is a pitch perfect example of how general public ignorance kills real art and replaces it with cheap copies of itself. -particularly ironic for street artists, whose entire medium is based on making cheap copies. 

How banksy could make this all so completely lucid and simple, how he begins by turning a documentary that was suppose to be about him on the amateur documentarian himself, seems a working example of the principles of street art  looking at wasted urban environments as a launching pad for art is just like looking at neglected urban people as the most interesting place for a story to begin. 

And what a story. This is better than fiction: the film takes you from the documentarian's compulsion with filming everyone and everything, a seemingly pure pleasure, to his compulsion and luck with filming street artists. It makes you truly love him for his irrational passion in his new subjects and their growing trust in him as the only true documentarian of their work. Then it shows how this same passion drives him towards becoming a street artist himself. It seems a perfect fit - you don't need a pedigree - just passion. But he capitalizes on it, copying not only the work, but the hype machine that propelled Banksy, Obey and all others, until he's essentially a kind of grotesque gambler - a monster imitator desiring to now replicate and beat the art and artists he once loved innocently capturing. The public is none the wiser. They mistake his work for that of his influences. His style for that of those he ripped off.

In focusing on the little person and watching him grow into a monster imitator, a malignant force that capsizes the movement - you see how hype, press and capitalism corrupt passion, or are the logical extreme of it: passion taken to its final conclusion when left unchecked. You see how love for art is based on desire: a need to hold onto something so tightly you become it, how idolizing someone is one step away from tearing him down to replace him with your own untrained, envious persona. 

By the end, Banksy's need to remain anonymous, his FBI styled black face, voice altered interview, takes on a much different meaning. It's not just to avoid recrimination for his illegal art, it's to avoid self-hype, celebrity, corrupting greed - the very kind that his imitator revels in. It's to make art with no drive to exploit himself, to keep it coming from an honest place, the only place it should come from, whether the public can tell the difference or not. 

His final thoughts on the man who imitates him, while negative, don't feel biased, even given Banksy's somewhat losing role in their relationship. He was never in the public hype game to begin with, not as a recognizable human being, so from the very start, he avoided the final weakness that all rising artists - real or imitators - succumb to: the reproduction and sale of their own image.

How is it until now I'd never seen this gem of a movie? The film is directed by notorious, and equally mysterious English street artist, Banksy. It uses many, many pieces of stock footage from a French shop keeper named Thierry Guetta (A man who would later be known as Mr. Brainwash), who follows many street artists all over the world, capturing their art on film before it is taken down. He soon comes across the man himself, capturing his art, and even attempts to make a documentary centered around the art, and the artists (Even though he has never made a film before). But Banksy decides to turn the tables, and instead focuses his own documentary on the life of Guetta. Why? As Banksy himself puts it, "He's a more interesting person than I am." An inspired decision on his part. Theirry Guetta really is a fascinating person, a man obsessed with taking a video camera everywhere he goes, and capturing these artists at work, having strong senses of passion for both. He is also a witty person, sometimes the things he says feel a little too odd to be true, but believe it. The film's portrait of the man is rather eccentric, and energetic.

A lot of this is to the credit of film editors Tom Fulford, and Chris King, whose editing and pacing is pitch perfect, always leaving proper delivery for some rather humorous things to occur, and never straying away from giving the world of art its own adequate time in the spotlight. The film really is a thought provoker, sometimes the life of the man can make you question "Is this for real?" I guess the whole film is really summed up by one phrase: "Time will tell whether I'm a rabbit, or a turtle." Sounds silly now, but once you hear it, the gears in your head start right up. It's a passionately crafted movie of a man with nothing but passion for what he does.

Exit Through the Gift Shop is a diamond in the rough, one that I give **** out of ****

I don't know if there is any definitive proof out there to suggest that this in fact a "mockumentary" or a "prankumentary", or whatever else it has been coined by critics for that matter - but - hoax or not, I thought it was well worth the watch! I personally believe it is fake. Straight from the off I began to to question aspects of the story; the validity of the storyline, the authenticity of the characters, and in particular, who was doing the filming when it was the film-maker in shot!? Anyway, that aside, Banksy does make a pretty convincing movie, and after surfing the web for just a few minutes, my findings have proved that many (dupes?) still firmly believe the material is 100% authentic.

For me, this takes little away from my enjoyment in watching the film. Towards the end, I did feel a little cheated, as documentaries have traditionally been based on reality, and therefore a non fiction documentary does seem a little pointless. But like I said before, it is still worth watching.

Admiring the many pieces of street art, alone, make the film worth a watch for me. Don't expect to be blown away, because this after all is just a documentary, (and lets face it, no documentaries are that exciting!) but it certainly does enough to maintain my interest throughout.

I doubt this is ever going to exist as somebody's 'favourite movie ever', I think I can say that with conviction, however, it is one of those films that I recommend you watch - If only once.

First of all, a misconception has been clarified, it's a documentary made by Banksy instead of a documentary about Banksy, the protagonist is a French guy lived in USA, named Thierry Guetta, who is a fanatical street art lover and amateur filmmaker, later he dubs himself as "Mr. Brainwash", when he engages himself into his own path as an artist, and eventually he succeeded in turning his debut solo exhibition as an unforeseen knockout.

Conspicuously I am not such a documentary enthusiast, the last-seen documentary I could recall is Werner Herzog's ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2007). And the single reason why I feel compulsive to watch this film is BANKSY, then, due to the opening statement, it is a nonevent for me. But the film has its very rational depiction of the current ill-directed contemporary art market where self-seeking and over-hyped works are dominating, which are strangling the creativity of aesthetics for a booming generation, with which is the noblest and the most quintessential liability endows every qualified artist.

Whether or not the entire sensation is a hoax, the film has cunningly skipped most of Mr. Brainwash's activity concerning doing art, there comes a staggering shock all of a sudden he has created so many paintings and other art works, while we have not been witnessed anything about how these astronomical farragoes being produced, which I consider a big loophole here, or maybe it is a planned maneuver, only it boomerangs. 

Thierry's broken English is another nuisance for me, most of his interviews are badly written and don't contain any substantial meaning, even no wisecracks, and the film has wasted too much screen time on him rather than on his and other graffiti artists' works, and what's more vexing, he is not an even interesting character! 

After all, I tend to believe it is another prank Banksy has brewed, to expose the shallowness and aimlessness of the sickeningly frivolous art world we are trapped in.

Widely speculated to be an elaborate prank by the world's foremost "street" artists, Banksy, this ultimately engaging film examines the line between artistry, con artistry and commerce. The movie plays like a reality TV show with footage shot by Frenchman (although the silliness of his accent makes one wonder) Thierry Guetta interspersed with confessional interviews with the principals including Banksy, well-known since the Obama election Shepard Fairey and Guetta himself. Ultimately, Guetta dominates the story but it is the Banksy interviews which serve as the prime entertainment in the film. Banksy's Geico Gekko accent, Sahara-dry wit ("so I realized Thierry wasn't a documentary filmmaker but just a man with mental problems...and a camera") leave the impression of someone who could fake an entire documentary for fun and profit. However, Guetta may be the puppet master given that he cons Banksy, Fairey and "Space Invader", another Frenchman, into teaching him the trade, rips off their work and ultimately bamboozles the world's art-buying public into forking over several million dollars for crap he created on the fly (to which Banksy deadpans: "I use to encourage everyone I met to create art, I don't do that so much anymore"). Fans of "The Usual Suspects", "Basic Instinct" or just of ambiguity generally will appreciate the film and puzzling over what differentiates art from grift, con from sucker and selling out from keeping it real.

A key insight for me is what I amusingly call Ted's law. In this, when we layer abstractions in art, the "distance" between layers is equal. This is a great example.

The idea builds on the notion that humans alone are capable of seeing themselves in the world as they see the world. It is how we define consciousness.

Shakespeare started the notion of folding in art, where we add another layer: we have us as audience, a state both we and the play (in this case the play) acknowledge. In the play, we have people in the same state, an audience of sorts for the world of the movie. Since Shakespeare, we elaborate these folds because of the greater narrative palette it affords, but the basic dynamics are analogic layers, folds.

Ted's law holds that the relationship of abstraction established between the audience and the play is the same as that between the audience and the play (or whatever) within.

Banksy is an artist who works with this idea. His art almost always consists of two elements. One is chaotic, sloppy, copying (or adopting existing) graffiti, the vandalism sort. Superimposed on that is an observer rendered in a different style. These are made from stencils but originate in and reference photographs. These are on the street, so an observer can see the people looking at the art, the character within the art, and some random "art" designated from previously would have been equivalent to trash.

Frankly, this is a trivial idea because it is "small art." Small art is art designed to be consumed in the moment between the flipping of pages in a magazine, or during commercials. It has to be attractive and easy to "read." On reflection, it has to have a simple explanation. Part of this is the supposition that it is art of the people, real, visceral art. For me, it is background noise. It cannot help me, shape me or destroy me. That's a job for big, long form art.

Okay, now the film. 

The idea is the same: we have the street art. We add another layer: the story of the artists. We add yet another layer, the story of the filmmaker covering the story of the artists, making the "observer art" that is superimposed on graffiti, which in turn is linked to us as passers by. I do not suppose that this was designed by Banksy as a project beforehand, because that assumes less spontaneity than he advertises. I suppose instead that the story is much as it is presented: he fell into an opportunity and exploited it in the way he works.

The thing that has captured the imagination of the film public (and the Academy) is the tantalizing prospect that some part is a hoax. This clearly is engineered, because a similar joke is behind his street art. But even that is small art.

Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

The first half of the movie was good, except for the infinite unnecessary appearances and interviews of the camera d-bag -Mr. Brainwash- instead of the real artists... When I said good I meant it could've been a very engaging documentary, the topic is interesting, they got rare footage, exclusive interviews with the artists.... the second half makes me see, he wasn't an annoying french with good intentions, he was just an artist/rock star/d-bag wanna be... not much to say actually, should you watch this documentary? yes, it's a pop culture thing if you like to stay in touch with the world! should you watch every minute(even the boring bragging of the french spoiled kid) Nah, just ignore him, skip the boring parts and you will have a not so bad time.

Mr. Brainwash: "Common guys lets the show go on, f**k... okay, okay, there is one thing, one thing... starting now dis second I'm running the show!you not giving order to anybody right now, I'm running the show! you listen to mi, anybody is listening to mi now!"

Banksy directs a documentary about Thierry Guetta who immigrated from France in 1999. He opened a trendy vintage clothing shop in L.A. He is constantly filming with his video camera. He discovers his cousin is street artist Space Invader which turns into a more in-depth obsession with other street artists. Invader connects him with Shepard Fairey which leads to other artists. He gets intrigued with the secretive Banksy. He films Banksy and then Banksy turns the camera on him.

There is a fun energy about this. It feels guerrilla secretive outsider work. Then the question becomes whether this is real or fake or semi-real. It colors the movie for me. In the end, this is another form of street art. It doesn't have to follow any demands of a documentary. I took the whole movie with a grain of salt. It doesn't mean it's bad. I just wish this is a more definitive solid movie about Banksy.

Are the things around you real? Are they really what they seem? These questions are not entirely new, and usually the movies that pretend to answer them feature people in leather and latex and bullet dodging. But can you recall a single documentary that makes you ask the same questions without even actually trying to do it? I certainly don't. And this is just one of the things that Exit Through the Gift Shop does in a fresh and innovative way.

It's actually hard to describe what this film is without being either banal or cryptic. On the surface, this is a documentary about street art, people who do it and a particular person with a camera, who started as just a spectator from aside and ended up an overnight sensation in the art world himself.

But again, that's just the surface, and is everything what it seems? May it be a contrived attempt to show the true nature of modern art, a brilliant satire about the "true" value of it and a clear demonstration that in today's postmodernist world the only things that matter are promotion and hype?

Anyway, no matter if this film is a true chronicle of the street art and the people who make it or some sort of mockumentary prank made by Banksy to promote himself or have a laugh at the whole world for our own money, it's still a very thought provoking film and a great opportunity to see street art beyond simple graffiti. At least i finally got to see some of Banksy's works, and i have to admit that what he and some other guys do is far from plain vandalism authorities try to make it look like.

Still, Exit Through the Gift Shop is about more than just the counterculture art. It's also about the contemporary art as a whole, about the way it's perceived by people and what makes the difference between art and kitschy rubbish. This topic had already been raised before, but what makes this film unique is that it's not a fiction, and those guys who took some retard's sick fantasies at face value were not hired actors but regular people. And no matter if Banksy is an authentic artist or a project aimed at monetary gain, it takes a degree of brilliance to show so clearly in what screwed up world we're living today.
