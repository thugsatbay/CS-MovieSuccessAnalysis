### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Revolutionary Road is a drama centered around an unhappy married couple living in the 1950's suburbs. They struggle dealing with their lives, how things have turned out, and what to do next. April (Kate Winslet) is a stay at home mother and wife, who seems to want more than that. She had dreams of becoming an actress but it never seemed to work out. She's angry, depressed and really cold at times. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) works in the city, is unhappy with his job and bored with his life. He's just one of those guys that works because he has to. He needs to support his family, even if he hates doing it. Inner demons and problems of his own trouble him as he tries to live out his life. These character have problems and issues just like everyone else. Sometimes they may come off as selfish, cold, or confusing to us. Things haven't worked out, and they're upset. That's whats so interesting about this, you may have friends or neighbors in relationships like this, that would never think of. Everything seems great on the outside, but behind closed doors, it's a different story. We all have had things not go our way from time to time, but it's up to us to make the best from it and move on. April and Frank have a harder time with this. Fair, or not, they are unhappy. You may not necessarily relate to the characters yourself, but you can respect that their are people like this all the time, in everyday life still, that have problems they go through. They may not be as drastic as these problems, but everyone has something not right with them. There are many themes in this film, mainly being love, marriage, relationships, and life.

DiCaprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. They really have a great chemistry together and seem to build off each other. Relationships are complicated and the highs and the lows are really shown extensively. All around great and believable performances with a small role by Michael Shannon, who shines as the crazy guy who tells it how it is. This is a film that will probably be best known for it's acting performances.

The film is directed by Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty. The film, itself is visually and artistically amazing. The lighting, colors, sets, scenes, costumes, everything is extremely well done. It's beautiful. I loved the cinematography. 

I can definitely can understand the hate, or dislike for this film. Due to it's depressing subject matter, it's not really a film you can sit down and just flat out enjoy or be entertained that much from. It's not a film for everyone. If you are just looking to be entertained and have a good time seeing a film, I don't think I would recommend this. It's shows the stark brutal reality of an unhappy suburban couple. If your looking for a film that more than that, one that is filled with terrific performances, great cinematography and direction, then you should check this out sometime. It's a really well made film all around, but be warned, it may be a hard one to enjoy.

Love, it's a curious thing. When it's fresh it is new, it is exciting and you wake up every morning just aching to spend another day with the person you love. Then you get married, have kids perhaps and things change. You fight. You fight over NOTHING. You grow to loathe the person you used to love to wake up next to. The world closes in on you and things don't seem the same anymore. You daydream about what life used to be like, how much love you used to be in and ask yourself - what happened??? Frank and April Wheeler meet and fall in love at a party. They talk about how their lives are going to be extraordinary and they are going to be different. They are going to live in Paris. They are never going to be "those people" in the suburbs. That isn't what life has in store for them. However life happens, April gets pregnant and they have to settle for a life more ordinary than they had planned for with the promise that someday, they will return to their dreams and complete them.

The Wheeler's dreams do not ever become reality and as the bleak expanse of life stretches out ahead of April she decides to reach out for her personal brass ring and convince Frank that they are better than their home on Revolutionary Road and Frank's job with his father's company and are meant for the greatness that they once talked about having in Paris. April quickly begins to hope again that not only will her life change to what it should have been but that her and Frank will fall back in love again. Frank falls in love with the idea and agrees to go, but has reservations about leaving the job he hates but that gives him a purpose in life. The plans are only a temporary band-aid as their glass house of dreams tumble around them and become a shattered illusion of what it used to be.

This movie is not one that you will send your entire family to see - or even your good friends. It isn't one that everyone will get or even WANT to get. However, this movie will tear out the heart of the people that have been in a relationship that has gone sour and were powerless to stop it. You try everything to stop the inevitable train wreck you see coming but yet, it still ends in a fiery crash and you stand and wonder how your life could end up this way. That's Frank and April and you will come to love and hate them by the end of this movie.

The acting in this movie is beyond amazing because it's simple and not overdone by the lead actors. Many things are not ever said - nor needed to be said - and were played with a flick of emotion across the face. I watched this movie expecting Kate to be the one to blow me away as usual and was shocked when it was Leo that knocked my socks off. I felt little sympathy for Frank in the novel but in the movie he plays him so well you can't help but feel sorry for him. I must mention that the supporting roles in this movie are nothing to sneeze at as well.

If you are looking for a wholesome family movie that will melt your heart, this isn't it. However, if you are willing to deal with a bit of stark reality - this is the movie for you. It rocked me harder than American Beauty ever did.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the incentive of my going to see this film, and I could not be more convinced of their talent than I am after the two-hour brilliance. 

This film is reality in its purest, yet magnificently artistic form Â– the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience, from the overture of an argument to its climax; the screaming, the furious need to verbally and physically harm, punch, kick, no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil, there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles, a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship. 

It is all a depiction of two genuine lives that have the potential of existing in complete harmony, yet cannot because of the stereotypical environment and situation they find themselves in. They both crave change, an alteration in their monotonous state of being, but because of the lengthy period of time that they have spent in such a circumstance, their mentality is differently modified. April (Kate Winslet) finds unreserved determination to leave to Paris and although her character seems at times erratic, we gradually come to understand that she is in fact the stronger personality of the two; she truly finds change favorable, whereas Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) seems to find the idea of change more flattering than change itself.

Each choice a person makes can change a life, and that life is not always theirs. This film shows us just how wrong something right can be, as well as how right something wrong can be.

So a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided to watch a movie and wanted to see Titanic again, so of course we get to the sad ending where Jack dies, but Rose lived on to have an incredible life, I asked my sister "I wonder what would've happened if Jack lived? Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have?", she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road, I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say, especially in 1997, thank God Jack died! OK, sorry for the lousy introduction, I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam Mendes(American Beauty) who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.

Frank and April Wheeler moved to Revolutionary Road in one of New York City's wealthy Connecticut suburbs, and have a daughter and a son in hopes of living the American dream. But April is dissatisfied with her life as a suburban housewife, and Frank despises his marketing job at Knox Business Machines, where his father worked for twenty years in a similar position. They feel that they are unique and special, but trapped in the conformity of life in the suburbs, where they moved to raise their children. On Frank's birthday April surprises him with a birthday cake and a proposal that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. Frank is reluctant at first but ultimately embraces the idea, and the renewed optimism breathes fresh life into their relationship. Meanwhile, April becomes pregnant again, she wants an abortion and has bought a device she has heard is safe if used in the first twelve weeks. Frank disapproves. Later, Frank is offered a promotion and raise at work. Eventually he tells April that for the sake of the unborn baby he has decided not to go to Paris. Extremely unhappy, April starts to go crazy and screams her hatred for Frank as he still tries to continue to make the "perfect and comfortable" life for her.

This movie was really amazing, it's one of the most over looked Oscar wise from 2008, both Kate and Leonardo pull in heart wrenching performances. The thing about their characters is that I saw so much of my parents in them, they had all these amazing dreams together, were so in love, but then discover that life jumps in the front seat to what they really wanted to do. Kate's character, April, is receiving a lot of hate, but honestly I couldn't hate her, how could you? Yes, she said some awful things, but when it came down to it, she just wanted the man she fell in love with back again, she wanted to feel alive. The problem was both her and Frank were trying to run away from their problems, then Frank got comfortable; honestly, who knows what would have fixed their problems? But I do recommend Revolutionary Road, I really thought it's a small masterpiece and will get more recognition in the future I hope.

Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.

This film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.

The film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.

Revolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year.

I saw an advance screening of Revolutionary Road in Beverly Hills, CA this evening (December 14th). A Q&A session followed the screening with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, and screenwriter Justin Haythe. Photos from the Q&A are attached to this report.

Revolutionary Road is a story that you won't be able to shake easily. The film will stick in your head and leave you to contemplate what has just happened on the screen before you. Richard Yates gives us the story of Frank and April Wheeler, the seemingly perfect suburbia couple. We soon find out their marriage is teetering on the edge of a collapse as they are overwhelmed by the fact that they have each made the wrong choices in their lives.

Once again Kate Winselt and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry, pulling the best out of each other. This is a heavy film with emotionally complex characters, I'm not sure I could think of any two actors that could pull off the roles of Frank and April Wheeler like Leonardo and Kate did.

"Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural." I'm not sure who said that, but it is a notion that sums up this film.

Michael Shannon shinned in his role as the clinically insane son of Kathy Bates character; John Givings. Bates and Shannon both deliver humorous scenes to this heavy storyline, although there are times when you see the sadness and desperation in their characters as well. Michael Shannon's character, John Givings, is the truth in this film. Although clinically insane, he can see through everyone's lies and does the unthinkable; he forces everyone face their own truth.

I guarantee you will not be singing "My Heart Will Go On" after seeing this film. But you won't be disappointed with this little film gem.

A show-stopping Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank Wheeler, with remarkable power and an insight we only get from the greatest kind of actors. Allowing the audience to become fully immersed in his psyche, letting us feel everything with him. Living his pain, resentment, and the smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of emotions in between. It is a highly accomplished piece of acting from the lead actor that I cannot imagine being ignored come this award season. Frank is a flawed man that many people will be able to see aspects of themselves in. Not being satisfied with marriage, family, work. Feeling we are meant or destined for something greater, yet paradoxically feeling the doubt and insecurity in ourselves to really go after it. He's depressed, has a past he can't seem to let go of, he's arrogant, he's a liar, he's manipulative and in many ways immature. Yet we know him. He's our father growing up, he's a brother, friend or possibly even you. He makes mistakes and is almost embarrassingly human. What I found ultimately tragic about him was not the way in which he lied to others but the way in which he lied to himself. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank. He was terrific in "Aviator" , "Blood Diamond", "This Boy's Life" and others and has rightfully earned his place as one of the finest actors of his generation. Having said that, this is a whole new layer to DiCaprio that none of us have seen before. He brings a new, mature type of authentic subtlety to his craft. He doesn't resort to any big physical transformation. It's all internal. This is a new height for him, and easily the greatest acting of his career. A performance of great emotional intensity and depth that I can say without hesitation, will be remembered for generations to come.

Kate Winslet plays April Wheeler with a sharp fervor. She is angry, depressed and intensely believes she and Frank are destined for something greater than a life of conformity in the burbs. She is a tragic character in that she is basically a closed book, she shuns the love that people try to give her, she is a free spirit and quite the handful. She comes up with an idea to break free of the conformity she shares with her husband in an attempt to revive their marriage and at first it seems to work - the passion for life and each other reignited. But after an unexpected event and other factors, will the dream plan go through?

The chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio in "Revolutionary Road" reminded me in many ways of the chemistry between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in the 1966 film "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". They create an intensity in their arguments that is electric and palpable. You cannot take your eyes off them, they glue you to the screen and stick it to each other as sharply as the couple from "Virginia Woolf" were able to. Frank and April's story is grounded in a greater, more painful reality, however. DiCaprio's raging sobs are chilling.

The film is very dark. And the honesty practically guts you in some cases, so I don't think everyone will love it. Watching it was emotionally draining. Sam Mendes certainly did his job well here. It's his greatest film since "American Beauty".

I went to see this at an advanced screener in Leicester Square last night. Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight. So, the book, 10/10, the film, 8/10.

Just saw this movie. All I can say is: Wow! In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera, we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler; a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet, who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling, memorable, emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet, which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be "in the moment". Additionally, there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates, whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son, who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel clichÃ©, but with everything else working so well, those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film, Winslet never disappoints, and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film. December 26th. Save the date!!!

"I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, just as our memory does. " Â– Jorge Luis Borges

Even though Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is set in the suburbs, the reality is, that it is set in a dream world, an illusion; The illusion of purpose, of ones place in society and of what we are 'supposed' to do. We are supposed to get married, we are supposed to have children, and we are supposed to move to the quite suburbs and raise a family. Why? Because that is what everyone does, what everyone has done, and is the ingrained belief that everyone will continue to follow; there is no other reason, it's the blind leading the blind. That is the message that perforates the film, and is the hell that consumes the lives of April and Frank Wheeler. Revolutionary Road is and intricate and intimate portrait of how the so called 'American Dream' is sometimes the 'American Nightmare'.

They were happy once. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) was fresh from the horror, but freedom of the war and April (Kate Winslet) has great aspirations of becoming an actress. Married and in love, the couple buy a modest but quaint house on Revolutionary Road. But nine years later, two children and two crushed ambitions later, the doldrums and encroaching insanity of suburban life consumes the Wheeler's. Frank has an affair with a new co-worker, at a job he cannot stand, and April plays the role of mother, jumping about a few tired stage plays in a desperate attempt to feel alive. Following an explosive confrontation, April pitches the idea that they simply up and leave for Paris, the place Frank (that he visited during the war) said is the only place he ever felt truly happy and vibrant. But an unexpected pregnancy and a new promotion at work stifle their globe trotting plan, and the two spiral into despair. 

Sam Mendes is no stranger when it comes to dealing with the pressures of suburban life, and as with his masterpiece American Beauty the simplicity of the narrative works to great effect. Unfortunately, there are a number of things that keep this film from reaching such heights, yet I assure you it is not the performances of the leads, with Winslet continuing her streak of stellar work and DiCaprio exploding onto the screen with some of his best work ever. Some of the supporting cast is less effective, such as a neighbour's son (Michael Shannon) who is given a reprieve from the mental institution where he stays. Visiting the Wheeler's he openly spouts profound insights into the horrors of conformity, and in turn, cranks up the subtlety of the films message to a sledgehammer across the face. I am not sure of this characters role in the novel, but I assume something was lost in translation. 

With the highs and lows of the relationship, Mendes seems to follow suit with the screenplay which is at times astoundingly emotional and disturbing, and at times ghostly and uninvolving. The characters themselves are not particularly likable, but the film is so haunting, especially when completely over, it is hard not to recommend. There is, however, a fine line between a film that is tragic and one that is depressing, and Mendes is very close to crossing the line. But so well shot, so well scripted and with such powerhouse performances, it is still a solid success. Kate Winslet's character once quips, "You never forget the truth, you just get better at lying." and with Revolutionary Road it is nothing but brutally honest, and is sure to have those people dreaming of that white picket fence and two car garage seriously re- examining their 'dream'.

Revolutionary Road has been adapted from the same named novel of Richard Yates. The setting is a suburban area on the east coast in the mid-1950s. Surely there have been many changes of values in gender, society, and family over the decades. Yet,Revolutionary Road, whether the film or the novel, has never lost its power of confronting us, people living in the globalized 21st century, with all the existential issues Â– questions about life. This is the only movie that I have ever seen which can pose philosophical questions directly yet without compromising the engaging power of drama to its audience. It throws at us with questions about the meaning of life, our responsibility to live an authentic life, our freedom to make choices and decisions, our desire to connect with others and maintain independence, the fine line between the sane and the insane, the limitations of life, etc. 

Apparently, April and Frank are diametrically opposite. April is revolutionary, striving for making changes and acting out her desires; Frank is reactionary, always playing safe and following paths opened by others. But, this is not true. Frank was ambitious before marriage. He conformed to the norm for a while, but deep down he felt regretful for the lost dream. Without that intrinsic desire, April would not be able to talk him into moving to Paris at all. (Again, Paris is just a symbol). What is less obvious but crucial for the development of the story is April's passiveness to life. All we see is she pushing Frank to live a life he wants. But what about her? What is her passion about life? We just vaguely know that she wants to be special and live an interesting life. But what exactly it is about? Acting, maybe. But she decided to quit after some setback. Instead of dealing with her own disappointment, fear, uncertainty towards her dream, she averts her frustration by imposing her dream on Frank, making him believe it and actualize it. In doing so, she saved herself from failure to achieve her dream. But, she forbore her responsibility to live a life she wants. In short, both April and Frank possess the same two conflicting dynamics in their minds. It is just that the director highlights the contrast between the pair in order to create a tug-of-war situation, which effectively generates a tension throughout the movie. It is very hard to side with either April or Frank because they were in one in the first place. Personally, half of me goes with April and half of me goes with Frank. 

Despite the fact that the story is thickly embedded with philosophical propositions, Revolutionary Road is still a very touching love story. From the moment April thrust her dream into Frank's hand, their love was doomed. Being disillusioned and feeling trapped in a life she hates, April became numb to life. There was no more love in her. As what she and Frank had said to their lunatic neighbor, life became empty and hopeless to April. That's how the love's gone. So was the unborn baby. So was April. A funny question arises from Frank's definition of insanity: according to Frank, insanity is the inability to communicate with another human being and inability to love. How many of us are totally sane then?

As always, DiCaprio's acting is wonderful. He is particularly convincing when getting across the vulnerability of Frank. Kate Winslet performs well. However, when I expected some liveliness in April at certain points in the movie, I did not see it. The dialogues and the cinematography are very clever and powerful. We as the audience might have left the theater with a lot of questions that we fear to answer. Just as likely, we might have walked away in reminiscene of our own struggles about living truthfully.

This is a dense movie and worth another viewing at least.

I just saw an advanced screening of this movie at the DGA theater by Carnegie Hall. Ever since I heard that DiCaprio and Winslet were teaming up again, I had to go see it. After waiting a half an hour outside of the theater in the freezing weather, I was thinking to myself, "this movie better be good".

I was not the slightest bit disappointed, and I was extremely happy walking out of that theater. If there is one person I must applaud, it's the casting director, because every person in that movie really got into character, and not one person was out of line. DiCaprio and Winslet's chemistry was once again flawless, I honestly felt like I was watching a 50's suburban couple fighting about normal, every day problems, no scripts. All of the supporting cast was superb, especially Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon, who should both be very tough contenders to beat for the best actress and best supporting actor Oscars, respectively.

Thank you, Sam Mendes, for giving the American people another great drama to watch, that really gave people a dose of what the "perfect 50's suburban life", was really like.

Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their "empty and hopeless" life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.

In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the "emptyness and hopelessness" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.

The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential.

Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring, pointless 2  hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think  many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about  the movie. I thought Winslet was okay, but seemed mannered and  annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like  a 15 year-old boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed,  again, far too young to be playing these characters. 
The film lacks story arc, structure, and most importantly...CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school (Mr.  Mendes) is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your  audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This  movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the  fight, however, because we don't know who the hell these people are. As  the movie progresses, we still don't see anything hint about who these  people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee, like we  never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then- nothing  happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and  DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1  reality show shot in 35mm. What's more, we don't feel or care about the  characters. When ever Winslet cried, I cringed. It's being touted as  one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered,  controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff.  And DiCaprio is just flat-out BAD. Perhaps I would think they did  better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise. 
On top of this, the film is morbidly predictable, and clichÃ©.  (SPOILER!) When Kate is "Upset" one morning, and having a fit in the  kitchen, Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's  pregnant, and having "Morning Cramps". And then of course, she says she  wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did.  Mendes, a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO  PERDITION, fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of  this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art  Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at  all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of  boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb  audiences go "Oooo, now that's a great camera angle." If this movie  gets nominations from the Oscars (which it will), I will know its  because those voters haven't seen the movie yet, and are voting for it  on name bases alone.

Having been a 50s housewife with children at home and a husband who wanted to be anywhere but there, this movie was familiar territory. How many of us in those years simply packed our dreams away for the immediate necessity of putting food on the table and paying the mortgage? Di Caprio is outstanding, as is Winslet, she having to deal with an American accent along with the tearing emotions. I didn't see that anyone picked up on the final scene, of Kathy Bates and her husband, but to me that was the whole moral of the story - here is where you will end up if you give in to what you know is not right for you. Overall, though, well done - except women in the 50s did NOT wear hats to work!!

The art of storytelling, whether in a play, a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters, their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism, such verisimilitude, there is nothing but parody, and the manipulation of stock figures.

I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions, but the characters were not believable, and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children, throw away place holders, so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family, and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.

A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters, or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line, you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met, and I met a few.

And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody, with no interest in his work, but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era, who had no idea what it did, or how it worked.

Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.

This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage, as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film "The Squid and the Whale" was about a dysfunctional marriage, where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art, while this was an exercise in a drama class.

For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s, believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era, try "Come back little Sheba" or "Death of a Salesman." Each of these films created actual characters, and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.

This film was about 2008, and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters, and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.

I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed, "American Beauty," one of my all time favorites.

Go figure!

I watched this with my wife after our local newspaper gave it their best rating. We knew from the storyline that it was not going to be a "feel good" movie. But I didn't realize it was going to be like watching paint dry.

First of all the movie has NO PLOT whatsoever. Nothing happens except shouting back and forth. The acting seemed very good. But as someone that doesn't know anything about the actor profession, I'd take a guess that this kind of acting... 2 hours of rage... would probably be the easiest. Just yelling and screaming as hard as you can, staring out the window, and tearing up. That's it! Aside from that, a few things happen in the movie that have no point whatsoever. What was the point of the office affair? Why spend 20 minutes on that and not have it go anywhere or mean anything? What about their friend's husband who professed love? What did it mean? Why? What was that point? What about the mentally challenged guy? Where did that come from, and how does that have anything to do with anything? I don't doubt that so many people enjoyed this movie. Everyone is different. But it leaves me confused on what it is that people saw so interesting in it. I feel like it was a 2 disc set and we forgot to play disc 2.

This was flat-out, out of the best movies I've ever seen. But I have been reading some comments about this movie and I want to clear some things up.

April is NOT selfish! She really loves Frank and would do anything to make him happy. She and him and both miserable in suburbia and she knows that Frank hates the job he works at. So she suggests that they go away. She only says Paris because she knows it's one of the only places he's ever been to that makes him feel "alive". She wants him to find a job that makes him happy. In fact, I firmly believe that if he told her he wanted to be a flamingo dancer, she would buy him the suit and let him do the can-can all over the house if it made him happy. 

When he accepts her offer to got to Paris, she feels that everything will be perfect. But then she hears him on the beach telling someone else about the job offer. She is crushed, not only because she was the last to know, but because it was like he was stomping on her dream of happiness for the family.

She decides then that she's done...that she just can't handle it anymore. She is tired of living a lie that she is happy when she knows full-well that she isn't. She loves him but frankly, marriage and kids is draining the life out of her. I think when she heard what she heard on the beach and Frank said, "Why don't you let that be my business," or whatever he said, he was basically telling her it was his life and to stay out of it. 

That's why the whole fight in the woods scene happened...she had made up her mind. She wanted out. You may not agree with her decision, but I can definitely understand it.

And Frank is not a bad man. Yes, I am aware that he cheated on April. But so did she. He's the type of man that needs to be loved and appreciated. I think he felt he wasn't getting that with April. He loves her and cares about her but she's a lot for him to handle. Especially in the opening scene when they get into a fight about the play. He can see that she is hurting that it bombed and he wants to make her feel better. But he doesn't know what to say and whatever he says, is wrong to April because she's already in a terrible mood. And you know men...they mean well but sometimes they are totally clueless. 

And he felt awful about cheating. Did you see the close-up when April and the kids sang happy birthday to him. He felt like the biggest jerk! 

The acting was amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was unbelievable as Frank. In the scene where April tells him she hates him and he cries, it ripped me apart inside. I don't know...something about men crying bothers me. Kate was wonderful as usual. I hope she wins that Oscar. The best thing about this movie was that DiCaprio and Winslet could speak volumes without saying a single word. It was all in their eyes. 

Sam Mendes is a genius! Anyway, I think I'm rambling now so I'll leave you to decide for yourself what you think of this movie. I, as you can see, fully enjoyed it.

I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I walked out of the theater following "Revolutionary Road." My expectations were lofty because I loved what Sam Mendes did with "American Beauty" (10/10) and I was intrigued by "Jarhead" (7/10) as well. Of course the preliminary bar was set high for a film featuring both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.

And yet, I was underwhelmed by the final product that was "Revolutionary Road." No, this wasn't a clichÃ©d case of setting the bar TOO high, because I always keep my pregame expectations in check. They're there, but I don't allow them to cloud my judgment.

Mendes was fine; his mise en scene was a bit mundane and predictable, yet still mostly effective. I would like to have searched for more subtlety when dealing with a director of Mendes' caliber, but it just wasn't there this time. Only shot that jumps out at me is the one of the sprinkler spout metaphorically separating April Wheeler from her family.

As for the performances, I felt that Winslet slightly outperformed Leo. Not that that's especially relevant, because neither performance was award-worthy. I'm shocked that Winslet could take home two Golden Globes in one year, when one of those Globes was awarded for her work in this film. She was good, but not outstanding.

I must tread carefully, though, because I shouldn't blame Winslet or DiCaprio for the shortcomings of the script. On the whole, the dialogue was absolutely painful -- nothing original came for seemingly endless sets of time. I'm aware that the screenplay was adapted from a novel, so perhaps the faults lie in the novel itself. Yet, that's not what I'm hearing from those who read and loved the book.

I was intrigued by the general concept of the film, because we all struggle with the internal conflict of our dreams vs. reality, and many of us struggle with the comfortable suburbia vs. monotonous suburbia conflict as well. But "Revolutionary Road" was overkill in both arenas. Just too much of the same throughout: calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion. Calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion.

Much of the repetition may have been intentional, but it simply wasn't effective. How Roger Ebert gave "Revolutionary Road" four stars out of four, absolutely boggles my mind.

This film is a 6/10, at best. If you love great cinema, you will be disappointed. "Revolutionary Road" is a level below.

Many people have said that Sam Mendes' latest forage into dark American suburbia in Revolutionary Road is how Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's characters from Titanic would be like had they have married in that film and Jack Dawson not met his effusive watery grave.

The film explores, from the very start, a broken relationship between the two brought on by banal life on the quiet Connecticut Revolutionary Road and both of them leaving behind the idealistic dreams of youth with DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler in an uninspiring sales job and Winslet's April Wheeler locked into the position of a housewife, briefly flirting with the world of theatre.

It is perhaps fitting that the opening scenes, culminating in a blazing row on an interstate roadside between the two, come after April feels she has failed in an amateur theatrical production. The movie feels like it has been adapted from a stage play rather than Richard Yates' novel with bulleted delineated locations and intense dialogue.

But it is the smouldering argumentative scenes between the Wheeler's that perhaps lead to a lack of fulfilment from the movie. While the feel is very Ingmar Bergman-esquire with gloomy and dark emotions bubbling under the surface, the movie does not portray the wider framework of the marriage strongly enough to carry these off.

The focal point of the film comes when April seizes on a former conversation between the two when Frank describes Paris in passionate terms, discussing his presence there in the World War II. In an attempt to reignite their lives, April suggests they set about moving to the European city so Frank can discover his true calling in life.

This provides an interesting pathway and allows the story to grow through the reactions of Frank's colleagues, a couple they're friends with, their former estate agent (Kathy Bates in her element as an interfering matriarch) and the Wheeler's two children.

It may come as a surprise that I had not referred to the children previously, especially as they fuel the destruction in Frank and April's marriage with Frank questioning whether April actually loves her children at all. The children themselves barely feature, merely used as plot tools to bring the narrative forward. This would not be such a problem but without any form of internal narration from either of them the sense of the true relationship between April and her kids is unclear and makes this aspect feel isolated.

The cold hard realities of the failing marriage are spotted by the estate agent's son, a mentally unstable man temporarily allowed out of an asylum, a notable performance from Michael Shannon, who frankly and with spite notices the hypocrisies and deterioration within the Wheelers romance.

The film uses set-pieces and the supporting cast to attempt to heighten the magnitude of admittedly bravely performed sequences between DiCaprio and Winslet, eventually reaching an engaging, though predictable, climax. While the movie is certainly not revolutionary in terms of its portrayal of a declining marriage (the television series Mad Men set in a similar suburban setting does this with much more care and intricacy), it is a solid piece of work from Mendes but cannot approach his seminal American Beauty. However, one is left longing for a greater insight into why and how the relationship has reached this point to provide much needed groundwork to the frequent marital disputes.

Frank and April Wheeler live in Revolutionary Road, a Connecticut suburb. April is a failed artist, and so lives at home taking care of her children. Frank is a businessman, and works at a dead end city job. Both are disillusioned, finding little substance in the daily grind of life.

From here on the film merely rehashes themes fully covered by Antonioni half a century ago. Frank and April see their dissatisfaction, firstly, as sexual unfulfillment, and secondly, as a product of their environment. In an attempt to find happiness, Frank thus has a meaningless affair with a young woman whilst April has sex with a friend and later a baby with her husband. But no, such fleeting moments of biological bliss cannot quench what is really an existential problem. And so when Frank and April decide to move to France, echoing the countless characters in Antonioni's filmography who run away, we know that the couple are merely pursuing an empty fantasy. Man's greatest flaw is his incessant belief that some external change can bring about an internal state of bliss.

The sickness that Frank and April feel was long diagnosed by Nietzsche, when he noted that western civilisation was fast moving in the direction of the Last Man, a listless creature with no great passion or commitment. Unable to dream, tired of life, he takes no risks, seeking only comfort, tolerance and security.

Today, First World countries find it increasingly difficult even to imagine a public or universal cause for which one would be ready to sacrifice one's life. Indeed, the split between First and Third World runs increasingly along the lines of an opposition between leading a long, satisfying life full of material and cultural wealth, and dedicating one's life to some transcendent cause. This is the antagonism between what Nietzsche called passive and active nihilism. We in the West are the Last Men, immersed in stupid daily pleasures whilst Eastern radicals are ready to risk everything, engaged in nihilistic struggle up to the point of self-destruction. What is gradually disappearing in this opposition between those who are "in", the Last Men who dwell in gated communities, and those who are "out", are the good old middle classes. The "middle class" is a luxury capitalism can no longer afford.

One of the successors of Antonioni's "malaise movies" is Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut", a film which expands on the post-modern malaise found in all those existential films of the past 2 decades (American Beauty, Fight Club, The Ice Storm, Blue Velvet, Safe, Fear and Loating, Being John Malkovich, Revolutionary Road, In the Bedroom, Little Children etc) by tackling the class and power relationships around its disillusioned couple. Though it also centres on a couple, one a failed artist (Alice) and the other a doctor (Bill), Kubrick's film probes beneath the fantasy image, giving his characters a context which these films typical lack.

On the surface, "Eyes" looks at the dark side of sexual liberation: the full commodification of sexuality, the sterility of a universe dominated by the superego order to enjoy, the collapse of religion and tradition, the worship of pleasure and youth and the prospect of a future totalised by scientific rationality and joylessness. In this world, love cannot flourish without sex; simultaneously, however, love is impossible because of sex. Sex, which proliferates as the epitome of late capitalism's dominance, has permanently stained human relationships. Sex is thus, as Derrida states, simultaneously the condition of the possibility and the impossibility of love. It is both nothing and everything.

But more importantly, "Eyes" is concerned with power, ownership and money and the way they connect with the issues of identity, intimacy and sexuality raised by films like "Revolutionary Road". Indeed, Bill's relationship with a mysterious power figure called Ziegler is at as pivotal in Kubrick's film as his relationship with his wife. Ziegler represents patriarchy, the symbolic order, yet he is also something of a Sadean libertine. He is both the Father who says No (guarantor of the symbolic order) and the Father who enjoys (wrecker of the symbolic).

You might thus say that films like "Revolutionary Road", which reduce their problems to domestic disputes, serve only to cut psychology loose from everything else. It's a type of hermetic, anti-social, ahistorical version of psychology, assuming that the whole cosmos is important only in relation to the conscious white male subject, which, incidentally, is exactly the sleepwalking egocentric complacency Bill begins "Eyes Wide Shut" so conspicuously cocooned in.

Few other films of the past decade (another is Lynch's Mulholland Dr) successfully attempt to open out domestic melodrama into the wider context of power, privilege, and patriarchy, and "Revolutionary Road" is no different, never developing beyond the complacent mindset of smugly moralising Hollywood liberalism.

Indeed, while Frank keeps his wife at home and out of a job, Bill wants nothing less than to block out female desire entirely. "Women aren't like that," he says, hence his attraction to prostitutes and masked women. As sex workers they resume the assigned place of women in his libidinal economy: they are passive recipients of male desire, not, as Alice has so terrifyingly revealed herself to be, agents of their own desire. And of course, it is the frightening realisation that he is himself an "object" exploited in another's "desire", that leads to Bill retreating to fantasy; fantasy being the very banal reality that Frank and April live in.

And so it is the flight into the ordinary, the domestic, the apparently well-constituted identity, that represents escape for The Last Man, but more importantly, it is power and capital, that (he believes) facilitates the actualisation of his dreams.

6/10 Â– Outdated 60's existentialism. Mendes strikes me as the new Anthony Minghella (both theatre directors). Mendes hides behind his cinematographers, and though his images are always clean and precisely composed, one senses no real visual imagination.

Sam Mendes who likes to accompany his movies with the simple yet soul-searching tunes of the piano by composer Thomas Newman has come up with another heavy emotional drama that brings out the best in each of the actors involved. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD givesÂ… the utopia 1950's suburbs its dark and hopeless mode, a trap of all things ordinary. It may not be a feel-good movie but it has a certain fine art to it.

I don't believe there's such thing as a perfect marriage but I've never seen such a dysfunctional marriage as messed up as portrayed in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD either. The story based on Richard Yates' novel is a bit twisted, in my humble opinion. Having said that, I think Sam Mendes does an magnificent job at directing, and just like American Beauty, he once again successfully uses the small spaces of the kitchen or the living room and turn them into a war zone or a battleground between a couple whose love for each other has grown cold. I'm not sure what attracts him to these kinds of stories and characters but it seems like Sam Mendes has found his specialty. Once again, Sam Mendes' go-to guy for original score and music selection, Thomas Newman doesn't disappoint, he picks the sound of the 50s that fit into every scene, emphasizing piano as the lead instrument, especially the silence between the notesÂ… capturing the state of mind of the characters when they re-think what just happened and think about what they're about to do.

Leonardo DiCaprio will floor you with his explosive, raw performance as Frank Wheeler, the husband who for some reason is too afraid to leave his comfort zone, he lets people's talk to mess with his judgment, he's too proud to make any drastic change. Kate Winslet who is attractive and marvelous in every movie she's in, radiates greatness as the wife, April Wheeler, who can't stand living an ordinary life anymore but is sick and tired of not being able to get Frank to buy into the idea of moving away for a better life in Paris. Frustrated and angry, she's a tough cookie that finally reaches her limits. Michael Shannon who plays John Givings, a man fresh out of the psychiatric hospital, does an excellent job as the unlikely voice of reason. In a mad, psychotic, unconventional way, he serves a harsh shrink to the couple who may not want to hear what he has to say but somehow they know that his opinions are true, his words are insensitive and hurt like hell but they're true, every single word. Shannon has always been good at playing a character who seems like he's lost a screw in his head, another actor I can think of who's also really good at that kind of role is Gary Oldman and young Jack Nicholson years ago.

This is not just a movie for married couple, this is for those who have the misunderstanding mentality saying that once you've settled down, that is it, You can only build your idea of happiness around that one enclosed environment and anything beyond that would be considered unrealistic and immature. This is a movie for those who are cowards and can't seem to take chances in life other than what's given to them in the most usual setting. This is a movie for those who have forgotten that being in relationship means being able to make big leaps with your loved one based on faith and love. You are not going to get mushy happy feeling after watching this movie, some of you might come out feeling a bit empty and depressed but I hope this story reminds you that your happiness is what you make of it, and not some norms that the world requires you to follow.

From beginning to end this movie was full of the following things: Smoking, Drinking, swearing, deception, depression, unhappiness, fighting, yelling, unfaithful sex, and hate. Then at the end the main female character gives herself an abortion in her own bathroom and dies. If your crazy enough to think this sounds appealing then this movie is for you, otherwise don't waste your time or give your money to this crap. I am amazed people actually enjoy this type of movie. The only good thing I took from this movie is how great my life actually is. This movie does remind me of why chasing worldly desires will lead to an unhappy life.

One of the reasons I keep devouring stories in general, and films in particular is that I firmly believe that the authors always have something to say, something worth being heard. A powerful message, if you may, about their view of life. A revelation to present the audience with, so we can leave the room with that "wow, life is just like that" feeling.

This message may be positive or negative, but it should always be believable within the reality of the film. I confess I rather prefer a positive one. Or, if negative, at least with a tiny bit of hope hidden somewhere, I rather not leave the room feeling miserable. But I understand some audiences may enjoy this and, in any case, it doesn't matter: it's your message, isn't it?

According to Justin Haythe (writer) and Sam Mendes (director), life is just too painful to be lived, too full of suffering and sorrow as to find the time to enjoy, create or love. We are hit with a most melodramatic picture of everyday events in a script that fails to create actual conflicts and believable drama. In such a farce, the luxury of the intense performances given by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are outrageously wasted.

Fans of the actors will undoubtedly enjoy it, of course, and such an effort certainly deserves recognition. But the story itself contributes nothing, neither to the film history wealth, nor to the poor audience's expectations, that are likely to feel rather down after the show, or even mad at the whole world for no apparent reason, just like the protagonist couple.

I really wanted to like this movie. Felt like a great take on the Broken American Dream. Instead however, I felt like killing myself at the end. Sure these people both felt stuck but seriously... Maybe I am just a stronger person. I have been there and was able to pull myself out of a rut and am better for it. However, these 2... I don't know it just seemed terribly depressing and wrong. There were so many ways they could have fixed their situation. But it is hard to feel sorry for them. They had a wonderful house, wonderful family, and sure they may have been a bit hindered by the children. But my God. I really wish they would have been poor, uneducated, and maybe even some type of refugees. Then I could have perhaps seen a bit of reason to feel sorry. Towards the middle I was hoping they would shoot each other. Terrible movie. I hope the book was better. Don't get me wrong. I don't need the happy ending to a movie. I actually like the spin when there is a bad ending. But in the end it was just a bad movie ending worse.
