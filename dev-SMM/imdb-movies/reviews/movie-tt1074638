### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
My 1st review! I was so disgusted with this film&annoyed critics praised it I cracked and had a rant. 

Numerous Plot holes, contrivances, poor storytelling, character logic&motivation;

1. The stolen agent list macguffin; Made famous in M:I then overused in films&TV shows; CharliesAngels2 etc - halfway through the film they just forgot about it

2. Hacking magic! Hacking can be done well; goldeneye,swordfish,diehard4...Not just an easy contrived plot device. Can we have a proper explanation &the rules&limitations of Silva's hacking ability in this fiction? For all I know Silva can make satellites fall on people.

3. The irony of the 'can Bond operate in an internet world' theme...he failed twice and got M killed...so he can't? 

4. How out of place the above theme is; Bond is mature but always current. His a walking encyclopedia (watch the start of any Connery/Moore film). In the last 2 films he was using advanced mobile phone tracking systems...adding hacking does not suddenly make Bond take on the 'modern' age. Are economics or funding civilwars outdated?

There was hacking&computers in 1995's Goldeneye..all of a sudden, NOW, there are no more shadows? Did MI6 stop evolving in the late eighties?

5.They have a meeting to discuss MI6? This was relevant in Batman, a vigilante was trying to inspire people- It was intertwined in the narrative&theme. Skyfall enquiry was just Sam Mendes ripping off Batman

6. Silva's planned capture; Another overused device that was coincidently in Batman. So what did Silva achieve? A conversation with M? When this is revealed shouldn't we look back and have everything make sense? But, NO, I was left wondering why they tried to kill Bond twice in China.

7. Why was a hacker in a cell controlled by a computer? Why is Q so stupid he plugged in the laptop to the building? Why was the trap door on the inside of the first glass door? why was there a trap door? How did Silva evade an armed MI6 guard 20 meters from his cell?

8. Super calculating (hack crazy)Silva's plan at the end was a firefight? With a backup plan of another firefight?

9. So they figured out Silva was dressed as a cop and no-one told anyone? The irony of M defending herself (reading a poem) knowing her own ex agent was about to shoot up the place was lost on critics&writers alike.

10. Could Bond not take a Sim free phone or'radio' &call backup when Silva arrived at the end? Instead they had their Home Alone moment- even Macaulay Culkin eventually called the police

11. Silva is supposed to mirror Bond. But compare Bond's 'betrayal' to Silva being handed over for torture... Some forced connection is made considering they never met before. Silva tells a story of 2rats so we know what we are supposed to think.

12. Bond's betrayal is M ordering Naomi to take a risky shot. Bond later tell's M he heard the order... why didn't he get out the way then? he just kept fighting like an idiot. &did Naomi only have 1 bullet?

13.You can't make Bond survive 2 gun shots and a fall like that. His already an established character. The Punisher&Bourne are special BECAUSE they survive. It can't happen to them again mid film/ mid franchise.. 

14. Bond follows an assassin&lets him kill innocent people! How is this in his character?! The previous 2 films already rebooted Bond to show WHY he doesn't let innocents die.

15. Naomi is a forced character..appearing randomly to remind us she still exists so we can think it's 'clever' when she becomes Moneypenny. Money penny gets demoted from field agent to secretary?!! not even analyst. If she is that hopeless why is she on the most important mission ever? I think Sam Mendes hates women. 

16. Bond doesn't even blink when the girl he just bedded a few hours ago gets shot in cold blood. He identifies Severine as being sex trafficked&abused- He then just jumps in her shower. I had little problem with Bond tricking a woman into bed in live and let die- but the sky-fall scene should land him in the S-offenders list. 

17.They traced the shrapnel in Bond's chest to a 'special'bullet that only 3 people use? His a 'ghost'...but we have his full flight manifesto. This is how they advanced the plot? wait a minute....didn't that bad guy shoot up half of turkey..? A contrivance& a plot hole in one plot device, that takes some doing.

18. One minute he can't shoot...10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a 360 arc? so what happened? oh we are just abandoning that theme mid- se.. 

19. Quite a few instances of Bond just standing in front of a landscape shot with his legs apart 'being deep'. I thought he was urinating at first. 

20. Q is both a quartermaster&a programmer for the sake of the illogical theme.. but these are completely different skill sets...?

21. Knowing all this...what is the list doing in Turkey? on a laptop hardrive? why are only 2-3 agents on the case? They couldn't even do the liberty of making something up for the audience. Imagine Thunderball didn't show how SPECTRE got the nukes...

Why couldn't Silva just hack the list? Oh because it isn't connected to the internet you say...but the MI6 heating system is?

The script makes no sense, the themes are inappropriate, Bond's character&decision making has been altered &they have confused mature with dinosaur. Die another Day was almost a Bond parody, but this one is simply a mess,&a betrayal of Bond.

Shame on critics too impatient to appreciate QoS for not spoon feeding them everything & praising sky-fall because of poorly scattered themes& metaphors on a plot that makes no sense, just because it makes them feel clever

I should preface this by saying that I absolutely loved QoS (more than most)and Casino Royale. I'll start from the top.

The Opening Credits: 

Visually the opening sequence was absolutely brilliant. Perhaps the best yet. However the Adele song choice was a poor one in my opinion. It's pap. Neither sexy (Goldeneye, Goldfinger) nor adrenaline pumping (Casino Royale, QoS). Sure the girl can sing... but so can Madonna.

Friendly Fire: 

He gets shot with an assault rifle, falls 100+ feet and ends up at the bottom of a 50ft+ waterfall. Of course Bond doesn't need to be realistic but let's at least have a far-fetched explanation for his survival please. A small Turkish boy with a first aid kit who happened to be fishing at the bottom of the waterfall. Anything!

Macau: 

Why no proper shots of Macau? Even just a decent panned intro. It's such a perfect setting for bond scenes.

The Komodo Dragon Killing:

No need for an Attenborough lecture. As convincing as fanged unicorns. 

The Bond Girl:

A sex slave who very quickly gets shot. What a big letdown after Casino Royale and QoS. 

The London Feel 

The film had very real shots of an overcast and murky looking London and the whole film felt inherently British. Really nice.

'Silva': 

I'm all for a fruity bond villain but what an anti-climax. Great intro, cool teeth but otherwise fairly bland. Certainly no Ernst Blofield or 'Leshiffre'. 

Weak Plot: 

The biggest failing of this film was the plot. It went from a mission to recover a stolen hard-drive to a mission to protect an old dear (who could've easily been killed several times). As for the motive, fairly tenuous and uninteresting: 

Blondie signed up for the Mi6 many years back, M sent him on a mission, things go wrong on the mission, Blondie gets captured (we don't get shown any of this) and years later Blondie feels as though he wants to kill an older, moodier and fairly unendearing M. 

The House Siege: 

This was cool. Easily on par with scenes from Shooter and The Bourne Identity (tall order). 

The Chapel: 

Be honest. When Silva walks into the chapel were you thinking:

'Please don't shoot moody old M!'

Or were you thinking:

'NOOOOOOO! Please don't shoot the cool old guy with a sawn-off shotgun who's been giving Bond some lip! He's the only new face that's been given a proper character!' 

As for the axe to the back - not exactly bond-like. 

Conclusion: 

Ingredients for an epic film. But an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome.

There were so many problems with the film that I felt let down. I feel that Casino Royale was the best film to date; Skyfall was just a disappointment.

The first 10 minutes or so were great, Bond's on a mission and there are some memorable scenes (digger coupling the trains), but there are major plot-holes. When Bond is fighting on top of the train for the hard- drive, Eve says that she has a shot. 

Bond can hear the whole conversation between Eve and M, so why doesn't he get out of the way (or at least co-operate to provide an easy shot)?! M mentions that the choice was either possible success (taking the shot) or guaranteed failure (leaving Bond to fight). You'd have more chance with a TOP MI6 AGENT than a risky shot.

I must be missing something, because QOS shows Bond finishing his FIRST assignment, where Skyfall shows him to be old, out of shape, and at the end of his career; there's a MASSIVE gap between the two films. It's almost as if the last two films and the reboot have been ignored.

The Aston Martin from Goldfinger, Q's mentioning of the exploding pen (Goldeneye), and the appearance of Q (In the previous two films, Bond has not met Q) seem to make it clear that CR and QOS have been forgotten, and so Skyfall was used purely for a "50 year special", looking back at the previous bonds.

When Bond leaves a trail leading to his house, why on earth wouldn't he call back up to meet him there? If you have the Head of MI6 under protection, you would need some actual protection - the plot makes no sense!

Why did Silva want to get captured? He just escapes! If he wanted to kill M, he could have done that with the explosion in her office (with a delay), so what purpose did his capture possess? None!

Overall, I was disappointment with Skyfall; possibly the worst Bond film to date. I expect more from Bond, and I hope that the next film forgets Skyfall!

One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie, you can't just wave it to one side.

For example, when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly, M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly, why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors, like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.

Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene, why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors, Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene, how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable, even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the camp/gay innuendos were painful to watch. I couldn't believe what I was watching.

This was an appalling movie. It relied on Judi Dench to hold it all together. Sadly I am not able to give it a 0 so I will give it 1/10. No action in the movie what so ever after the opening scene. Two men hugging on top of a train has been done so many times. Pathetic movie and the only people who will enjoy this are the brain dead. Shame on critics who were saying this was the best Bond movie ever, you should be ashamed of yourselves.

I used to like Daniel Craig as Bond but thanks to this movie I now dislike him too. Well done to Sam Mendes and Co, it takes a certain amount of talent or the lack of it to single handedly destroy Bond. The hero in this movie was the final credits, the real baddie in this movie was the man behind the camera.

this time it's getting even worse than Quantum Of Solace. The story is lame and stupid, the nonsense plot is build around a melodramatic inside view of Bond's psyche. O.K., when Bond is no bigger than life daredevil anymore, it seems to be a logical consequence, to let the audience learn more about the "true" psyche of Bond. But this is completely crap in my eyes!

An other complacent try by Mrs. Broccoli to revitalize the dusty genre of spy movies. But the audience was always smarter and realized, of course, that Bond never was realistic. The audience does not need to be educated in the direction of a more temporary 21st. century Bond by some filmmakers who do not want become suspects of doing the same thing all over again. Bond WAS always the same for 40 years till Albert Broccoli died and his very very untalented daughter took over the franchise automatically. This happens when you bequeath a business,there is no warranty that your children are going to handle it well.

The real Bond is a classical archetype male and a chauvinistic, arrogant womanizer with a very dangerous job (secret agent), no woman can withstand although she knows what a heart breaker he is. This worked for 40 years and would have worked for another 40 years or so. The Bond we knew until Craig appeared might not be the type of man radical left-wing Eco-activist broads would like to welcome to their sit-in. 

Fact is, the real Bond is dead!

This is a private version of Mrs. Broccoli's fantasy Bond 008, a guy who deeply comprehends women instead of bumping them before they can count to three (which might be a challenge for some real Bond girls...). Of course it's intended not to be "your dirty old father's" Bond. It's a Bond for the masses not for the classes, offering a bit of everything the average movie goer under 20 (Twilight-fans) might want to consume.

Craig's Bond has become a sissy, who has a complex oedipal relationship to elder women, especially to those he calls "M". Now, in Skyfall, we will learn that "M" is for "mother"... 

There really was no need to change the Bond franchise so completely, except to squeeze out some dollars more out of the franchise. R.I.P. 007!

I thought Skyfall was awful. Worst of all it was just boring, something I would never think I would say about any Bond film.

The movie starts off well enough, a good chase scene in an exotic location and it sets itself up for what could have been a good story. The trouble is after the first 15 mins the story seems to go nowhere.

MI6 is in trouble, a list of its agents goes missing and has to be recovered. Bond who everyone thought was dead comes back to save the day. All good so far. Now for some very thin reason Bond has to go to Shanghai. I wonder if this scene was added to boost box office figures in China because it was totally irrelevant to the story. Next scene Bond meets the 'baddie'. Not some master criminal but an ex MI6 agent out for some revenge. This plot had already been covered in Goldeneye with much better results. The Baddie looked more likely to Blow Bond than Blow up MI6 and there was even a joke along that line.

The story now moves to London. I applaud the decision to have a Bond movie in the UK, especially in the Jubilee/Olympic/50 year Bond year but frankly it just painted England like every foreigners stereotype. Cold, Wet, and miserable. Now it is about a plot to kill M, this has also been covered before in 'The World is not Enough' and the movie never returns to locating the missing list of agents.

Why didn't the bad guy just kill M at the beginning of the movie and spare me sitting through 2 hours of boredom? I gave this film 4/10 because it has an unexpected twist at the end that the production team have managed not to leek prior to release. If it were not for that then Id probably have given it only 3/10.

Craig is now showing his age and in my opinion there are many better suited actors to the part. People moaned about QOS but frankly this movie is the worst Bond film ever.

***BEWARE - MAJOR SPOILERS - BEWARE - MAJOR SPOILERS - BEWARE - MAJOR SPOILERS***

Amongst the very worst of the Bond series. Surprisingly, after an action-packed pre-credit sequence it became so slow, plodding and tedious I wasn't sure it was actually supposed to be an action movie after all. Then a few unimaginative 'action-sequences' were thrown in and we were supposedly off, except that the dull, leaden script (except for a couple of sparkling moments) and badly contrived storyline (meandering between inanely pointless set pieces and sheer unbelievability) never actually let the film take off at any point. And there were so many plot-holes you could fire an Uzi a full 360 and not hit a thing. All this and what appears to be a complete aversion to many of the long-standing characteristics that always made Bond who he is (and made a Bond movie a Bond movie) and you have a dull, third-rate spy movie about some tough bloke employed by Whitehall.

If the central character's name was altered from Bond to, say, Jack Steel or something, there would be little if anything left in the movie to suggest you might be watching a Bond movie.

Yes, its tough and gritty, but gone is the suave, sophisticated, knowledgeable, utterly committed agent we are used to, now we have a stroppy, confused man moping about getting drunk instead of reporting for duty; who about a quarter way through the film remembers where he left his razor and even gets himself together enough to shave; who, after being felt-up by a homosexual villain, alludes to previous homosexual experiences he might have had; and who hatches a really stupid plan to use M as bait by taking her to a completely isolated manor house with hardly any firepower available, whilst inviting the baddies to come and get them, which they do with more men and more firepower than Bond thought to bring along; not surprisingly Bond's daft 'plan' to get the villain results in Bond getting his boss killed.

If the makers of the film want to revisit classic Bond, perhaps the theme song to this one should have been "Nobody Does It Worse."

Bond is dead.

There are so many things wrong with this movie. Most of the elements of a good Bond movie aren't there.

The locations aren't well used. The Istanbul roof top & Bazaar chase has already been shown in "Taken 2" and the TV show "Missing". Dejavu. The way they showed 'Shanghai' and 'Macau' at night it could have been filmed anywhere. The Scottish countryside shown was so grim.

Where are the cars and gadgets? Nothing but the old Aston Martin. Just that pistol and tracker. The new Q is so ineffective. 

The villain played by Javier Bardem. He is more comical than sinister. With the blond fright wig, the campy overtures and the most frightening of all, the dentures this must the most absurd bad guy in Bond history.

The climax feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defences and geriatric defenders, it felt like Home Alone meets the Golden Girls. Might as well have asked Betty White or grandma to join in. 

The new Bond girl Berenice Marlohe is exotic and fascinating to look at. But why only one? Writing her out of the show so early and not having another was a mistake. The Bond girl is supposed to end up saved by Bond with a hook up at the end. Unless you consider M a Bond girl.

The focus of the movie is M. Judi Dench was always too provincial looking for MI6. The only good thing about this movie is that Ralph Fiennes is replacing her. Finally. There was no need to dedicate a whole movie to her farewell. 

Daniel Craig is just so haggard he looks worse than the villain. It's time to replace him with someone younger and handsomer. Baffled by the good reviews. Be warned we are being short changed.

My first review on IMDb, couldn't resist offering some balance to the obvious early march of fanboy reviews! Always been abit of a Bond fan and I was looking forward to being taken away to some exotic locations, to escape for a few hours, and some edge of seat action but these things were missing from Skyfall.

Production standards have slipped terribly on Skyfall with stuntmen clearly visible (motorbike chase)and some of the worst sets I have ever seen. The Skyfall Lodge (Bond's family home) is especially appalling and some people even laughed in the cinema when they pulled up in the old Aston.

The Q character doesn't work at all, not convincing in any way with the fake glasses and daft hair...EON please rethink this for the next movie and also forget the Moneypenny actress because she cannot act, least not in this character anyway.

Some of the SFX were good but the opening chase scene was way to long and instead of building suspense most people just got bored.

The french actress Berenice was superb as was Rory Kinnear, though for me Craig struggled to capture my attention like he did in Casino Royale.

Bardem was underused or poorly directed and never intimidating as a true 'baddie' should be, and why oh why did they dye his hair? it was so so unconvincing.

I have yet to meet anybody who thinks this is a great movie let alone 'the best Bond ever!' I am staggered that some people like this Bond but I guess we are all different! I wonder how these figures are calculated as most of the last few thousand votes have been poor but I am new to IMDb (great site by the way)so maybe it takes awhile for the early enthusiast votes to be corrected by more 'normal' viewings?! And I suppose there will always be the fan element hell bent on 'talking a movie up' whereas someone who has watched a film they dislike generally will just want to forget about it!

For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies, Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.

The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever (it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one), we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined, a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.

What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula inside-out. While there is an element of globetrotting, and exotic locales are definitely featured, much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And, without giving too much away, the movie's finale is set-up as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.

This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up (it is a Bond movie after all). But when they do, we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe, when things go wrong, M is called to testify before a committee hearing.

The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films, he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out, he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job, but we also dig deeper into his back-story than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series, then Skyfall completes the Bond "origin story". In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.

Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination, but rather, revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide, the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie: two great actors going head-to-head.

There are also Bond girls, naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory woman-with-a-tragic-past. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty, principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a non-romantic way, she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.

Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond, then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits, "James Bond Will Return".

Like thousands of others I am a Bond fan and although we all have differing views on what Bond should be, we all expect a good Bond movie to be an escape from our day to day lives. A glamorous life full of suspense and intrigue. Skyfall has no suspense, intrigue or glamour (save for Berenice) and as such is not escapism and not a 'Bond film'. Casino Royale was a Bond film and a very good one at that, so this mess isn't Craig's fault.

Like others I also saw terrible sets especially Skyfall Lodge which looked like something from a sixties TV series, crossroads or it's a knockout!

Also I noticed clear as day Craig's stuntman on several occasions, completely ruining for me the roof top motorbike chase. Continuity errors all over the place not worthy of a Bond film from any era.

Q was miscast and his specs were embarrassing, all wrong wrong wrong.

The new Moneypenny should never sleep with Bond and Naomie Harris cannot act to save herself.

Berenice Marlohe is amazing, an incredible actress and totally stunning. My one point out of ten is all for her!

Another weird thing about this Bond.....nobody mentions 'Britain' only 'England' - is this a future proofed Bond ready for Scottish independence?! England is mentioned several time but not Britain anymore even though we saw union jacks but no George flag. A small point to some but a major puzzle to some, what is this all about?

Never ever did I have all these concerns watching a Bourne movie or even the brilliant TV series Homeland, in these productions you never stop to think 'this isn't real' because it is all done so well that you just get wrapped up in it all. Not so this film for me, so so many errors that I couldn't wait to get out of the cinema. Above all this film bored me and depressed me, something I have never said about any Bond film before, not even Q of Solace.

The real puzzle for me is who likes it? My straw poll of 11 people has brought up 8 who disliked it and felt tricked, with the rest not bothered either way so how come all the hype? How come all the glowing professional reviews? It's almost 'the king has no clothes' situation isn't it? Or maybe all the pro UK stuff in our Olympic year of celebration has made everyone lose their objectiveness.

Either way I have yet to meet anyone who thought this was a great movie.

It's the Bond film we've all been waiting for. After the stunning reinvention of Casino Royale and the misstep that followed with Quantum of Solace, Skyfall feels like a true resurrection of the character and the Bond universe, and an incredible addition to the storied franchise. From its spectacular opening scene in Istanbul to its sensational climax in the Scottish Highlands, the film grabs hold of the audience and never lets go.

With the great Sam Mendes at the helm, Skyfall is propelled by a veritable narrative purpose. Mendes values story and character over anything, and he gets Bond. His action sequences are thrilling, artfully directed, and a joy to watch. He directs with finesse and nuance the powerful character-driven scenes. He understands the soul and essence of Bond and respects the spirit of the franchise but also breaks new ground with the treatment of the story.

Speaking of which, the script tells a moving, thematically resonant and intelligent story, and features superbly written scenes. It is more focused than Quantum of Solace, which felt oddly disjointed at times. Writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan elegantly balance humorous moments with truly dramatic ones while never straying from the emotional heart of the film. Best of all, they further develop Casino Royale's brilliant idea of delving into Bond's vulnerability and the result is a fascinating and flawed character. The human and moral stakes are high and much more personal this time around. The audience feels emotionally invested in the story. In the end, the film is a reflection on aging and on not only why the world needs Bond but also why he must and will endure.

Visually, Skyfall is a true wonder. Roger Deakins' cinematography is aesthetically magnificent and serves the story well. Deakins shoots Istanbul, London, Macau, Shanghai and the Scottish Highlands in a tasteful, artistic and original manner. It is by far the most beautifully shot Bond I have ever seen. Thomas Newman's score is terrific and rich, cleverly using the classic Bond theme in new and interesting ways and incorporating Adele's already-classic theme to create a memorable piece of music.

Finally, the cast all deliver fine performances. Daniel Craig gives a thoughtful, moving and nuanced performance, which constitutes his strongest interpretation of the character to date. Judi Dench offers a much more intimate and personal take on M. Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe are memorable. And what to say of Javier Bardem, who steals every scene he appears in? He is funny, unpredictable, frightening and most interestingly, tragic. A fantastic Bond villain.

If you had any reservation about seeing this film after the lacklustre Quantum of Solace, fear no more. Skyfall redeems faults of the past and is one of the best films of the year. It hits all the right notes. Sam Mendes has infused Bond with a deft sense of fun, pathos and class.

It's a great time at the movies.

"He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows." The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.

Let's be honest here, most Bond movies are tongue-in-cheek and pretty stupid and that's part of it's appeal. It's a fantasy world of beautiful women, gadgets, real stunts and cheesy one-liners but this so called "Real Bond" doesn't work for me. Were Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean Connery cyborg robots? I must have missed something.

Bond movies have their own style and special formula with the usual ingredients, similar to a Big Mac. In fact, others have made a very good living copying Bond, from Austin Powers, Johnny English, Spy Hard, Ispy and many more. But how do you copy this movie? It was like watching a straight-to-DVD Steven Seagal movie. Dare I even say worse than a Seagal movie.

Now most 'professional' film critics will say this is the 'best Bond movie ever' so that they can kiss butt to get more free tickets and invites to premieres, none of them are going to be honest. So as an average movie goer who has to pay to see the film I expect my money's worth. This movie was like paying for a Big Mac but just getting the bun and nothing in the middle.

Skyfall (or as I not-so-cleverly renamed it Skyfail) was boring from the beginning to the near end, only part I enjoyed was Bond in the very end. The cold and bleak landscape of Scotland was perfect for Bond. Unfortunately, the other characters at the end bored me. The baddie arrives in a military type helicopter with John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom blasted out from a speaker which was brilliant but where did he get it from? Surely they aren't available on ebay, are they? Most people will say they enjoyed the opening scene which in time they will probably realise was pretty awful and rather boring. An Audi slides on its side a few yards and somehow re-rights itself. With just a minor scratch on it, this is the 'action scene'. My teenager son causes more damage to his car on a Friday night. The Bikes even drive pass the same place twice which is unforgivable in any movie.

The Bond girls in Casino Royale (Eva Green and Caterina Murino) were gorgeous by anyone's standards but since then the Bond girls have been rather rough looking.

You don't get your money's worth in this movie nor do you see anything new. All you get is a director who thinks he knows best how to make a Bond movie and that the tried and tested formula is somehow wrong. 

We live in a tech world, the information age, but somehow Bond who has always been ahead in the tech department has now been left behind. He seems more interested in drinking and gambling than saving the world with a toaster that can turn into a 'Little Nellie'

Oh, how i miss you 007!

As a child, growing up with Bond I had the toys, The sleek silver DB5 with the ejector seat and the white Lotus that was a necessity come bath time. What do the kids now have from Bond I wonder? Gambling chips? Or some video game which is more violent than the movie?

It would have been nice to see a Bond movie on its 50th anniversary going all out with major action sequences as you would expect in an action movie such as Mission Impossible, Bourne or even a Terminator movie. Instead we are spoon fed a "Downton Abbey" version of Bond, we definitely had the cast all that was missing were the costumes.

The cast: Daniel Craig and his potato-field-like face looked more like Bond in this movie than the previous two. Javier Bardem was a let down and looked like a 70s porn director. Judi Dench gets to swear again, somehow they think it's cool to have an acclaimed actor swearing. Ralph Fiennes thought this was a WWII movie, all that was missing was his German SS costume, Naomie Harris has no real input, she's just chucked in to the grinder to appeal to a wider audience. Berenice Marlohe was somehow weaved into the story to let Bond order a drink and have sex, Albert Finney plays a Scot as bad as I would, Ola Rapace gets his part thanks to his real life wife and Ben Whishaw tries hard to play a geek with the usual geeky stereotype but ends up releasing the villain from his fish tank. Believe it or not but Q used to be intelligent... that's how he got a job at the Military Intelligence Department.

In my opinion, a Bond movie should look and feel like a... dare I say it,... a Bond movie. This was sadly a poor scripted, a poor acted and a poor attempt at making an action movie. In time this movie will go down as the worst Bond movie but right now the hype around it is causing a smoke screen. (That's how Bond saves M. Somehow the baddie shoots a few rounds at M and then out of nowhere decides to leave after going to all that trouble in finding her!). 

Albert Broccoli and Ian Fleming must be turning in their graves. It took 50 years for some sorry excuse of a director who thinks he's an artist of some sort to ruin it. Very sad time for Bond fans. A disappointment as a Bond movie or even a stand alone movie.

I give it a 1 for the helicopter scene and thank you Mr Hooker for waking me up.

Don't try to reinvent the Big Mac by taking the meat out of it.

Someone said to me 2 weeks ago just before Skyfall came out, "Is it just me or is this the most hyped and over-marketed Bond of all time?" I hadn't really thought about it, but once it was pointed out, I realised that for about 2 months before the release, you couldn't move for the billboards, bus-side ads, TV and radio spots, over-hyped theme song etc etc. I concluded it must be partly because it's the 50th anniversary, but I always worry when a film is this over-hyped, because it's very very difficult to meet expectations this high. Also, there's a danger people will have decided they love the movie before they even see it, and I think that's what's happened here. It's the Emperor's New Clothes. This is an average movie, at best.

There are so many reasons why this doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No, Goldeneye or Casino Royale, I'll just mention a few:

- Ridiculous Villain with a ridiculous plan: Are we expected to believe that this guy can put together a team of world class elite mercenaries, set up the most advanced cyber-terrorism organisation in the world, and all he wants to use it for is to kill his ex boss? It's just a limp, implausible plan.

- Major Plot Holes: As already mentioned by other users here, there's just so much that doesn't stack. Silva's whole plan is based around letting himself get caught, knowing where he'll be imprisoned, and knowing how to get from there to where M will be at that time? Surely if he can hack into any system in the world, including triggering a gas explosion in M's office, he could just arrange to break into her house at some point? Also, he's managed to plant explosives in the tunnels below the Underground, right at the point where Bond will be standing, at exactly the moment a train is passing overhead, and he did this years in advance? (minor point, that train was completely empty of people. Just lazy direction)

Quote (approximately anyway): "This guy is a ghost. Nobody knows anything about him; his real name or where he's from..... But we do know he'll be flying to shanghai in 2 days on flight 235 landing at 21.00". I mean come on.

- The Agents List: Did Silva actually steal this? If so, why? Just to get M and Bond's attention? And once he's started releasing the names, does he stop? Clumsy plot line.

- Komodo Dragons. Enough said.

I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's beautifully shot, has some decent action sequences, and explores new and interesting sides to a very well known character. But there's far too many problems with it up there with the best Bonds, or to put it in IMDb's top 250.

I have been a James Bond fan for years, but this movie was just badly bolted together. Why?

1. How did Eve, who was chasing the train in the truck and barely keeping up, suddenly get two or three minutes ahead of the train in time to set up for when it emerged from the tunnel? The timing simply doesn't work. 2. M orders Eve to "take the shot" three times. Bond heard them, and Eve's complaint that the shot wasn't clean. So why didn't Bond simply drop to the roof of the car and let her have the shot? If she missed, he could easily resume his fight in the next tunnel. 3. Why didn't Eve take a second shot at the henchman on the roof of the train after she shot Bond? The henchman had enough time to turn to her and all but wave a 'thank you', yet she didn't bother. 4. Bond survives the fall from the train how exactly? He is on the roof of a train moving at approximately 40mph when he is shot, catapulted backward, and falls hundreds of feet into a river. Because he is unconscious, he can not enter the water at a safe angle, and should have been killed. As if this isn't bad enough, the unconscious Bond is then swept over a high waterfall. The title sequences explain nothing of his escape, and when they end, Bond is in a hut on the beach bedding some girl. Not explaining his survival is a critical error which borders on ludicrous, yet somehow the audience is meant to take it all seriously. 5. It is clear that Eve is a poor field agent. Later, Bond suggests that she simply doesn't belong in the field. However, this raises the question: how did she acquire field agent status to begin with? 6. Bond always attempts to keep collateral damage amongst civilians to a minimum, and protects the defenseless. However in this film, he allows the villains to do their dirty work before he intervenes. 7. To this Bond, as developed in the last two films, women quickly became anything but 'disposable pleasures'. The death of Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale was a terrific trauma; when Ms. Fields is killed in Quantum, he is again visibly angry. However, in Skyfall Bond not only makes no attempt to save Sévérine (not even attempting to fight the henchmen to provide a distraction until the backup he knows is en route arrives), but he shows absolutely no glimmer of distress over her death. In fact, his first response is a fast, and badly delivered, quip about it being a 'waste of good Scotch.' 8. Silva had tried to take his own life by a hydrogen cyanide pill. Instead of killing him, he merely felt a burning sensation and had most of his teeth and jaw fell off. Such 'suicide pills' kill; they do not merely give one a little heartburn and bad teeth. 9. What was the point of Silva setting up his own arrest? Ostensibly, it is so that he can talk to M one last time. But why not just travel to London, abduct M from the hearing, and talk to her before doing her in? 10. If Q was good enough to have invented the security on Silva's computer, how was it that he was unable to stop it from freeing Silva? 11. How did Silva know that within just a few seconds of the blast an empty train would be coming through to conveniently fall on and crush Bond, allowing him to escape? 12. The 1964 Aston Martin made its triumphant return in this film, but unfortunately it did so in a way that created continuity errors and glaring reboot issues. It is not a 'company car,' so it must be the same Aston Martin that Bond won from Dimitrios playing cards in Casino Royale. However, it has all of the Q-branch add-ons from Goldfinger If this had been Dimitrios' car, why did it have the Goldfinger configuration from Q Branch? This thoroughly wrecked the film's continuity with the reboot. 13. What was the purpose of taking M to Skyfall? In the film, it is openly suggested that the plan is a trap to catch Silva, with M serving as the bait. However, if it is a trap, one would expect Bond to create a scenario where they would have a significant advantage. It is poorly explained why he doesn't want backup (he depended on them for extraction from Silva's island); he also takes no weaponry with them. Instead, the unlikely trio is forced to create a "Home Alone" style defense of Skyfall which is doomed to failure before it even begins 14. Why did the monk's tunnel lead, not all the way to the chapel, but into the middle of the moor? A half-tunnel is barely worth the effort to build. 15. When M and Kincade enter the tunnel to leave the house, Kincade closes and locks the door from the other side. Yet, when Bond decides to leave, he has no difficulty simply opening the door. 16. Why would M and Kincade, while secretly fleeing the attack through the moor in the middle of the night, use a flashlight to illuminate their path? This could only be a dead giveaway of their position to Silva and his henchmen. Why not just pull out a Las Vegas-style neon sign and have M cry out from the moor: "Oh, Silva, come and get us!" 17. Silva's death scene was preposterous, and very nearly Monty Python-esque. Bond stabs Silva in mid-back with a blade; it would have severed the spinal cord, causing instant paralysis before death. Yet Silva bizarrely laughs and staggers toward Bond. 18. There were many continuity mistakes introduced into the film through sloppy editing (such as M's handbag in Mallory's office).

Very badly done film.

This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great film.

It has been a long ride for the Bond series, since the creation of the character there have been 15 novels by Ian Fleming, plenty of spin-off novels, comics, cartoons and video games and the film series is now 50 years old. There have been an extraordinary 23 official films, but few as extraordinary as Skyfall.

After a mission goes wrong in Istanbul, MI6 loses a hard drive containing a list of all NATO agents within terrorist cells, and James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed Killed in Action. M's (Judi Dench) competence is questioned and the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) plans to replace her. Making matters worse, a cyber-terrorist targets MI6 and M personally, getting a hold of the list and causing an explosion within MI6's headquarters. An older, more damaged Bond then returns to duty to serve Queen and Country, having to prove he is in shape before going on the search to find the terrorist.

Skyfall is a long-awaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes, but it delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond films, Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and continues strongly from then on, including a very stylish silhouette fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and practical effects were at the forefront.

A challenge for the Bond series has always been real-world relevance. The series has faced down all challenges, from the end of the Cold War to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage. MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government denied existed; it has to face the realities of the 24-hour media age we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.

The nature of the threats have changed, Bond faces a cyber-terrorist and along with the new Q, both could cause more damage than Bond can. In the real world, we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says, she is scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now faceless and nationless, and this element can work in the series' favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark, which is why it is so enduring.

Skyfall also goes full circle for Bond, as the filmmakers reintroduce popular characters, gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale, Bond is a young man who is bold, arrogant and reckless but can get the job done; in Skyfall, Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and emotionally vulnerable.

The idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film Never Say Never Again, but that was more to accommodate a 52-year-old Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance, cementing his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond, and the script treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's character arch, the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can be cleansed.

The casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms, but the master planner has a very sinister delivery. He has a complex, tragic background but he is not like other Bond villains looking for control, world domination, money or even self-preservation: he simply wants revenge.

Skyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film, and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing, but rather nice touches. The last anniversary Bond film, Die Another Day, was a disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few major references to previous Bond films: Bond getting injured (The World is Not Enough), Bond faking his death (You Only Live Twice), the gun that can only work with Bond's palm print (Licence to Kill) and a similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you would want to find, not being forced upon you.

Skyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a film that has a 143-minute running time (the second longest Bond film), Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting, entertaining film.

First of all it is a decent action movie, but that is about it. It would be even better if they removed the James Bond completely. Why call it James Bond if you remove the gadgets the cars and the girls. (prob. to get better sales..)

A radio and a personal gun? Budget for Gadgets was only enough to place 4 leds on a fake gun and buy a toy radio? And then re-use an old bond car? Was there no budget to get a Aston martin one 77? 

The hacking stuff was boring and full of plot holes, they obvious did not have a budget for a decent evil lair (that island was fake and the room with the servers was cheap) so they used the digital terrorist as an excuse. 

Moneypenny was boring and way to ugly for a decent bond girl. 

James being an alcoholic and screwing whores, then gets her killed, nice plan there who the f is the bad guy? Almost looks like he planned this, so nobody would find out he screwed a prostitute. 

They go to some remote place instead of some military base, lets go to some place where the bad guys can just blow up the entire house and have a nice bbq after that. Why use Q gadgets if you can make bombs out of plastic bags and light bulbs. Who needs a Billion dollar budget for intelligence just use haunting rifles and improvised booby-traps.

They at least could film someone walking with a flashlight in the distance but they obvious said to some one: "You, go there and just go nuts with the flashlight so it is clear to the viewer. And why would you walk there with a flashlight? You could put a giant glowing sign on your head, with: "we are here, please shoot us".

At the end he is crying like a little baby about a woman who gave an order that almost killed him. James Bond died there not M, M is just a replaceable character.

Next time just call it "MI6 the movie" and don't use James Bond.

This film effectively kills off the character we all know and love. The plot is shot full of holes, the villain a camp idiot, no Bond girls to speak of, unless sex slaves are your thing (truly vile of Craig not to have objected to that storyline), pointless and seriously unfunny dialogue, unriveting action scenes most of which we've seen done better elsewhere, and telegraphing of practically every prop placement. Oh, wait, there's more: an awful and forgettable Bond film song sung by that large, breathy lady who fudges the top notes and has merely rehashed Goldfinger. And a limp ending. 

To be fair I liked the opening credits (minus the song) and I thought Bérénice Marlohe acted well, and Ralph Fiennes enunciates well. The shots of London were OK and the skyscraper neon dazzled - even if the plot at that point fell apart faster than the shot glass. 

I wanted to like this film. I wanted to give the mumbling Craig one last chance, but he just isn't Bond, so what do they do? They write a blancmange Bond so Craig will fit right in. Meanwhile we are left holding ticket stubs asking what was THAT all about? It was about a lot of things that had nothing to do with our James. Almost everything that kept the franchise going for 50 years has been interfered or radically dispensed with on purpose! No gadgets, no credible Bond car (they destroy the iconic one - unsubtle flagging of what they are doing to our Bond?). Moneypenny is now black and totes a gun (I kid you not - how do they explain away her colour? But worse, she is (it's all so wrong!) attractive and (sob) beds Bond - words fail.) Dench's M is, as usual, flat and unconvincing but at least she's out of the next films - a good career move, one that Craig should take. Q is a horrible little boy you can't possibly believe a hacker even if you accept the stupidity of casting Q as one...and with big black glasses? Come on...

Maybe Bond should always stay in the 60s, 70s. I mean you don't update Hercule Poirot and have him ponce about in the 21st century. I think they should just stop the Bond farce right now. It can and will only get worse.

MINOR SPOILERS

Sam Mendes's take on 007 is a remarkably well done film, both technically and entertainment-wise, it has the characters, the action, and the Bond allure which is a constant throughout the movie.

It captures you right with the opening sequence, which is absolutely thrilling and beautifully choreographed, the whole movie is nicely choreographed and very well shot (Roger Deakins's cinematography is a stand out). The key characters are well presented, with each of them having their own layers, and the movie dives specifically into Bond's psyche, which gave us on the way, the right dose of Bond origins (not too much, not too little). The lead acting is fantastic, Craig as Bond, which in my opinion is the best who portrayed the Iconic spy, Dench as M, and Bardem as Silva, which by himself takes the movie to a whole new level both as an actor and the character itself, since among the Daniel Craig-led 007's, Skyfall is the first film to bring us a true villain, an archenemy, one that is actually in-par to Bond himself. Skyfall also brings new additions and takes some out that leaves a lot to be explored in sequels (several new characters that will most probably be reprised again, and yes, there is death). And there is a very, very nice retro touch to the film that pays homage to 50 years of James Bond.

This however does not mean the film is perfect at all, it does have several issues of its own, issues that stand out. The overall story does not hold itself very well, specifically the final act, which might be considered a bit... stupid. Some characters and the architecture surrounding them did not Solid nor necessary, the whole Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) charade felt imposed and like a plot device just to introduce a an action sequence, a fling, and shed a little light on the villain. To me, the most un-Bond thing about Skyfall was that, 007 was more of a hit-man than a spy, he had one, maybe two "spying" missions, which included lots of killing, the rest was a shoot-em up, more like an open war movie than an espionage one.

And as for the temporary feel of the film (in the time of its release), the trailer had a very negative effect, it gave out almost every key scene and one liner in the film, leaving almost nothing to surprise you at the theater, this however cannot be held against the movie's lifetime position since trailers do not live forever, opposing to Bond films which actually do seem to live forever.

If I have to place this film among the other Craig-led Bond movies, it falls somewhere between "Casino Royale" and "Quantum Of Solace"

Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. 

There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. 

Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. 

The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves. 

A washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. 

But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old. 

All the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins. 

It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10

I saw skyfall today and found it to very boring and predictable.

The movie theme was not like a bond movie at all but a typical revenge drama. Didn't the bond team learn anything from the quantum of solace?

The movie was so predictable

1. The guy would have planned his capture just to get inside the HQ.

2. Bond cuts out a bullet (terminator style) from his body and they immediately narrow down 3 people in the world who use such bullets and first one on the computer screen is the culprit. Too luckily for MI6, the Americans already know that he is in Shanghai in next 2 days. Whoa!!!!

3. That old puts a knife on the table and says sometimes old fashioned things work the best (and that time everyone knows that the bad guy would get the chop from the knife)

4. 20 trained assassins with machine guns and a military helicopter cannot kill a old woman, and old man, and bond armed with 50 year old double barrel gun.

5. Villains always waste time blabbering nonsense (like you need to relax and take a breath) when they capture bond ... Giving him to escape.

Overall a very pointless and very bad movie which lives upto all the clichés of a bond movie making it highly predictable and boring.

This is right up there with Mortal Kombat 2 and 2012 as the worst movies I've sat through in the theater. Nothing made sense and they insulted your intelligence time and time and time again.

Spoilers Ahead.

The first hour was actually pretty interesting - albeit bizarre. That Bond survived the fall without any explanation was odd but hey, I can live with one miracle resurrection - it's a Bond movie. The sequence in Shanghai was also pretty well done and the silhouette fight was great cinematography - but again - Bond lets the bad guy shoot his target? But who's the target? And if he wanted to trail him to know who he was working for - why would he kill him? But OK, he finds a clue and goes to Macau, where he redeems a chip that obviously isn't for him. So, instead of being interrogated by the Casino staff/thugs - a woman comes up to him and more or less gives up her boss, with her handlers a few feet away. What? OK so then there's an obligatory fight in a kimodo dragon pit, which is short but fun, and then off to Japan's battleship island to meet...possibly the most inconsistently motivated villain of all time.

Silva's entrance is menacing, the story about the rats in the barrel is sinister, and he's flamboyant enough to say 'this guy creeps me out'. But he reveals nothing about his operation, and this is the start of where his motivation just dissolves.

The first part of the movie is about an agent list and hurting MI6. We learn on the island that he was somehow hurt/betrayed by MI6 and that he wants to share his revenge with Bond, who also, in a very roundabout way, was also betrayed (said he was up to field service when he failed all the tests). Bond of course rejects this offer, and then after a brief fight, has an army come rescue him - because of a radio transmitter. Really? No one searched him before getting on the island? It was in his coat pocket! But OK, we're then learn that M gave Silva up to get some of her agents in return, which really upset Silva. So Silva breaks out of prison in one of the most ludicrous scenes imaginable, and this is where it all starts to go pear shaped.

Silva reverse hacks MI6, and he wanted to get captured. Ultimately, he breaks out with armed guards surrounding him with no explanation how that happened. Then he goes through the tunnels of London...to arrive at a tube station with some handguns, and eventually crash a parliamentary meeting and shoot M in the face. But wait - he clearly had a bomb - he blew up a tube line. OK, he wanted her death to be up close and personal. Why not back at MI6? He clearly didn't need to be captured by MI6 to get to the station, and he'd proved earlier that he could hack their most secure networks and gain access. Why not walk right through the front door and put a bullet in her face? But then Bond saves the day and they go off to the Scottish highlands (a nod to Connery being a Scot) to hide/lay a trap. Except - MI6 knows where he's going. Why isn't there an army waiting for Silva when he gets there? Oh but wait, the motivation changes continue! During the house fight scene, Silva's henchmen (and there's NO explanation as to where these guys come from) shoot at M, even hitting her. So, she's either not supposed to be taken alive or Silva's men are idiots. But it gets better! Silva then shows up IN A HELICOPTER. Why? To blow up the house with a 20mm cannon! So, when Silva had ample opportunity to use a bomb, he didn't - he wanted her to know it was him who killed her. Now, he's spraying a house with cannon fire with no idea who or what he's shooting at. So now his motivation is he wants her dead at all costs. In that case, why not bring a few RPGs? or a missile? After all, they did just commandeer a MILITARY HELICOPTER! Of course, Bond survives the house being turned into swiss cheese, blows it up with two sticks of dynamite and compressed propane, and then runs off into the wilderness to save M - but before he does, he gets into one last night and plunges into FROZEN WATER, has a fight underwater for what seemed like a few minutes, then somehow gets out of the water, shrugs off hypothermia with again, NO EXPLANATION, to find Silva confronting M.

By now, Silva wants M to help him commit suicide. WHAT? Since when did he have a death wish? Why? Cause he tried to kill himself when he was being tortured and it failed? What's his motivation? Didn't he just try to turn her into Ragu with a 20mm cannon not 10 minutes earlier? Now he wants to die by her hands? And we're supposed to believe this? No. Sorry, but I can only have my intelligence insulted so often. Bond surviving death multiple times with no explanation is insulting. Having Silva's motivation change THREE TIMES is insulting. Having MI6 look like the Keystone Cops is insulting. Foreshadowing EVERY SINGLE TWIST/ELEMENT is insulting. Please, if you don't want your intelligence insulted, DO NOT see this movie.

This contains spoilers.

I have never before wrote a comment on IMDb.com. But after seeing the high rating of this complete insult of a classic character called James Bond i had to say something. 

Let me start by saying this movie have taken plots from like 10 different movies. Involving Bourne, Batman, Die Hard, Swordfish, Charlie's Angels Mission Impossible and more. Stolen agents list villains getting caught intentionally and a bunch of other stuff you seen in so many movies. Its Bond in a midlife crisis with everyone doubting him.

The Bond chick dies rather quick and seems terrified of the bad guy in this movie. Why? who knows. Never really no explanation there is no explanation to the bad guy Silva at all. He is just a bad ass former agent from M's days in Hong Kong who she sold out and is know out to get M. He has these super hacking skills which are not explained neither. He is just hacking the hell out of MI6. 

And of course a very obvious Moneypenny made an entrance and she is black not that its a problem it's just that it screams affirmative action I'm half black by the way. Then you have a washed up Bond?? When was Bond ever washed up ever? Crying over M who gave the clearance to take a shot with Bonds life at stake she didn't seem to care very much. 

You have a young Q coming in and say we don't use gadgets no more. The gadgets are a part of James Bond it spiced the movies. The movie all trough was a disaster it was bad from beginning to end. This was even worse then Quantum Solace. 

You know i wouldn't have mind the bad plot if i had gotten some comic release or some proper James Bond moments. There were none. Where are the sarcastic comments the witty comebacks to women at cocktail parties?? James Bond is truly dead after this. i remember the golden ages of Connery and Moore. One scene when Bond was caught by a women i recall and, she went i got you now mister Bond, Connery responded well enjoy yourself. Comments like that made me love Bond. There was never no super effects or nasty close combats. He was a spy with a gun who dressed act and looked as a gentleman. Not like this brute who runs around beating people like a Van Damme movie is very emotional and don't seem to be very good with the women at all. Which makes me think why does he get these women?? And oh lets not forget running around half the movie with his shirt off. Don't know how many looking in the mirror without a shirt on scenes this movie had.

Anyways i hope they stop making Bond or first get a new Bond and a better plot.
