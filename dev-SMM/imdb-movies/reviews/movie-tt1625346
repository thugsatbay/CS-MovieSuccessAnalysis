### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark-hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody ("Juno"). She's absolutely spot-on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Mavis is no Blanche Dubois-type character whose ladylike beauty has faded into a gauzy romantic delusion. No, Mavis is still one hot babe and very much the complete narcissist she was as a teenager, emotionally stunted despite her relative worldliness having moved to Minneapolis to become a ghostwriter of a series of teen novels.

It's not surprising she finds success writing for an adolescent audience since she still defines her life with teenage-level priorities and fantasies. As she has proved with "Juno", Cody is thoroughly fluent with this perspective, but the twist is that this time, it's coming from a jaded 37-year-old woman. Even though Mavis is a divorc√©e who lives in a high-rise apartment with a toy dog and can easily get any man she wants, she is triggered by a birth announcement email she receives from her high school sweetheart Buddy Slade and becomes fixated on getting him back all these years later. It doesn't matter that he's happily married and perfectly content living in Mercury. She concocts a scheme to make herself so alluring that he will want to run away with her. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction all the more edgily desperate.

It's a narrowly developed plot for sure, but surprisingly, what enriches the proceedings is the unexpected relationship Mavis develops with Matt Freehauf, a sad-sack former classmate whose sole claim to notoriety was being the victim of a hate crime when he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay. He has been left crippled, living in Mercury with his sister making his own home-brewed bourbon and putting together mix-and-match action figures. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their present-day bond is also fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. The story evolves in the direction you would expect but not before certain revelations come to light in a tortuous scene at the baby-naming party Buddy and his sensible wife Beth have with all their relatives and close friends in attendance.

Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt. I only know him from his recurring role as a comical sad-sack on the sitcom "King of Queens", so it's surprising to see the amount of texture he brings to this role. As Buddy, Patrick Wilson once again plays the sought-after himbo, but this time, his character's unshaven, small-town modesty comes across as more contrite with his character's feelings toward Mavis left quite elliptical. Elizabeth Reaser ("Sweet Land") isn't given that much to do as Beth, probably by intention, but Collette Wolf has a few impactful moments as Matt's insulated sister still idolizing Mavis after all these years. As he showed with "Juno" and "Up in the Air", Reitman shows a deft hand with actors playing flawed characters who try to manipulate their circumstances but fall short of their vaunted expectations.

Greetings again from the darkness. Writer Diablo Cody and Director Jason Reitman reunite for the first time since their breakout hit "Juno". In that fine film, we were treated to many optimistic and sarcastic life lessons from a very likable, and easy to cheer for, teenage girl. This time around we get the caustic, childlike self-centeredness of a mid-30's alcoholic sadly trying to recapture the magic of her high school years as the prom queen dating the coolest guy.

Ms. Cody and Mr. Reitman deserve much credit for steering clear of the Hollywood traditions of redemption, remorse, and turning over a new leaf. In fact, we probably dislike Mavis (Charlize Theron) even more as the movie ends than we did in the film's first 5 minutes, if that's even possible. It takes courage as a filmmaker to have a lead character who is disliked through the entire movie, not just by the people in her life, but also by the audience. It also takes a special actress to pull this off. If you saw Theron in her Oscar winning role in "Monster", believe me when I say that she is equally unsympathetic here ... though she does commit fewer actual crimes.

This film is erroneously marketed as a smart comedy. While there are some funny elements, it's difficult to find much humor in someone who is so unstable and narcissistic. Wisely, the script provides us with Matt (Patton Oswalt) as the voice of reason. He sees through the Mavis mask and speaks directly in his attempts to divert her from her plan. That plan is to break up the marriage of her high school sweetheart (Patrick Wilson). Oh yeah, he just happens to be happily married (Elizabeth Reaser) with a newborn baby.

The best scenes of the film are between Mavis and Matt. She is oblivious to her negative effect on others, while he shoots her straight while avoiding his own harsh reality. See, Matt was the victim of a vicious hate crime, which left his leg (and other things) mangled. His own view of life is why he can see right through Mavis and her issues. While I so admire the basis of the script, I just believe there is a missing element. The element of hope and optimism. Heck, even when Mavis admits she "might be an alcoholic", her parents shrug it off and change topics. Sometimes crying out for help just isn't enough.

The film is worth seeing for the performances of Theron and Oswalt, as well as for the unique script. Just don't get tricked into believing it's some laugh riot with a fairy tale ending. Mavis is a ghost writer for teen novels, and she writes the latest as she lives this nightmare of a trip back home. My only real question ... is she mature enough to write for teens?

This film is highly recommended.

Finally a holiday movie comes along that dares to ask, " Can a high school prom queen steal her happily married ex-boyfriend from his wife and newborn child and find true love? " From the team that brought us the classic comedy, Juno, comes the wickedly entertaining, and to some, offensive Young Adult. 

Directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody, this dark comedy explores the aspirations of a beautiful, vain, and selfish woman as she schemes to breakup a marriage and reclaim her former sweetheart, Buddy. Now divorced, Mavis Gary ( Charlize Theron ), a ghostwriter of teen literature conveniently found in the YA section of bookstores everywhere, has never grown up and never had the life she felt destined to have. ( After all, she was voted Best Hair in her high school yearbook! ) Her life is in ruins, an eternal victim of herself. She decides to return to her small hometown hoping to snare her former sweetheart ( nicely downplayed by Patrick Wilson ) and with that in mind, live some of the glories of her past life. As Mavis mentions in one scene, "Love conquers all. "Haven't you seen The Graduate? " She lives in a fantasy world, clouded by booze.

Giving her a reality check about her plans is a dweeb from the past, Matt Freehauf ( Patton Oswalt ), whom Mavis meets at a local bar. She doesn't so much rekindle their friendship as she never had time for him before, just not in her league back then. "Oh, you're that hate crime guy," she says when they meet. Insensitive, yes. That's Mavis, and yes, Matt was permanently injured in a gay hate crime during his senior year, although he wasn't gay at all. Shades of irony! ( Not that there's anything wrong with that, yada, yada!) Alcohol (and there's plenty in use when Mavis is around ) brings these two lost souls together, that and Mavis' far- fetched dreaming.

Theron has the difficult role of making such a repulsive and mean-spirited woman, if not likable, at least, tolerable. She never tries to ingratiate herself. Instead, she depicts a mean girl caught in the throngs of arrested development and expects the movie audience to deal with it. Her acting choices work beautifully inside and out. Theron uses her expressive beauty and sexual allure to hide Mavis' twisted and unpleasant traits. Hopefully, this honest and compelling performance won't turn off Academy voters due to its nasty portrayal of its anti-heroine. It's a wonderful job of acting.

Oswalt gives a fully dimensional comic portrait of a small town loser type with bigger dreams. He's living with his sister. He's alone. He's Mavis' conscience and he's working overtime. He's the voice of reason ( and the sensible voice of the movie audience as well. ). Oswalt plays his character as an endearing slug, a man-child full of sage advice and bitter disappointment. It is a finely honed comic performance. 

Cleverly scripted, Young Adult is filled with smart one-liners that advance the action and are keeping with their flawed characters. Yet the film carries with it a more serious tone, not the laugh-a-minute movie one would suspect from the trailer. The characters and their situations verge on the real with the comically surreal. In an uncomfortable but pivotal scene, Mavis addresses Buddy's married life with consoling words and advice that " we can beat this thing together" and leave his KenTacoHut world behind. Cody's sharply observed and cynical view of small town life is imbued in her characters and may be distasteful to some moviegoers, although I found this film quite amusing and droll. The only objection to the film was in two of the film's final scenes ( which were effectively done but inaccurate to the characters' true motivations and actions).

Reitman is again drawn to damaged characters in his leading roles as he had successfully done with films like Juno and Up in the Air. He is relentless in his ability to make such complicated people completely fascinating as they free fall into despair. He makes their journey filled with ironic and satirical possibilities, making the negative positively comic in tone.

Young Adult resists the sweet rosy side of life. It humorously embraces the sad fatalistic notion of our everyday existence, supplanting upbeat and unattainable desires with a refreshingly downbeat sensibility. And that's seems very grown-up to me. GRADE: B+

When Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody struck gold with "Juno" in 2007, they did so with a rare combination of contemporary wit, quirkiness and heart. Their four-year reunion in "Young Adult" won't be nearly as heralded, but it might arguably be a better film. 

Although ironic when juxtaposed with its main character, a 37-year-old who hasn't gotten over her high school sweetheart, Reitman and Cody display obvious evidence of maturation. The subject and humor are decidedly darker, and the emotional energy more raw and challenging. 

Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, perhaps one of film's most hopelessly pathetic protagonists. Before giving the opening credit sequence its cue, Reitman puts Theron to work and paints a clear picture of spiraling drunken loneliness, reality TV and apathy toward responsibility. Appropriately, she's a young-adult fiction writer for a dwindling book series who's also a former prom queen. Theron is perfect for the role with her combination of in- concealable beauty and dramatic prowess. Mavis never becomes a caricature under her watch.

Unable to get past the fact that her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) just had a baby, Mavis flees her depressing cyclical lifestyle in Minneapolis for her home town of Mercury, Minn. with the intention of winning him back.

Mavis' delusional and deceitful quest to be a home-wrecker proves maddening through much of the film at the slow-burn pace Reitman has dictated, and it becomes obvious that at some point the bubble on her misguided journey will burst into an ugly mess. Yet despite this foreseeable direction, the climax proves stirring and not without a set of surprises.

Adding to the complexity of Mavis reclaiming her past is Matt (Patton Oswalt), a former classmate she barely noticed because they were miles apart on the social spectrum. The two bond over their appreciation for (or dependency on) bourbon, and their relationship allows Theron's character a chance to blow off steam, albeit irresponsibly. 

Mavis eventually remembers Matt as the "hate crime kid" because he was brutally beaten to the point of being disabled in high school at the hands of some jocks who thought he was gay. He serves as a strong comparison point for Mavis' high school experience throughout the film. Oswalt's wit also matches well with Cody's style and Matt actually turns into one of the better depictions of a disabled character probably ever. Other than the incident that caused it, we're not asked to sympathize excessively with his condition, nor do Mavis' snarky remarks about it come across as rude. 

Cody's dialogue is much more restrained this time around; "Juno" is eons funnier as a result, but the sacrifice of laughs allows us to focus on the film as a character study of a woman who hasn't quite learned how to be an adult. The script's only deficiency comes from a crater- sized hole in Mavis' history. "Young Adult" deserves praise for being a film about living in the past that contains not a single flashback, but knowing more about Mavis' divorce and how she came to break up with Buddy the first time could have significantly informed the story, especially as to why Mavis willfully lives her life as the trainwreck it clearly is.

The film's climax helps a bit in this regard, and Mavis' epiphany avoids being clich√© despite the obvious "appreciate what you have" motif. Part of the message oddly suggests that small- town folks lead purposeless lives for the sake of achieving some kind of blissful stasis, but at the same time the idea that all of us are broken people that need to affirm and trudge forward ¬ó not backward ¬ó with our various blemishes, will surely resonate.

Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody have been kind of hit or miss for me or at least that's what I like to think. I didn't enjoy Juno nearly as much as everyone else seemed to while Jennifer's Body, while not great, may have been better received on my end than what most give it credit for mostly because I have such a soft spot for horror. On the other hand though, Up in the Air was fairly fantastic all around. With that said, the main thing attracting me to Young Adult was the fact that Patton Oswalt had a rather big supporting role. Despite the fact that Charlize Theron has done so many things since and has won an Oscar, films like The Astronaut's Wife and The Devil's Advocate only come to mind whenever she's featured in anything which isn't flattering at all. So there was kind of this sense of dread going into Young Adult, but was it justified? The short answer is no, but it doesn't completely blow you away either.

There was an Entertainment Weekly article a few weeks ago where Theron said she aimed to not only be a mean-spirited individual, but also easily relatable as well. That's the trickiest part with a character like this. Anyone can be cold or act black hearted, but doing that while also displaying qualities that make you feel sorry for them and/or feel like something you went through in your life is something special. Imagining anyone else in this role is practically impossible, as well. The entire premise seems to be built around Theron. She seems to be playing herself or at least a slightly exaggerated version of how she is in real life. That more than likely contributes to the movie working as well as it does.

One of the other great things about the movie is that it's mostly unexpected. Young adult fiction writer Mavis Gary (Theron) currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota but decides to return to her small hometown of Mercury after receiving an email from her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) welcoming his first child into the world. Mavis somehow thinks that her and Buddy are meant to be together and despite Buddy being happily married and having a daughter that he loves dearly, Mavis thinks they can work past that to make things right between them. The outcome of the events is probably pretty predictable, but the relationships in between unfold in a way that you probably don't see coming. I'm mostly referring to Mavis and Matt Freehauf's (Patton Oswalt) friendship as it goes in a direction that feels far too human for such a superficial individual like Mavis. Oswalt also seems to be playing an exaggerated version of himself as well as he makes full use of his geekiness. The Pixies shirt was also a nice touch. But Young Adult is mostly entertaining due to the way it feels genuine despite revolving around somebody who is as harsh and selfish as Mavis Gray is.

Young Adult is very dark and downright bleak at times, but that's one of its most distinguishing traits. You'll more than likely find something to relate to in Mavis Gray whether it was you who was the popular kid in school, are just as depressed as she is, think you may be an alcoholic, or you're a writer, Mavis isn't really in the right frame of mind and maybe that's the most relatable part of her character. Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt share a kind of twisted chemistry that involves some fairly witty dialogue at times, but is mostly them dragging the other one through the mud with their words, which strangely only illustrates how miserable and similar their two characters are. Young Adult is a very fascinating dark comedy that is laugh out loud funny at times due to its cruelness, but shines thanks to its authenticity.

This is one of those films you read about and really look forward to; but, once seen, you realize that, while good, it's not quite worthy of the build up.

Charlize Theron is quite good and makes the most of the script she has to work with. As always, hers eyes, facial expression and body language all help her bring life to the role.

Patton Oswalt also does a star turn as a bit of conscience for Charlize's character.

The story is well told, albeit a bit of a stretch. For someone reaching back to her past for a lost love, Charlize's character is quite believable; it's her long ago beau, Patrick Wilson, that's not quite up to snuff. Given that these two play off each other for a great deal of the film, it would be nicer to have had a better performer opposite her.

That said, it's worth watching, though probably a bit depressing for many viewers.

If nothing else, 'Young Adult' is a breath of fresh air. Written by Juno creator Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman, YA is like a distant sequel - if Juno had moved to the city, got married and divorced and started drinking. 'Young Adult' is darkly funny, confronting, a bit depressing at times and has a refreshing sense of realism. It's not afraid to show broken characters battling their own demons and the mundane and sometimes bleak suburban existence.

Charlize Theron played Mavis, a relatively successful teen fiction author in Minneapolis who's reached a crossroads. Recently divorced and struggling to write her latest novel, she receives an email from her high school flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson) announcing his new baby. Mavis convinces herself that Buddy still loves her - despite being happily married to Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) ¬ñ and goes back to Minnesota to win him back. Along the way she meets Matt (Patton Oswalt), a short, fat, reclusive man still emotionally and physically scarred by a hate crime in high school, who was all but ignored by the younger Mavis despite being locker-mates. Despite her intentions for Buddy, Mavis and Matt bond.

The unlikely relationship between Mavis and Matt is, for me, is the highlight of the movie: Matt sees through Mavis' charade and isn't afraid to let her know about it, being downright rude at times, he's not the "Mr. Nice Guy" you may expect. The chemistry between Theron and Oswalt is brilliant. While they may be worlds apart socially and physically, their relationship is believable. After "uglying herself up" for 'Monster', Theron again eschews her glamorous image for the sake of a role. While Mavis is undoubtedly beautiful, she's clearly damaged and lonely, clinging onto an imagined ideal of happiness and completely ignoring reality. Her obsession with Buddy is demonstrated on her drive to Minnesota: playing an old mix tape in her car, she repeatedly plays the song that she and Buddy first made love to.

While 'Young Adult' may be a shock to some, that's what makes it so good. In a climate littered with clich√©d, paint-by-numbers rom-coms with nauseatingly happy endings, its refreshing to see a movie which tackles the darker side of life.

Young Adult is a very un-Hollywood comedy and a good thing it is too. I won't detail the plot as you can read this elsewhere but just to say that the writing is sharp and intelligent, the comedy nice and dark, the direction unfussy (so you don't notice it) and the running time just long enough so the movie doesn't run out of steam. There is no cute fluffiness (is that a word?) in this movie. 

Charlize Theron is quite brilliant (as she usually is) playing a very self centred character who is borderline stalker. Co-star Patton Oswalt is very good as the guy who had a bad break when younger who has had to learn to live with the life changing consequences. The rest of the supporting cast are great playing a mix of small town America characters. 

I seem to have a habit of watching movies in packed cinemas, no exception here as it was almost standing room only. This always helps with a comedy because once the laughing starts it spreads and continues throughout the whole movie. Highly recommended.

Young Adult is Diablo Cody's latest utterly refreshing attempt on the life of a once-famous high school queen who was facing challenges in her life. The renowned writer of Juno is making a entirely different attempt here by depicting a mid-life crisis of Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) and her return visit to her hometown where she lived when she was a teenager.

Mavis hated the town, hated everything about it, hated all the people in it, that was, except Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), who used to be her boyfriend. It didn't take her long to decide that she would return and rescue Buddy who she thought was a hostage in the deadly town with his marriage and newborn daughter. She would save herself from the disappointment from her life, save Buddy from the living hell, and picked up where things ended, once and for all.

And well, you expected it. Things were not as simple as that; they never are. So get ready for the adventure in this visit and get ready to know our Mavis better.

Charlize Theron totally manipulated the role of Mavis, letting the audience get to know who Mavis Gary really was as the events continued to unfold. It was a solid, realistic and Oscar-worthy performance that blew the audience away.

Young Adult is about life, about the past and the present, about why people are easily stuck in the past and do not see a future ahead of them. This is about why we should accept the present and look forward instead of always looking back. It is also more of a drama than a comedy but still it did give me some laughs.

Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) makes a living ghostwriting novels geared towards the tween crowd. They call this Young Adult Fiction ¬ñ YA in publisher's lingo. The books are part of a series created by another author. They were at one time incredibly popular. Now, the series has been cancelled. The book she's currently writing will be the final installment. Although she gets by financially, she does not live the glamorous life of a successful author. She lives alone in an unkempt Minneapolis apartment with her dog, an adorable Pomeranian, who she carries around yet doesn't seem to love unconditionally. One day, while rummaging through her e-mails, she comes across one sent by her high school sweetheart, who still lives in their small hometown, is now happily married, and has recently had a baby girl.

Mavis decides to return to her hometown and reclaim her lost love. His name is Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). It doesn't matter that he has taken his vows, and it matters even less that he's raising a daughter. She knows he isn't happy. How can anyone be happy living in a small hick town, despite the fact that it has expanded to include a KFC, a Taco Bell, and a Pizza Hut (all put under the same roof)? She understands that he has baggage, but she's willing to work through it with him. This has to work out, because in her mind, they were always meant to be together. Clearly, reality has not caught up with this woman. Emotionally, she was stunted as a teenager; to this day, she wakes up every morning with a hangover. She lives in a fantasy world in which love conquers all, as demonstrated by films like "The Graduate."

Jason Reitman's "Young Adult" was written by Diablo Cody, who, following "Juno" and "Jennifer's Body," shows yet again her affinity for adolescent characters in interesting situations. What makes this particular film noteworthy is that the adolescent is a woman in her thirties. On the basis of her binge drinking and stubborn refusal to let go of the past, Mavis has absolutely no desire to grow up. Hers is a world of impossible ideals. When she finally reunites with Buddy, it's at a Chili's-type restaurant; she would have preferred the bar they used to hang out at, but he's a father now, and he has to be home by a certain time. She makes herself so alluring that she looks strikingly out of place ¬ñ a slinky black dress with a low neckline, fancy jewelry, a neat manicure and pedicure, perfectly applied makeup, an attractive 'do enhanced by a hairpiece.

Buddy seems pleased to see Mavis, although there's no real indication that he's interested in running away with her to the city. He's a simple, small-town guy living a simple, small-town life. He loves his wife, Beth (Elizabeth Reaser), the drummer for a local girl band. He's devoted to his daughter. Why can't Mavis see that he's happy as he is? Keeping tabs over the situation is Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), who not only attended the same high school as Mavis but also had the locker directly next to hers. He now works as an accountant for the restaurant. She doesn't remember him until she sees him walking with a crutch; while still a teenager, he was beaten by gang of bullies who thought he was gay. It was considered a hate crime until he was discovered to be straight. It wasn't a mere schoolyard scuffle. His leg was shattered, and his penis was permanently damaged. He ended up missing six months of school.

Matt is in some ways just as stunted as Mavis. He lives with his sister, and he spends most of his time painting action figures. He brews his own bourbon in his garage, naming the label after the Mos Eisley spaceport in "Star Wars." Back in high school, he was never noticed. He was, to put it bluntly, a short, fat science fiction nerd. Mavis was, of course, hugely popular. That didn't stop guys like Matt from noticing her. Now he's seeing her at her worst. And isn't it funny that she's only noticing him now, when he's far from his best? He's certainly not at his worst; that would have been when he was first beaten. Even then, she never gave much thought to it. When she first speaks with him, she refers to him only as "the hate-crime guy."

One of the interesting things about "Young Adult" is that neither Cody nor Reitman go to great lengths to make Mavis a likable character. We don't especially sympathize with her from the start, and by the end, we've pretty much sided against her completely. We see right through her beauty. We might even take a little pleasure in watching it fade over the course of just a few days. At last, she looks as miserable on the outside as she is on the inside. Who does she think she is, coming into town hoping to destroy a marriage and family? How has she deluded herself into believing that she's trying to do Buddy a favor? The truth is, it has absolutely nothing to do with him. At a certain point, she's just going to have to realize that life doesn't follow the pages of a young adult novel.

It's hard to imagine just how the producers managed to convince anyone to back a script so irredeemably humorless, charmless and boring. One can only assume none of the money people actually read Diablo (Juno) Cody's screenplay - and believe it or not the direction was worse again: long pointless shots of the principal sleeping, waking, slobbing around her nondescript city apartment, shagging nameless strangers met online, shuffling and scowling thru car parks and department stores in her tracky-dacks and driving thru desolate urban landscapes . 

I found myself disliking Mavis, the principal character played by Charlize Theron - from the first shot. To suggest that her flaws were in any way a matter of immaturity - 'Everyone gets old. Not everyone grows up' - is an insult to young people and immature people everywhere. Not immaturity but apathy, arrogance, a puzzling sense of entitlement and just plain old self-centered meanness are the qualities that make Mavis singularly unattractive. I won't go into the plot, a flabby and pointless variation on the girl/guy who makes good in the big city and returns to their small town to find the one-that-got-away, other than to say that her lost love seems well aware Theron has schlepped into the wrong movie, giving Mavis the about-face quick smart and sending her on her way, much to the collective relief of everyone else in her home town. Apparently Mavis was a right royal stuck up b.tch at high school and had remained so ever since. At least she stayed true to herself.

My recommendation, in a nutshell, is don't touch this one with a barge pole. Seriously, do not be tempted- life is short, and you'll never get these 2 hrs back.

Oh- unless you're the sort of person who likes to laugh at people with disabilities. If you do, maybe you'll enjoy this movie, but judging by my fellow viewers' sighs and groans of disgust and disbelief you will be one of few.

PS Having written the above and then checked over the professional reviews on RT, many of which applaud the verite and real world honesty, I can only say that most reviewers neglect to mention that the movie is just not engaging.

'Young Adult' is the fourth feature of Jason Reitman, whose movies have always had a refreshing indie feel. When I look back to his filmography, I think they all have these protagonists who are in process of self- discovery. Over the course of events, they found the new one/lost one of themselves. 'Young Adult' also joins this culture.

Marvis Gary, played confidently by Charlize Theron, is an adult writer of 'Y.A. (Young Adult/Teen) Literature' living in a big city, far away from home for a long time. Her daily routine seems to be like all the lonely writers- writing, sleeping, eating, drinking, and then sleeping again. Course changes when she receives an invitation from her ex, Buddy, for a baby naming ceremony and then she is back, back to the memories of her 'glorious' past, as she likes to think of it. Marvis has always been a popular girl in high school, we learn that from numerous conversations. Now she is a struggling (her series is about to be canceled) writer living alone in a city and dealing with a recent divorce. It's no surprise that she wants to relive her popularity and more specifically, get his ex back. I think, because of living in this teenage world while writing literature and also having fame during here teenage, she's still stuck in that phase. She's still a 'young adult.' Which might be the reason why she still thinks that life can change the tracks and get her and Buddy back, like in the movies. We learn that Buddy is a happily married man and a father. And soon, over the course of events, Marvis also comes out of her illusion and teenage dreams and faces reality. Like I said, it ends with a self-discovery. 

Reitman knows what he's doing. Like all of his other movies, he doesn't try to stuff you up with heavy emotions. Even the most melodramatic events would be presented with a light and refreshing approach in his movies. That's where his vision stands out. And Charlize Theron does a wonderful job supplementing Jason Reitman's vision.

I guess I'm among the minority of professional and amateur critics in finding this movie utterly boring. My wife is among that minority as well. There was one dramatic scene that had me wake up momentarily, but both before and after it, I struggled to keep my eyes open - and we went to an early evening showing. Watching someone struggle with depression isn't particularly interesting unless said depression causes them to do something other than mope around for 90 minutes. I didn't find any of the characters likable, and the Patrick Wilson character was basically a contradiction, seemingly willing to participate in an affair one minute then completely insulted by the idea in another. Why would he even agree to speak privately with whatsherface at the party? It also made absolutely no sense that whatsherface was even invited to the party. Supposedly the wife did it as an act of pity, but she couldn't have possibly known anything about whatsherface's private life since it had been years since anyone had seen her (and there was no indication she had been tabloid fodder). And it also made no sense that whatsherface was suddenly confiding in a classmate she barely even noticed in high school some 20 years ago.

It's not often I come out of a movie feeling completely duped by the reviews, but this is one of those rare instances. I have no idea what anyone finds entertaining here.

I actually know at least a half dozen women like this, who are absolutely certain their best days came and went 20 years or more ago.

And the alcoholism, annoying provincial parents in denial, inner fantasy life, and stunted emotional growth are all way too familiar. It's sadly funny that her writing career feeds this arrested development in that she writes to an audience of emotionally immature teen girls. 

Too bad all the similarly afflicted women I've known could find a job that so matches their lack of emotional development as the lead in this movie has found. She uses her good looks to "get over" and to get away with more than anyone should ever be allowed simply because she's beautiful.

The last conversation with Sandra (Matt's sister) demonstrated that for every bitch beauty queen, there's at least one wallflower wannabee.

If nothing else, this movie does a good job of showing that you really shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.

I have a new rule. If Diablo Cody has anything to do with a movie, I don't see it.

I had a hint of her grating lack of depth when I watched the cut scenes from Juno. I thought Juno was passable but mostly for the performances. The DVD extras actually made me like it less and I only started with cool.

Ultimately, I found myself asking what the point was. If I'm going to watch a slow-paced drama/comedy I want to either laugh a fair amount or come away with an interesting idea. The movie was neither funny (I started to be amused by the guy in the theater who started heckling it, however) nor did it have any depth.

The point seemed to ultimately celebrate the demise of one of the beautiful people who many love to hate in high school-- as young adults. It seems born from the loathing one might feel when they run into the people who were popular in high school and still seem to believe somehow that their status remains intact-- the people who ride out their lucky hand for as long as they can while not realizing that they are stunted. But why celebrate? Worse, why celebrate while pretending to stand on higher ground? The movie is a very watery and even bitter stew. There was an attempt to sweeten it up with a tender storyline about a (fellow) loser who was actually physically hurt by a gang of the beautiful people. The character was contrived from empty platitudes and generalizations and accordingly wound up being flat and lifeless.

I often wonder if people feel a sense of duty when they say they like movies like this. It's like pretending to really like the food at a dinner party when the food is ambitious but ultimately boring.

Young Adult is an art film, in my opinion. I was confused throughout the whole movie. It did not make any sense. From the beginning of the film, I was disgusted by the main character. She had no life or morals. The basic plot of the film is that Mavis Gary(Charlize Theron) goes back home to reunite with her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade(Patrick Wilson). he is already married and has a baby on the way. Mavis ruins their baby shower and just creates drama in general. In the end, she just goes back to the city. There really was no purpose to any of it. The acting was okay. The cinematographer did not do a very good job. I would call it schlock film and would not recommend this film to anyone!

Seriously!!!!!!!!!!!! How can this movie be getting the average score it has? Sitting through this movie would have to be one of the most painful experiences I have had and is a portion of my life I would rather have back. The plot was so boring and slow and I actually found myself constantly checking the elapsed time the movie had been going as I just wanted the whole experience to be over! The story was lame and didn't go anywhere and I actually thought this title was supposed to be a comedy but it is far from ever remotely being funny. I enjoyed Up In The Air and haven't seen Juno but I'm sure Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody haven't struck gold with this release. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt that this movie was so bad I just had to get it off my chest.

One immediately recognizes "Young Adult" as a Diablo Cody script. This film belongs to her more than to Reitman. And that's a dual-edged sword.

"Young Adult" deals in trailer park sentiments (although Mavis' family is Midwestern middle class) played in an ugly urban landscape of dive bars and 'Kentacohuts'. Our recently divorced, depressed heroine hatches a plot to travel from Minneapolis (Cody's onetime residence) to her hometown, the fictional Mercury, Minnesota, to steal a happily married man (her hot, former HS sweetheart) from his wonderful wife. The couple's bliss is complete in their new child.

Her 'Sounding Board' (a Screen writing 101 plot element usually played by a same sex friend) is Oswalt. In HS he idolized Prom Queen Mavis (who ignored him), and was the victim of a nasty hate crime when Jocks, believing he's gay, pummel him with a crowbar.

Mavis holds the delusion her former flame (Wilson) is bored with small town domestic tranquility, and relentlessly pursues him until a spontaneous driveway intervention at the film's climax wakes her up. Kinda.

One edge of the aforementioned sword is that it's hard to like this film. Mavis, as written by Cody, has the appeal of a big bite on aluminum foil. Sadly, Mavis is drawn like the trailer park dwellers daily marched out by Springer. Theron plays the alcoholic, neurotic Mavis to perfection, but at the end she's still unlikable (even after a tender moment with Oswalt) as she drives back to 'Minneapple'.

Cody occasionally writes by stealth. In interviews, she's admitted to eavesdropping on and transcribing teen's conversations. As a writer of books for young adults, Mavis does as well. Such an obvious alter-ego crosses the fourth wall and is reason enough to dislike this film.

Cody's scripts are tight and well written yet paint-by-numbers in their tight grasp on American screen writing conventions.(Fairly, most Hollywood dreck uses the identical playbook.) The I'm-in-my-Thirties-but-still-cool-as-a-teen vibe is also an embarrassment.

There is something to be said for Cody's meditation on revisiting ancient regrets, grief and irrational jealousy. Many women might relate to the pain expressed in Mavis' barren womb (she miscarried Wilson's child during HS). This is the sword's other edge, but it's dull compared to the cut of the biting snark and unappealing lead character. Women should bristle at the portrayal of their gender in this slight twist of Cody's familiar coming of age stories. 

Cody shows contempt for the small town life she writes about. That makes "Young Adult" unpalatable and shifts viewer empathy to the self-loathing writer from where it belongs: story and character. Watch 'Juno" again.

I will start with the one and only positive to this movie; Charlize Theron portrays her character as a classical popular school girl who has no time for anyone except herself, who 20 years into the future ends up as a depressant alcoholic who lives purely in the past of her school glory days very well. However the main two issues with this movie is it's unbelievably boring plot and an even worst script. The plot consisting solely of Mavis Gray trying to win back her former high school boy friend, who is happily married with a new baby, drags so heavily and becomes utterly monotonous after the half hour mark. The script that Diablo Cody has created contains her attempt at humour which is best described as dry. Unfortunately it is quite apparent that Diablo Cody hasn't a single funny bone in her body as this movie fails to create any form of laughter at any point. There are moments that are actually quite offensive in which disabled people are mocked for the sake of it. And to top it all off Diablo decides to be clever going against the clich√© ending in which the nasty girl becomes a 'goody'. However all this does is leaves you deflated and curious as to the point of the movie other than to show us the life of a pathetic waste of space of a human being. If I had to use one negative comment about this movie though it would be BORING!

P.S if you watch this movie ask yourself if it felt like 1hr 30mins? I bet the answer is a lot more!!!

I wouldn't even give this a 1 if I didn't have to.

I believe in some point in a movie you should somehow connect with the main character...even if they are a bad person. Not even a little bit of me wanted this to turn out good for her. I would have rather seen her end the movie sad and depressed rather than uplifted.

This was a waste of my time. I was a big fan of JUNO and other movies by Diablo Cody and am disappointed that this came from her. She must have peaked at Juno.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Patton Oswald is fabulous and delivered his character well. You felt sorry for him but also hoped that he would get out of his funk. The story would have been better if he were the main character.

A movie for pseudo-intellectuals who think they are smarter than they really are.

The main character is despicable, there are no funny moments in this crap, and I only wish she has committed suicide at the end of the film...

She is only a pretty sick ans spoiled brat who thinks she can do anything she wants..

In the end she is only one pathetic person, like the film itself...

I'd rather hit a nail through my toe than watching something like that again...

In the 2000 movie "Nurse Betty" Ren√©e Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore and the film works as a dark comedy because Betty has lost touch with reality. This movie "Young Adult" did something similar for me. 

Charlize Theron is Mavis Gary, a ghost writer of young adult books. The series is winding down, in fact may be dead, but she is working on the last manuscript and is being hounded by the publisher for "pages." As she travels with her laptop, she is fond of creating dialog inspired by what she overhears around her.

Almost 20 years out of high school Mavis gets a birth announcement card from the couple that includes her high school romance, Patrick Wilson as Buddy Slade. Buddy has long ago left the memories of Mavis behind and loves his life as a husband and father. But Mavis (much as Betty Sizemore might have) decides that she and Buddy really do belong together and she will just drive down to the small home town in Minnesota and reclaim Buddy for herself. 

The third key character is Patton Oswalt as Matt Freehauf. He was the fat kid everyone picked on in high school, and apparently Mavis also gave him a very hard time which she either conveniently forgot, or in her skewed view of things rationalized that Matt deserved all the mistreatment he received. Even the beating by the high school jocks because they thought he was gay, a beating that left him partially disabled as an adult, and with a badly bent, partially functioning sex member. Mavis wonders aloud why he doesn't just get over it, after all it happened a long time ago.

Mavis is definitely not plugged in to reality, and for me this created a lot of laughs, the absurdity of the things she would do or say. She definitely had some serious emotional issues.

As most of us know Charlize Theron is a super actress, and I admire the range of roles she has created over her acting career. This is a good one to add to that list, she is superb. I was also impressed with Patton Oswald, his Matt made a very interesting odd couple with Mavis as she marched on in her misguided attempt at happiness.

Young Adult (2011)

Well, Charlize Theron is a terrific actress. That makes this enough to sit through, regardless of the dull overlay this whole thing has. It's meant to be a gritty look at a woman with some mild mental problems, a not so mild alcohol problem, and a failing career. Oh, and a fetish for a previous lover who has since moved on and had a child and a wife.

That's the main point of the plot--Theron's character is determined to win back this man, despite a million reasons she simply can't. Well, don't tell her that. A third major character has some presence and might actually save the movie (along with Theron), and that's a supposedly unattractive man (played by Patton Oswalt) who is a thorn and a conscience for Theron. It works. The overall sense is a woman outside her boundaries and a man, this old friend from high school, who is still suffering from an experience as a teenager.

If only the writing rose to the occasion. There are awkward lines of dialog, improbable turns of events, extended dramatic scenes that would certainly play out differently than they do, and actors (the husband mainly) who just isn't believable (he can't be that naive). The director, Jason Reitman is clearly talented--his "Juno" is a kind of masterpiece, for sure, and even "Up in the Air" has a nice feel to it. This one has potential but clunks along too often to make sense.

You might forgive the whole thing if there was a feeling of insight into this kind of malaise, about loneliness or substance abuse or even an obsession with someone you can't have, but it turns into twists and reactions that are made from movies and fiction, not from life. Or so it felt.

Canadian-American actor, screenwriter, producer and director Jason Reitman's fourth feature film which was written by American screenwriter and author Diablo Cody, was screened Out of competition at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in 2012 and is an American production which was shot on locations in Minneapolis, Minnesota and New York City, New York in USA and produced by Diablo Cody, Jason Reitman, Lianne Halfon, Mason Novick, Russell Smith and Charlize Theron. It tells the story about Mavis Gary-Crane, a 37-year-old female ghost writer for a young adult novel series called the Waverly Prep who lives in an apartment in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After receiving an e-mail from her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade and his wife Beth with pictures of their newborn daughter, Mavis interprets it as a sign that she and Buddy are meant to be together and decides to return to her hometown in Mercury, Minnesota with her dog Dolce.

Finely and acutely directed by Canadian-American filmmaker Jason Reitman, this quietly paced and engaging fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws an incisive portrayal of a somewhat conflicted woman's attempt to regain her first true love and her relationship with a bachelor who lives with his sister. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by cinematographer Eric Steelberg and costume design by costume designer David C. Robinson, this character-driven and dialog-driven comedy-drama depicts a nuanced study of character.

This darkly humorous and somewhat romantic story is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, colorful characters, quick-witted dialog and the poignant acting performances by South-African-American actress Charlize Theron and American stand-up comedian, writer and actor Patton Oswalt. A charming and commendable independent film.

I guess it's the kind of film you'd watch when there was nothing else on the TV, and i mean nothing! It was ridiculously boring and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It bares no resemblance to Director Jason Reitman and Screenwriter Diablo Cody's film Juno other than Juno is a film about a teenager that acts like a thirty something year old and Young Adult is a thirty something year old acting like a teenager. 

You could tell which parts were meant to be funny but it just didn't really work for me. The awkward sex scene was cringe worthy and served no real purpose to the film. When there was finally a bit of drama it fell into a bit of an anti climax. I gave it 2 out of 10 purely because the acting wasn't completely terrible. Charlize Theron managed to get one or too laughs, well just about. 

It was weird, but not good weird.
