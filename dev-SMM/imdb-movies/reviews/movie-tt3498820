### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
People says: an Avengers movie with 'emotional depth' and 'moral  complexity', and now I have to question what planet they're living on.  Seriously, WTF people!! if this is 'emotional depth' and 'moral  complexity' then Marsellus Wallace is a bitch!  
When their operation to stop the theft of a biological weapon in Lagos  goes explosively wrong leaving dozens of civilian casualties and  themselves under scrutiny. It may be that I'm misremembering, but were  there any civilian casualties in the past???  
Didn't whole cities go up without anyone even wandering around dazed  with a nosebleed? But the plot needs what the plot needs so now the  Avengers have always blown up innocent people, which leads to 100  nations gathering together and saying: this must stop. And: you must  all be brought under the control of the UN. 
While Iron Man is for it, Captain America, who is more Brexit, quickly  goes rogue and becomes a fugitive. This could have then set the scene  for, perhaps, saying something almost interesting about government  control, military might and divided loyalties, but instead it results  in all the superheroes choosing #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan there are no  takers for #TeamNeither, which would have been the sensible option  
WHY WHY they fight!! Come on!!!  
Captain America a rebel soldier???

The WINTER SOLDIER is the best MCU film, but its sequel has a serious identity crisis. 

Captain America: Civil War wants to be great. But for the most part it isn't. The film is an overstuffed 2 and half hour film that has one too many ideas thrown into the mix. It is essential a cash grab of the BVS variety. But why can't people see this? 

Now this is a Captain America as the title suggests. But in the end a more fitting title would read: Bucky VS Ironman: Dawn of who's the Captain's Bestie. The reason I say this is the film felt disjointed to the point of it being a joke. It felt like two separate films weaved together to try and make a film that makes sense. But it didn't It's one half a Captain flick/ the other half a mini Avengers film. But they both drown each other. 

It's clear this is a film Marvel wanted to make, but why on earth rush into it? One film could never service this iconic plot line. It should have been gradual, and while we did see Cap and Tony tense up in Ultron, this is where a strain in their relationship should have been definite and it should have still been in effect at the beginning of this film.

For the most part of the Airport sequence there was no real danger. It was a carefully orchestrated scene that showed these films are for young cinema-goers. Even when one character is looked to be written off "BAM" they are back, giving everyone some cheep laughs at the end of the film. 

Now from a writing and filmmaking point of view and dare I say it, this film has worse interconnecting scenes then The Amazing Spiderman 2. Re-shoots are obvious, editing is sub par, cinematography lacked style and was evident to be a "quick" point-and-shoot at the action affair. Such a disappointment. 

But yes this film has it's fun moments (the same can not be said for BVS). But they can't help a film tailored to a certain demographic that leaves out those looking for a film that doesn't kill a few braincell upon leaving the cinema. The laughs are hardly inspirational writing and forced, so forced.

sidetone: ONLY SOME OF THEM HAVE SUPER POWERS, SO WHY DO THEY ALL RECOVER FROM HARD HITS AND KNOCKS? it's just makes the stakes so much lower and less respectable.

this movie is so riddled with plot holes, flaws, horrible cgi and horrible jokes its ridiculous the more i think about this film the worse it gets and initially i loved it but man some of the stuff in this film can just not be excused from the horrible villain, the weak plot and character motivations i could go on and on all day. after how great the winter soldier was i thought this next cap would be next level especially with the russos at the helm and wow did it let me down A lot. just not a good film at all

okay all of zemos plans made no sense think about it how would zemos plan even work if falcon never told tony where they went? how and why was there a random camera in the middle of an isolated road in the tree line pointing directly across the road at more trees exactly where bucky killed tonys parents like come on? also bucky broke free of those restraints when he was getting interrogated by zemo why didn't he just cover his ears so he couldn't hear the trigger words? also how did zemo even get in there its a top secret government location not a nightclub a fake id isn't going to cut it the avengers and the government did no extra investigation into the sokovia accords bombing and just ordered a shoot to kill order off of a fake picture? . thats pretty weak for the avengers and the government. zemo is a flaw to me he is only used as a plot device no development what so ever and he is the key to everything happening he could've been great!! the cgi for spidey is horrible man but thats not a big deal to me but spidey ant man and hawk eye are so shoehorned in especially the 2 non avengers like think about it why are they even there? its just for the spectacle but makes no sense you're going to bring a brand new superhero who's 15 years old to a "war" (which it wasn't) and he didn't even need to be there. there's more and more i can keep going on about but they are all overshadowed and clouded by the action and jokes. it was a good film its just not as flawless as everyone is saying it has great action set pieces 10/10 but as a film story etc it isn't that good. i don't want to seem overcritical but thats how everyone was with BvS except i can explain their plot holes no one can explain mine yet﻿

that being said I'm very excited for the black panther movie directed by coogler so that looks like its going to be great because the character has great potential that goes for spidey too they just need to fix his CGI it was horrible in this film and he is one of my favorite character in pop culture period so i hope they do him justice

Captain America is only a stupid cowboy in this movie. Why does he not sign the regulation papers? He isn't a god like Thor or Superman. Who is Captain America to be above the Law? Superman or a American cowboy? Why did he not tell Iron Man what his best friend have done with H.Stark and his mother? Does he know how to talk with his friends like Tony? I think not. He only knows how to fight... like a perfect soldier...

And what about the conflict? And the consequences? Will we see them? Or Captain is already a friend for Tony? He has given a cheap cellphone to Tony... so... the conflict doesn't matter...

Only the action scenes are good...

I'm confused so much, all these movies sorta blend into each other. Since they are tied together. Hulk, Thor, Cap America, Iron man, etc.... Since the avengers were in this I assumed it was another Avengers movie.

But no it's Captain America: Civil War? Huh? Don't you need the Avengers for a civil war? What it being CIVIL and all. Umm....so confused.

Where is Thor and Hulk, and Loki and and and.....I can go on and on, but you get the point. We really know it was budget issues. They are IN the Avengers, SO why are they not asked to sign? ?????

Confusion. WHY do, ALL OF A SUDDEN, half the avengers seem not to trust Cap???? OH right since that is what the plot needed. This whole movie is just trash. Random spider man and ant man thrown in too, why not? Just whatever at this point. Explosions and random sh*t. Can anyone make sense of these movies anymore?

All started with Cap, the Nazis stole something from Thor/Loki....then he was frozen, woken up....umm Tony Stark's father knew Cap. Umm Cap almost banged Peggy? She did stuff created shield or something....then Hydra got in. Then Loki went crazy, and Thor stopped him, or didn't. Umm then Iron man made suits....Black widow wore tight tight clothes. She was in ballet??? Kissed Cap, but loves Hulk??? Umm....wtf is even happening any more. Robin hood has a secret family??? And who was that guy in a panther suit. RANDOM AS F***! LOL ?????

This review contains spoilers and my English is kinda bad.... so lets  start: After seeing 8.5/10 my expectations were really high but after  watching this movie i was so disappointed (probably the worst marvel  film since first CA what is really ironic since CA 2 was one of the top  three... )  
Story: story is meh, nothing special, just CA and his buddy (with  support of 1/2 avengers) against the world  
My PERSONAL problems with this film : 
1. Terrible villain again, didn't remember his name 20min after the  movie ended, did pretty much nothing but showed some amazing prophet  skills  
2.So many stupid things like how did villain know iron man will come at  the very end, how did he know nobody told iron man how his parents  died, also the big fight at the airport was just too dumb, pretty much  all mighty jean nm.2 and vision in the same fight where black widow and  hawk eye should just really be hoping, praying and dodging some random  explosions... this list could really go on and on  
3.SO OVERCROWDED. Why the hell did ant-man join the fight? What  is his motivation? How does random Nigerian prince have powers to fight  CA and bucky ? HOW ??? Nobody but CA, Iron man and bucky had story  behind them (pretty pathetic though),others were just useless guys  fighting. At least they didn't ruin Hulk even more :-) 
4.Really ? Tony tried to kill his friend CA and bucky and then after  being defeated he is f***ing cool with it? Best buddies again?  
5.In iron man 3 tony was able to call 30 auto iron mans to fight for  him, here he got challenged by a freaking falcon with his wings? Also  at the airport he was unable to defeat CA and at the very end he almost  rekt two of them ? ... Guess I'm back to stupid stuff... 
On the other side, good things: 
1.Spider-man - yea this kid with no story in movie at all was one of  few good funny things about this movie  
2.Cool fights right ? 
All in all , 4/10 (coz i love superheroes movies), 1/10 is to balance  things...

The story goes, Marvel runs out of ideas. They got excellent stuff shown in the first movie, then something lesser in the second one, and then the third one was like - somebody damn insisted on making it, even though there was no story written...

When the evil is all defeated, the continuation is not due till the next movie, and all avengers are simply bored, in the shortage of anything interesting going on, why not have all the heroes beating the crap out of each other? That should do the trick, and keep the sheep happy.

The movie has no story, its conflict is superficial and borderline idiotic, even for the way the avengers split into two groups had no logic in it, and, of course, no explanation. They just really wanted to flex their muscles, and so they did, period.

So the year of the big Superhero movies started so well with Deadpool and Batman v Superman, two movies I enjoyed very much, both different from one another and I felt delivered on what they were meant to be.

I was looking forward to Civil War a lot due to the love I have for Cap's previous movie, the Winter Solder. However, this film was a massive disappointment for me.

The film starts off in Wakanda where the Avengers have tracked down terrorists, led by Crossbones and as a result of the confrontation between the two groups, part of a building gets blown up and people die, which all of a sudden is a big deal. Due to that the government wants the Avengers to be reigned in an be controlled solely by the government, which Tony Stark is for (following a brief encounter with the mother of a dead child thanks to the Avengers) and Steve Rogers is against.

From there on, the film is mainly focused on Tony trying to get Steve to agree to the terms posed by the government, with no success until it all comes to a head once both Tony and Steve create their respective teams.

Marvel took a serious storyline in Civil War and just didn't know how to handle it in my opinion. It felt like the Russo's were caught between making a darker movie about a serious issue and making a light hearted comic book movie. In the end, we got a standard Marvel movie. Nothing different or ground breaking about it whatsoever... and its taken 13 movies to get to this point. It feels like the Marvel films are standing still and cannot progress to the next level, maybe in fear of the backlash from fans if they changed the formula.

What the movie does well is it showcases the arguments of both Toney and Steve well and you cant really pick a side of your own. However, we don't really get anywhere and by the time the famous airport scene comes about, you forget who's fighting for which team. Some heroes don't even know why they're there! It all felt very forced.

The action was great and so where the debuts of Spider-Man and Black Panther , however the whole movie could have been done without Spider-Man. He added no value to the story. The film had its standard levels of humour and whilst some of the comedy was done well, it went into overdrive once we had the inclusion of Ant-Man and Spider-Man.

The only part of the movie that was heart felt was the final scene between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky as you felt the heartbreak that Tony had at that moment - great acting from Robert Downey Jr. However, even that scene came about via coincidence, which was really the trend of this film.... everything that happened was coincidental, from Tony showing his younger self with his parents at the MIT presentation, to the video of Bucky killing Tony's parents.

Civil War was the wrong title for this movie. It should've been called, 'A Minor Disagreement'. All in all, the movie felt pointless as nothing was achieved by the end. Everyone remained friends and the only casualty of the movie was the least cared about character in War Machine. The movie just felt like a stepping stone to Infinity War and the solo Spider-Man and Black Panther movies.

No doubt that this will be praised by everyone and will make a ton of money, but as someone who appreciates movies, this one fell well short of the mark.

Just saw it. Not gonna go in depth but incoherent plot with lack of motivations for a lot of the characters to even fight to begin with. Didn't like the actor who played Spider-Man, his jokes were bad and misplaced in the middle of action scenes. Spider-Man seemed like he was added in at the last possible moment of production as he seemed out of place. I mean Tony Stark shows up and just blindly follows Tony. Black Panther was alright but oh boy does his mind change fast but like Spider-Man, he was shoehorned in. Ant-Man dragged along to be beside Captain America, he just blindly follows Cap.

Too many jokes in the middle of action scenes. Winter Soldier almost killed some of the Avengers but Captain Americas gay love for bucky blinds him from him. Captain America being so stubborn and showing his true colours as a terrible individual as he doesn't seem to care about anyone's safety. I thought Cap was suppose to be a leader but really, this movie only showed lack of leadership skills as he almost got everyone killed.

The highly praised airport fight was not impressive. I'm not sure what people saw here. Zoomed-in action scenes, close up to the faces, lame jokes in between, Black Widow asking if were friends to Hawkeye, camera shaking. The heroes just scatter/disappear and end up on the raft?.

Terrible pacing from one scene to the next. Captain America just having a casual talk with Spider-Man while they are fighting and you can see Evans laughing after he mentions that he's from Brooklyn ugh. So bad and so cheesy. Cap holding the helicopter ugh so cheesy.

They say bucky is brainwashed but in some scenes, he seems to have it together but in other scenes, he don't. If he is brainwashed, why does Zemo need to activate him when he says the code?. After Zemo says the code, he almost killed some of the Avengers but later on, he fights alongside them?. And now he has it together or what?. Is he brainwashed or not, what's going on here?. Why is he back and forth on killing the Avengers and then working beside them?. Ugh so awful.

Chris Evans wooden acting. Lack of facial expressions for the intense moments of the film. Captain Americas lame letter to Tony Stark.

All these Marvel movies and they still can't make War Machine the true badass he is like in the comics. The character has been under utilized since Rhodes has put on the suit. They made him a laughing stock in Iron Man 2. The character has very little screen time in every other Marvel movie. Absolutely awful how they treated War Machine in this movie and previous movies. Terence Howard should be happy that he's not playing this character anymore. Disney/Marvel made him a joke.

RDJ as Tony Stark/Iron Man is fantastic as always. No complaints here, his motivation for killing Bucky makes sense here. Captain America protecting bucky nope other then that they are friends from back in the day.

A lot of the faults people give to BvS which are warranted is also in this movie Civil War. This is not even a Cap Movie, it's a Avenger movie. It's a overcrowded mess with too much going and too many shoe-horned characters and too many characters lacking any real motivation for even fighting each other.

I could go on about why I think this is the worst Marvel film to date. I'm not sure what critics saw here. I rated it a 1 as a place holder and reserved judgement until I saw it. I finally saw it. I'm leaving it at a 1/10. An absolutely awful dreadful film that's only to please the fanboys and children.

So Disneys: Marvels: Avengers: Captain America: Civil War was basically a pile of garbage. The fight scene with Spidey and Ant Man and the introduction of Black Panther were the only real redeeming factors.

It failed as a movie and it failed as an adaptation of the comic series. One thing that really made me think that it failed as an adaptation is that while I sided with Stark in the comics, I can't help but to side with Captain America in the movie. If the adaptation was even vaguely faithful or decent my opinion should have stayed unchanged.

But ignoring the original work, because the movie has to be judged on its own merits as well, it was pretty darn bad. The funeral scene was so cheesy, out of place and just bad that I actually briefly considered walking out. I couldn't believe I'd spent so much money to see this movie at the theatre.

My opinion of this movie would probably be quite a bit better if they actually had the guts to kill off a single character in Civil War. When nobody is going to die and we all know it, all the drama and suspense are just instantly gone. It immediately goes from watching a tense battle sequence that could change the whole cinematic universe to a pretty light show.

And the big climactic battle between Iron Man, Captain America and Bucky in Civil War was so dark you can't tell what's going on for half of the scene. That is a cardinal sin in film making. If you can't tell what the heck is happening, the scene is pointless and uninteresting.

I obviously have a lot more gripes with this 250 million dollar mistake but I don't feel like writing an essay and nobody would read a review that long and detailed anyway. It would probably take longer for me to explain all of the issues I had with the film than it would for you to just watch it and decide for yourself, but I can't say I'd recommend doing that.

This is perhaps the worst entry into the MCU, barring only The Incredible Hulk. This movie was so bad I'd even rank it under Thor 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger in the ever-growing list of Marvel missteps.

The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited "Civil War". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.

"Captain America 3" starts off where "Avengers: Age of Ultron" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.

It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in "The Winter Soldier". Though "Civil War" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.

Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.

For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, "Captain America: Civil War" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's "Spider-Man".

Once again, The Russo's have proved their prowess in making excellent superhero films. The story was magnificent! Each character had their own little arc for them to develop in, unlike in most movies, where too many characters means little development for other characters, but this movie pulled it off with grace! And let me say that airport scene, and any other action scene in this film, OH MY GOD! The choreography was spot on. Every fight has emotional depth. I can feel myself almost crying at some points. And SPIDERMAN! This Spiderman was the best Spiderman and the best Peter Parker I saw on screen to DATE! And Black Panther, I haven't forgot about him, he was great too! This movie is just so near perfect, it's unbelievable. And now let me address all those fanboys calling me and other reviewers Marvel biased fanboys for giving this movie a high score. IT DESERVES IT. This was a payoff of 8 years of hard work. It's everything Batman v Superman isn't.

So in concusion. It was Amazingly, Spectacularly Great. 10/10 would see, would see again, would buy, and would die for. Thank you Russo Brothers, for bringing my childhood fantasies to life.

You might wonder at first why I rate this movie with 1. Read the whole review and then later you'll find out why. So, without further due let me tell you my opinion about this movie.

The bad: I found very convenient that the main idea of the Avengers having to answer for their casualties right in this movie where the main theme is civil war or a war between friends as we see later in the movie. And it's very dull in my opinion that this idea is only exploited right now, and it's sole purpose is to serve the plot and make you believe the plot. But here's the problem: why wasn't this idea exploited in the previous movies, and why are the Avengers only now regret failing to save people(as you'll see in a scene at the beginning of this movie) but never shown any signs of remorse after failing to save thousands of people in Sarkovia? I'll tell ya, they were to busy saying one-liners. Again it's so predictable and dull, that only movies like Taken 2 or Transformers might have it. Next there are minor mistakes like a scene where a man is drown and as he hangs upside down his head is introduced into a vessel of water clearly his nose is above the water level, but then as he is left do drown, his body doesn't drop yet his nose is somehow under water just so he could, die(maybe cinema sins or ScreenRant might help here). Next, when Spider-man does an Empire Strikes back move on a giant ant-man, his web seems to never end although he circles him countless times, and so on, I could try to remember as many flaws like this ones, but that's not my point. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is more predictable than Batman v Superman was, but that movie had some twists and moments that I never expected and gave the feeling of watching a comic book movie, while this movie is more about a real life situation that would imply superheroes, but that's not a very accurate comic book adaptation but is rather a "what if there were superheroes in real life" situation, and quite honestly I don't know which side people are on... but whatever, moving on... The humor again was sometimes very badly placed in scenes where there was fighting to the death, I mean come on, as a real person in a real life situation(as this movie suggests) you wouldn't make jokes, would you? And last but not least, the 100+ nations gather way too easily. If it was a real world, things wouldn't be that simple. 

The good: Oh, yeah, you knew this was coming... Spider-man for me was like Batman in BvS, extremely well adapted from the comics. It took the best out of the two previous incarnations. It took the genius and nerd attitude from Tobey's Peter Parker while being funny and very talkative like Andrew Garfield's Spider-man was. I absolutely loved it and he made the movie worth seeing after all(can't wait for his solo movie). The action and the way movie was proceeding was good, as fast as BvS might say, but clearly the plot was made on the way, and the conflict wasn't very well developed, while neither BvS did a better job but in that case the plot started from things we already knew from Man of Steel while this one introduces new things and memories just to serve this movie's plot, while being no other clue of them appearing in other Marvel movies before this one. The fights were beyond awesome, very realistic and very real life street fight made like, unlike BvS where the fight scenes were more comic book style, but should either of these two different styles bother you? It's up to you to decide. The humor even though at times was badly placed, sometimes was very well placed in scenes that needed humor to make them memorable(and of course many of these were made by Spidey) At times it was very sentimental and very emotional, but I don't understand how critics see only these things and don't see the bad ones I wrote above. I hope some of you will agree with me, but remember this is a subjective opinion, although I tried to be as objective as I could.

So, to wrap up this review, I'll say this: This movie is a strong addition to the Marvel universe, and typical for their style of movie making. I enjoyed it, even though I was offended to see that the critics are praising this movie so much, and reviewing BvS so badly, which in my opinion is not objective(since this is the role of critics, to objectively review a movie). So this is why I vote 1 for this movie, because it's rating here is hugely overrated, and IMDb seems to be on the side of critics(but I'll not enter in the way they calculate the rating).This movie's real rating should be around 7-8, probably the same like Age of Ultron, but until it gets there(which probably won't happen), I rate this movie with 1.

So saying that this movie is a masterpiece is like saying Taken 2 is a good movie. Maybe this movie is a masterpiece, but only compared to a movie like Batman vs Robin, although there are movies like the Dark Knight trilogy and Watchmen, OR Iron-Man(since we're talking about Marvel here) that are comic book movies masterpieces. OK, I'm done now :)

Superheroes may misunderstand and they make mistakes but, ultimately, they are morally incorruptible. If they find themselves on the wrong side of a fight it's because they've misunderstood the nature of the problem. However, when reality finally hits home we can rely on them to admit their error and go off to fight together in the name of Truth, Justice and the American Way. People who die are unavoidable collateral damage, superheroes are beyond reproach and we need them too much to limit their powers. The world is just too scary and too dangerous to shackle the mighty with red tape and bureaucracy. Superheroes are better than us mere mortals, not just more powerful but also more moral. They don't need to follow the same rules we do.

After Winter Soldier I was under the (apparently mistaken) belief that Marvel's Capt. America franchise was criticising neoliberal America. There was all that stuff about the ends not justifying the means and about how politicians use terror to convince the population they need to be oppressed for their own good. How wrong could I be! Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt. America criticises the State for oppressing people whilst simultaneously adhering to exactly the sort of high-handed moral superiority that inevitably leads to that oppression. He (I mean Capt. America) obviously skipped school on the day they taught the importance of checks-and-balances and why one of the central principles of US Democracy is that of the separation of powers.

The message of this film is simple. If you believe you are right, then you can do whatever you want as long as it's in the name of *insert moral cause*. Anyone who tries to limit your personal crusade is either stupid, naïve or oppressing you. Freedom from oppression means the freedom to act like you're better than other people, because, well, you ARE better than other people (go on, admit it, you're amongst friends here).

It is overstuffed(in order to be very good) and repetitive like other avenger movies and has a serious identity crisis. Apart from cinematography and action everything else is pathetic, It is more suited to children, people with fully evolved minds would find it absolutely boring and this is the trend now with all the superhero movies which have everything stuffed in them except a story(forget about being a decent one),The main problem with captain America is stuffing every superhero on earth, i think a superhero movie should be about one super human being who realizes that he has powers and uses them to do good for the mankind,but here u have a no. of superheroes (who sometimes fight among themselves) and only a poor solitary villain which makes the movie that much less interesting due to lack of power balance between the villain and hero.Any normal guy would have a perception from the start that "there's no way this villain can save his ass from these many SUPERheroes".

Went into this with high expectations which weren't met. Most of the film has the Avengers fighting each other, with themselves being the bad guys. Lots of phony CGI action, lots of preaching about how bad the Avengers are because some innocent people got killed while they were doing their thing. Most of this film was boring, as I had a real problem suspending my disbelief. Seems like the social justice jerks made this film.

Toward the end I couldn't see how any happy ending could take place, and there wasn't one. Maybe if there's a sequel the Avengers will be friends again, but I'd much rather not have spent all this time waiting for something that didn't happen in this film. This movie tried to be a drama instead of an action movie, but that's not what I wanted to see. 

If you really like watching the heros beating each other up and spending lots of time in jail, you'll like this film. If you like lots of agonizing over broken families, you'll like this film. If you think the collectivists at the UN ought to keep the Avengers in line, you'll just love this film. Oh, and there's physical therapy for broken Avengers, ain't that just grand.

I thought this movie sucked. There are lots of things that would be more fun than this film: hitting yourself with a hammer, running headfirst into a wall, or tearing off your fingernails with pliers come to mind. Any of those things would be preferable to watching this lousy movie again!

As a big comic, superhero and film fan I was really excited for this film.

Oh dear.

It's a mess.

The first 30 minutes is boring, nearly left at that point. Baron Zemo is a terrible villain, is less than one dimensional with the on screen presence of a bag of rice.

So Tony and Steve has a political disagreement... no problem thinks Tony, I can sort this out by blasting my best friend in the face with high powered explosives! Why exactly were Ant Man and Spider-Man joining the fight? Fun as a Spider-Man's scene was it was a lame introduction and nothing more than Marvel screaming "LOOK! WE HAVE SPIDER-MAN!" And if the Avengers are having this debate surely Jenny, a.k.a She-Hulk, would be there being as she is a lawyer. Oh yes, can't have too many female characters unbalancing the precious testosterone driven MCU.

I don't know about this being Captain America 3, it was more like Winter Soldier 2, a character I'm not keen of to begin with, so it was annoying to have this character take up yet another film.

The final fight between Cap & Tony also made no sense. Tony knows Bucky was under mind control and not a murderer yet he still goes off on one, rounding off a truly badly written story.

And now the Avengers are no more. Oh great, now the next film will have to spend half an hour bringing them all together again.

Overall it was a huge let down. So much so it really has tainted the whole Marvel universe for me. Oh well I guess I could read the comics... wait... Thor is a woman, Iron Man is a girl and Bruce Banner is dead... Marvel have lost the plot in a BIG way.

I would give it 0/10 But had to settle for the lowest which was 1/10. This movie is as inconsistent as it is poorly written. Black Widow survives being thrown in a armored truck with a grenade, not to mention no one even bothers to shoot at her. 

The scene where Scarlett Which blows up part of a building was ridiculous, out of all the places she could've chosen to throw the bomb it was at the one tall building in the area. Captain America freezes due to hearing the name Bucky and even says that. The scene where Black Panthers Dad dies is ridiculous given that Black Panther should've been killed in the blast, not to mention how was that part of the building the only part that suffered the most damage? I guess they didn't want to kill off Black Widow. The explosion would've leveled the lower floors thus resulting in the higher floors crumbling. Not just that one room being majorly affected. 

Tony Stark is the only one in this that makes sense. Everyone complains about Tony and says he's the bad guy and will stab you in the back, when they are the one's who broke the law and have a cry about it. Scarlett Witch being "rescued" by Hawkeye was completely ridiculous, she has a guilt trip about killing people and she snaps out of it just because she is told to get up off her ass. Not to mention Tony just grows a conscious after a few years of all these other people dying but changes his tune after talking to a Mother. Jokes are forced.

Lets not forget how bad the reasoning for their fighting is. Captain America especially, Bucky being a trained killer, who would be out in public and he thinks it's a good idea to break him out and beat up the German police. Also the part where black Widow goes off at Tony for things getting out of hand and that Captain America will always be on the run and she let Captain America go. This is why the Avengers can't have nice things.

CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS What kind of movie was that,I couldn't stop laughing either due to jokes or sarcastically due to the ridiculousness of the scenario! In a way that was anticipated.The directors,the Russo brothers, have made some good comedy around.In fact I would say that if you really like 'Community' , you're going to love that movie,even a lead actor from Community plays there (small role) and you can sense the similarity to the humour But that wasn't enough.You also have Bilbo Baggins,the guy from Goodbye Lenin & Marisa Tomei!In a superheroes movie about Civil War!!! Therein lies the problem of the movie.It's tone.It changes from serious to laughter in almost every scene,all the time As for the serious part,let's just pretend it's not there,then you can enjoy the movie! First of all it's not a Civil War,it's 12 guys fighting in a parking lot(or airport) and when the actors talk seriously,they have to wear sunglasses or behave like robots The fight scenes? Amazing but over the top The scenario? Cap seems constantly to convince Iron Man that he is either misinformed(Is Bucky terrorist) or overreacting(Did Bucky kill my parents) and that's why they fight!!! The evil guys? Zemo was totally lame and no nerve.Crossbone was decent The new good guys? Spiderman & his aunt are out of space/time.It will make you wonder who made those choices if you know how these characters were depicted in previous movies..Spiderman is totally dis-likable , but hey he does make you laugh! Black Panther was awesome , but he was lame when he was showing his panther claws Matching to Comics: Hellll no!!! Captain America does not even die,no lead actor gets killed.Simply told,Disney shouldn't have called it Civil War On the positives as I said before,you laugh a lot,there is plenty action with lots of established superheroes As a movie it was worse than Avengers,worse than the previous 2 Captain America films,maybe a little bit better than the Age of Ultron,but for different reasons.And to mention the 2016 competition Bvs had its flaws, but it was much more serious and consistent.Civil War feels like the horror/comedy movies where you know in advance that you can't take it seriously in order to enjoy it! Disney craps all over Marvel again..

1st, Civil War is basically a copy of BvS. A government building gets blown up by a bomb, killing a prominent government official. A villain manipulating heroes into fighting.

2nd, too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and just shoehorned into the movie - Ant-Man/Giant Man - Black Panther - Hawkeye (was retired, now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities) - The Annoying Spider-Kid (more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace; did more talking than fighting)

3rd, after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes, those issues were completely trivialized by a "big fight" that was nothing more than a friendly sparring contest with bad one-liners thrown in: "Are we still going to be friends after this?" "We haven't met before?" "Mr Stark. What do I do now?" "You have a METAL arm?" "I'm from Queens. I'm from Brooklyn."

Was the "Civil War" supposed to be a real fight for something they believed in, or just a "Joke-Off" to determine who could deliver the best jokes?

4th, MCU fans had been saying for months that Captain America was justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he didn't want the Avengers to be controlled by HYDRA. But it wasn't HYDRA who requested the Sokovia accords. It was the United Nations.

The Avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the United Nations wanted oversight of the Avengers. But Captain America didn't want the Avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused.

Captain America wanted the Avengers to be the supreme authority (exactly like Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein made themselves the supreme authority) to make decisions on what's best for the people instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make decisions on what's best for the people (like the way a Democracy works). So basically, Captain America opposes Democracy and favors Tyranny.

5th, plenty of plot holes and lazy, contrived writing. Tony Stark had called Secretary of State Ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big fight. So Ross knew before the big fight that the Captain America and the Bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport.

So why didn't Ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane? There's already a "shoot on sight" order for Bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a plane, then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane.

Since Captain America and Bucky can't fly on their own, their powers are useless when they're inside a plane being fired upon by military fighter jets. And their plane wouldn't be able to evade military fighter jets. But the script needed Captain America and Bucky to escape so that it could set up the final fight between Iron Man and Captain America.

Also, the 1st half of the movie is all about Tony Stark trying to get all the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which state that the Avengers would operate only when approved by a UN panel. Then in the 2nd half of the movie, Tony recruits Peter Parker to join his team even though Peter is a minor and wouldn't be able to sign a legal document and thus wouldn't be approved by the UN panel to operate under the Sokovia Accords.

Another egregious error is that the whole movie set up Bucky as the killer of Iron Man's parents, thus setting up the main conflict in the movie, but why would there be video footage of their accident on some random back road in 1991? And how did whomever filmed the video footage know to place the camera at that EXACT spot where their car crashed, and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed?

If there was video footage, then wouldn't Iron Man or Jarvis or even Ultron have stumbled across it by now? Tony hacked classified government networks in seconds in Iron Man 2, hacked Shield in The Avengers and has apparently been watching Peter Parker on a regular basis. Seems like he would have found video footage of his parents' deaths a long time ago.

And better yet, how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident when the ligature marks around Maria Stark's neck and the fist imprints in Howard Stark's face would have been immediately evident in the autopsy? Was the coroner just incompetent?

Also, Tony Stark believed his parents died in an accident and never suspected foul play at all. So how did Zemo know that their "accident" from 25 years ago was actually foul play? How did Zemo know there was video footage from 25 years ago of Tony's parents being murdered and how did Zemo find that footage when Tony never knew about or found that same footage?

Tony Stark was more angry at Steve Rogers because Steve knew but didn't tell him. So how did Zemo know that Steve knew the "accident" 25 years ago was actually foul play?

Those are massive pills we're asked to swallow that exist only because they conveniently set up the final conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Now that's some mighty contrived writing.

6th, another forgettable MCU villain. Zemo was about as invisible in Civil War as Luke Skywalker was in The Force Awakens.

7th, critics and haters of BvS complained about how Lex knew Superman is Clark Kent and how Superman knew Batman is Bruce Wayne, but there was no explanation at all for how Tony Stark knew Spider-Man is a high school kid in Queens.

I remember in 2002 when I saw, at the time, a DVD of the Spider-Man on display at a DVD rental store, the first one with Tobey Maguire. I looked at it and decided not to get it, because I thought that there were already too many super heroes' movies. But, eventually, the movie found myself couple of years later, and when I watched it, I took my thought back, because of the brilliant script of the movie, which would keep the same strength in the two Spider-Man movies that followed it. Then it came the new Batman in Batman Begins in 2005, which was also superb and that also brought legendary sequels. The same can be said about the Iron Man films. Those movies where not only about the action: there was emotion and plenty of it, romance, life, creativity, intelligent crime plots and many other qualities. The narration on the first Spider-Man says beautifully that "this, like any story worth telling, is all about a girl" - simply superb, something that was totally lost through the years, because suddenly, it all became to crumble. When the first Spider-Man came out without the original actors, I watched, and it was like watching a two-hour action sequence with no spirit; it was just the action. Then other superhero movies started to come out in the same note: just action; emotionless action. Then the superhero leagues movies came, and together they couldn't bring a single tear to an eye anymore. So they made them fight against each other now. And today, I wasn't even gone through an hour of this film, Captain America: Civil War, and I was already tired of so many action sequences under a shallow, only elaborated, story with no emotion whatsoever; robotic action with no feeling or spirit. Even the actors seemed to be acting mechanically, maybe because even they are tired of it. The story breathed a little after an hour and the part where Stark recruits young Spider-man is the best scene of the movie in my opinion. The part where they all fight against each other is not completely bad either. However, it wasn't enough to save the movie; it only made it bearable and a little more entertaining. Well, now I guess I can really say that there are today too many superheroes movies, and sadly, not because of how many they are, but because of how poor they've become. The theme in superhero movies nowadays circles only about the conflict in whether superheroes are for our protection or a threat, heroes or villains. Seriously, after this one, I don't think I'll be watching another superhero movie until another one stumbles at me and turns out to be worth watching.

Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, "Civil War" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after "Age of Ultron". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.

In "Civil War", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.

Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier now simply, Bucky Barnes is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.

While Joss Whedon's "Age of Ultron" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity. 

Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.

A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.

Did not watch C.A. movie for a while, and watched winter soldier on my flight home in August. Thought it was good, so today finally I got my eyes on the Civil War. 10 minutes into the movie, I started to think: hmmmm, WTF!!! Don't remember any notations about Avengers being accused of killing innocent people, and after one incident in Africa, there are 117 nations jumping up and down trying to *contain* avengers. Really? A sequence of events was brought up by Secretary of State, citing their killings. OMG, they are blaming casualties on avengers because they were fighting invading aliens? So if they didn't do anything, those people would have lived? Sokovia casualties are all avengers because they were trying to fight Ultron? They would have lived if they didn't interfere? I thought Ultron was gonna drop that big piece of rock like an asteroid. No? I get it. Some people, especially those have loved ones lost in those events may think that way. But the majority of people with logical mind? Not to mention when did US government give a damn about what any other country feels? And my good old Tony, the arrogant, the narcissistic, the I-know-all, billionaire suddenly felt the devastating pain of a mother because her son died in an action sequence and he felt he had to put himself in check. What? And as soon as the conflict shows up among all the superheros, they split into two radically opposite sides like a TNT explosion. And they have to fight each other so hard, but with constraint because nobody should die in this movie. They are so sophisticated in their fighting that they have perfectly contain fights among themselves in a small secluded place. How considerate! Rationally I'd side with C.A. But WTF are you guys fighting for? Especially those two insect-men. When did you have anything to do with any of those things? Super dumb war. Don't remember where I saw this, but someone noted: Cap America won only because this movie is called "Captain America".

Stupid, stupid movie.

The Bad: For those of us that were fans of the comic book, there was a bit to be disappointed with. Captain America was always the liberal super hero, the one the protested Nixon, that protested Regean, and that led a Civil War under Bush. Sure it was all thinly veiled in comic book style, but everyone knew what he was doing, everyone knew what it meant.

He was Iron Man's political foil.

And then there was the epic feel of the Marvel Civil War, we wanted a movie that didn't start and end with Cap, but effected at least a movie per character in the MCU.

Then there was the Black Panther. He is supposed to be cold, calm, logical. In the comics you got the feel that both you and Panther knew that he was smarter than you are. In the movie he was driven by revenge. It was a disappointment. We wanted the Black Panther to act like the Black Panther.

Not to mention, especially in 3D, some of the scenes were jumpy.

The Good: It felt like another Avengers movie and that is not at all a bad thing.

Anthony Mackie got a lot of screen time and, I may be in the minority here, especially since his Falcon has diverged so much from the comics...but he does an excellent job in his role and deserves a Falcon movie of his own.

The MCU got Spider-Man back and, after Andrew Garfield's depiction of a Spider-Bully, it seriously needed a reboot. It's hard to surpass Tobey Maguire. For a lot or people he nailed the role...until Tom Holland took over and became the best Spider-Man yet to grace the silver screen.

Ant-Man returned. It wasn't as shocking as the fact that Paul Rudd is a super hero, but it's a welcome addition. He brings a sense of humor to the role and even in a small part he's a pleasure to watch.

And then we have the story itself, it didn't have the wonderfully tight beauty that Winter Soldier had, but that is excused. Civil War was really an Avengers movie and one that brought the MCU together again. It was a fun ride and it gave you the sense that the MCU is expanding faster than the big bang.
