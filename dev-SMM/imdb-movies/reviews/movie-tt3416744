### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Prior to seeing this film, I had limited knowledge of David Foster Wallace and his works. After seeing the film, I wanted to learn more. The End of the Tour (dir. James Ponsoldt) is a very reflective film, highlighting author Wallace on the last stretch of his book tour for his novel Infinite Jest. Our entry point into this intriguing man is David Lipsky, a Rolling Stone reporter hired to do a piece on him in the late 1990s.

What little there is of plot is made up for in excellent characterization. The film is really all about existentialism, and thankfully it never leans towards pretentiousness. Rather there is an air of optimism about making your time on earth worthwhile. Wallace and Lipsky in a way represent two extremes of existentialism. Wallace is very relaxed, and takes his newfound celebrity with a grain of salt, while Lipsky is very Type-A, yet never brash or irritating. Lipsky has been trying to get his foot in the door as an author for a while now, while Wallace almost became famous overnight, and the film plays with the concept of "fame" in fun and unique ways. Through the film, Ponsoldt is able to explore these two extremes and find common ground between them, all while touching on the idea of fame and what it means to different people.

The script is outstanding, and hits all the right notes I touched on above. The dialogue between Lipsky and Wallace feels natural, nothing is forced. I wonder how much improvisation was done for the film, because the two seem like good friends from the moment they meet. There is a natural chemistry that draws these two characters together, and it's outstanding to watch on-screen. It's difficult to adapt a book like Lipsky's, which is mostly interviews and recording, as the book was published after Wallace's death in 2008. But screenwriter Donald Marguiles makes it work, and the result is an insightful, often hilarious film.

All this talk about chemistry would be a waste if it weren't for Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg as Wallace and Lipsky, respectively. Segel is a marvel as Wallace; it's a performance that doesn't demand much, yet Segel taps into all of Wallace's nuances and quirks. His delivery, cadence, and warmth almost makes it feel like you're talking to an old friend. It's a subtle performance that I hope is remembered come awards season. Eisenberg, too, is great. His reporter-type isn't very developed until the middle-end of the film, and he might come across as annoying for some. But he makes Lipsky tick as the curious interviewer wanting to learn more. He's driven by his desire to success, his want to make a successful piece for Rolling Stone, yet he ends up with a lot more.

The End of the Tour is a huge success. It isn't a very showy film, without much in the way of technical prowess, yet it's a talker. The realistic dialogue and blasé tone make the film feel like a 140 minute hang out with two good friends. Ponsoldt keeps a tight grip on the film's themes, never letting one overpower the film's true intentions. It's a wonderful ode to Wallace, and a funny one at that.

Saw this film last weekend at its world premiere at Sundance. First of all, Donald Margulies' script was fantastic. I am slightly partial to good writing in film, so perhaps that's just what stood out to me, but the dialogue is incredibly well-written and natural and at least generally captures David Foster Wallace's fascinating way of talking. In essence (and in the best of ways), nothing really happens in this movie. There isn't a lot of high stakes drama, but that's exactly what makes it so compelling. It's like we as the audience get a glimpse into two men struggling with the same ideas about life, art, expression, addiction, culture, and depression. 

Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg live up to the task of interpreting the script, helped along the way by director James Ponsoldt. The direction is simple, and the camera work is relatively basic throughout, giving the actors plenty of room to work with natural rhythm. Segel definitely impressed me, as this was the first dramatic role I've seen him in. While he didn't exactly capture some of Wallace's real-life mannerisms, I'm not sure if that was exactly the point of the film. He interpreted the script in a powerful way, and I think that that ended up working out quite well for the overall tone of the film. Eisenberg played his usual somewhat neurotic, slightly asshole- ish character very well, and I thought it fit the reporter role perfectly.

Overall, I would strongly recommend the film. 9/10

Rarely am I enlightened by a film in the way I was by this one. Not that I was lectured or taught something, but that I had a visceral response to what I had experienced on screen that I wouldn't be able to explain but to ask you to recall a song or a book or a show that invited you to pour your soul into it and in return reminded you of what it was like to have one. I was reminded that films can do this.

I don't expect everyone to like it to the degree that I did because I can only base my strong inclination towards this movie on the connection I personally made with it which was emotional rather than intellectual, although the film is rich and lingering in its intellect as well, and of course; I recognize what makes this film profound, which I'll try to explain.

This is a talky film from director James Ponsoldt, who I'd now have to rank as one of my favorite contemporary directors after this and another I've seen and loved, The Spectacular Now. This director isn't one you'd normally find on a list ranking among the greatest working today because he's not about style and doesn't appeal to the ego as much as other contemporaries such as Wes Anderson and David Fincher do (in addition to many others, not to single them out). No, Ponsoldt is subtle and reserves his ego. He is unimposing on the lives of his characters and candid about what his films are trying to do and say, not hiding beneath film rhetoric or allegory or the impression of a representational work. And what's great about this is how his films point out that you don't need intricate sets or perfectly symmetrical shots to create beauty. This film has some of the most beautiful shots I've seen (the shot of them walking in the snow, the shot of the normally- withdrawn Wallace dancing), all the more so because of their subtlety, giving the feeling that the beauty was discovered and not created by the director.

But the beauty is often created by the actors. Ponsoldt trusts his actors and puts his efforts towards making the characters come alive before our eyes. I was under the fantastic impression that I was witnessing a completely real human soul with Segel's performance. He felt so real, so three dimensional. I understand him, even though I am not him. This is more magical to me than sweeping camera movements or extravagant art direction. 

I didn't realize when watching the film that the dialogue is all based on, if not directly taken from, the tapes journalist (and protagonist) David Lipsky (Eisenberg) recorded of his interviewee, universally acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace (Segel). The dialogue is rich with insight into the character's thought processes and their observations on life (but mostly those of Wallace). I was riveted at every moment the two were talking, feeling as though being revealed before me were the truths of life. The thrill of being a fly on the wall. And it's not just the words containing the wisdom of the thoughtful and complicated Wallace, but the delivery via the actors and the way in which the many hours of tape are edited to allow Wallace's ideas and observations to resonate. Even beyond Wallace's ideas, the film cuts to the core and observes Wallace as a human being, not different for his brilliance but the same for his humanness.

The film is about so many things it would be overwhelming to attempt list all of them. Its ideas, however many, are all-encompassing of what it means to exist, which is, beyond the desire for fame and ego-boosts, to want to be understood. The film observes how the inner-worlds of all people are so uniquely complicated and pays tribute to that wonder. I'll be relating my experiences to this film in time to come.

In 1996 David Foster Wallace's 1079-page novel Infinite Jest hit the literary scene like a rocket. The publisher's marketing efforts meant the book was everywhere, but the man himselfshy, full of self-doubt, not wanting to be trapped into any literary poseur moments and seeing them as inevitablewas difficult to read. This movie uses a tyro journalist's eye to probe Wallace during an intense five days of interviewing toward the end of the Infinite Jest book tour. As a tryout writer for Rolling Stone, reporter David Lipsky had begged for the assignment to write a profile of Wallace, which ultimately the magazine never published. But the tapes survived, and after Wallace's suicide in 2008 they became the basis for Lipsky's 2010 book, Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself, which fed David Margulies screenplay. The plot of the movie is minimal; instead, it's a deep exploration of character. It may just be two guys talking, but I found it tectonic. Director James Ponsoldt has brought nuanced, intelligent performances from his two main actorsJason Segel as Wallace and Jesse Eisenberg as reporter David Lipsky. Lipsky is a novelist himself, with a so-so book to his credit. Wallace has reached the heights, and what would it take for Lipsky to scramble up there too? Jealousy and admiration are at war within him and, confronted with Wallace's occasional oddness, one manifestation of which is the attempt to be Super-Regular Guyowning dogs, eating junk food, obsessively watching televisionhe isn't sure what to feel. You see it on his face. Is Lipsky friend or foe? He's not above snooping around Wallace's house or chatting up his friends to nail his story. Lipsky rightly makes Wallace nervous, the tape recorder makes him nervous; he amuses, he evades, he delivers a punch of a line, he feints. When the going gets too rough, Lipsky falls back on saying, "You agreed to the interview," and Wallace climbs back in the saddle, as if saying to himself, just finish this awful ride, then back to the peace and solitude necessary actually to write. In the meantime, he is, as A. O. Scott said in his New York Times review, "playing the role of a writer in someone else's fantasy." The movie's opening scene delivers the fact of the suicide, which by design looms over all that follows, in the long flashback to a dozen years earlier and the failed interview. You can't help but interpret every statement of Wallace's through that lens. The depression is clear. He's been treated for it and for alcoholism, from which he seems to have recovered. The two Davids walk on the snow-covered farm fields of Wallace's Illinois home and talk about how beautiful it is, but it is bleak, and even in as jam-packed an environment as the Mall of America Wallace's conversation focuses on the emptiness at the heart of life. Yet his gentle humor infuses almost every exchange, and Lipsky can be wickedly funny too. Wallace can't help but feel great ambivalence toward Lipsky; he recognizes Lipsky's envy and his hero-worship, and both are troubling. He felt a truth inside himself, but he finds it almost impossible to capture and isn't sure he has, saying, "The more people think you're really great, the bigger your fear of being a fraud is." Infinite Jest was a widely praised literary success, but not to Wallace himself.

To me, this was the best film at Sundance Film Festival with a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and life lessons. Both Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel had towering performances in this film. And James Ponsoldt (Director of Spectacular Now and Smashed) presented the two main characters' relationship perfectly. The cinematography was also simply amazing! You can tell that the cinematography for this film was done so passionately as well as the music in this film. Of course who could expect anything less from 4-time Oscar nominee Danny Elfman for his amazing composing skills. To me this is a must see for audiences who are young adults (although it can be viewed by any age) mainly because of its view on how life should be lived. Right after the film was over there was a Q&A and one of the members of the audience stated, "Mr. Segel if you don't receive an academy award or nomination for your performance I would be very surprised." I just hope this film doesn't become another gem that goes unnoticed because of all the huge studio releases this year.

"The End of the Tour" is a hard-sell of a movie. While it features Jesse Eisenberg (whose career have been very hot) and Jason Segal and you'd think the film would have mass appeal, it clearly does not. This isn't a complaint--many of the films I really enjoy are really not the sorts of films that would entertain the most viewers. Instead, it's a film for a narrow audience and if you think you might be among those who would appreciate the movie, by all means watch it. After all, you will see some very nice acting and the story improves and gains momentum as the film progresses.

The story is about an odd sort of interview that took place when David Lipsky (Eisenberg) of Rolling Stone Magazine hung out with literary star David Foster Wallace (Segal) for several days back in the late 1990s. Cutting right to the chase, the film begins with the announcement that Wallace committed suicide and the film is a flashback as Lipsky remembers the strange and very lengthy meeting the two had back in 1996. As I said, this lasted days as the two just hung out together and talked...making it far different than a typical magazine interview.

As far as what they talk about and the themes of their meeting go, this really isn't something I can really explain very well in a review-- you just need to see it and experience it. Instead, I would rather try to convey the style of their time together on the film. It feels like you are a fly on the wall as two intellectuals talk and talk and talk....and talk. Wallace generally presents more as an 'Every Man' sort of guy while Lipsky seems, at times, as if he's trying to impress his new friend with his intellectual prowess. What all this means...well, that's really up to the viewer.

The bottom line is that if you really like action films, this film's is probably not for you. If you love 'literature' as opposed to just reading a book for enjoyment, this movie might be exactly what you'd love to see. As for me, I think I'm in the middle on this one. I can really respect the acting as well as the filmmakers' desire to make a quality picture as opposed to a mass-marketed film. But, on the other hand, the film is slow and very deliberate. It also took a while until I really stared to appreciated it...and I'm not if I ever exactly enjoyed it.

"Fiction's about what it is to be a human being." David Foster Wallace

In 1996 David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) interviewed acclaimed author David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) over the course of several days in Minneapolis for a book tour about his 1000 page epic novel, Infinite Jest. Essentially a two hander in the spirit of the recent True Story, about the interview with alleged murderer Christian Longo (James Franco), The End of the Tour is one of the most accessible biopics about smart people in recent memory.

What sets The End off from True Story and other stories about gifted, troubled authors is its easy manner that doesn't play up intellectual snobbery but rather tries to understand the isolation and diffidence of geniuses. While Lipsky is not the genius writer that Wallace is, he is still a published novelist and a writer for Rolling Stonethe boy has the chops that allow him to get inside Wallace, as much as that is possible with writers slightly less private than, say, JD Salinger.

Wallace reveals himself, albeit obliquely, as a talented working class author bedeviled by addictions that seem to feed his insecurities: Obsessed by TV, he decides not to have one because he'd watch it; having overdosed on booze, he decides not to drink; whether or not he became addicted to heroin is uncertain.

What is certain is that as individualistic as Wallace is, and his densely verbose prose would confirm that, he is still one of us just trying to figure out his existential place in a chaotic world. His immersion in pop culture makes the brainy prose readable and enjoyable because he is tuned in and while heavily analytical, in touch with our daily experience.

Such is the spirit of The End of the Tour: it frequently relies on the mundane (e.g., pop tarts for breakfast, McDonald's for dinner, old TV shows for entertainment) to allow the more challengingwhy he wears a bandannato reveal his soul (he worries that Lipsky's question about the affectation of the bandanna now makes himself conscious about wearing it, as if he were trying for an impression when he actually wasn't). His prose can be downright entertaining: "Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshiping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship."

Segel is a revelation as an actor. From mediocre romcoms to perfectly embodying a conflicted writer, Segel remains in low-key character throughout. Here's what Wallace says about the loneliness that was his constant companion before he committed suicide:

"Fiction is one of the few experiences where loneliness can be both confronted and relieved. Drugs, movies where stuff blows up, loud parties  all these chase away loneliness by making me forget my name's Dave and I live in a one-by-one box of bone no other party can penetrate or know. Fiction, poetry, music, really deep serious sex, and, in various ways, religion  these are the places (for me) where loneliness is countenanced, stared down, transfigured, treated." (The Pale King, 2011)

We're currently attending a film festival and this is one of the featured films. My first indication that this might be more than I expected was the line of young people, including many young women, who were interested in getting what amounts to stand by tickets for the showing that featured an after movie panel discussion with Jason Segel and the director, James Ponsoldt. Now, I only know of Segel's work and haven't seen much of it. He isn't a particular attraction for me, but after seeing this movie, I'm quite sold on his ability especially when nurtured by the sensibilities of Mr Ponsoldt. The director read Mr Wallace's greatest work 'Infinite Jest' back when it first came out to huge success and makes sure you get a glimpse of the man's ability and charm.

Probably the only unfortunate part of all this is that this movie is not going to have wide appeal. It is almost exclusively about the real life meeting between a Rolling Stone journalist and newly minted super-author David Foster Wallace, back in the 90s. As such it is almost all dialog meant to convey a sense of Mr Wallace's breadth of knowledge about popular culture and his imagination. 

There's little drama or action here in the usual sense. Still Mr Segel is most effective in breathing life into the man such that you would love to have known him. Even his co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, who I don't usually warm up to, is quite up to the task at hand, i.e., sparring with the great author to get the real man down on paper.

I loved the film, but I must make special mention that, for a film filled with dialog, for once, I caught every word. There was no asking my wife, what did he say? Why can't every film be as carefully constructed?

The End of The Tour was a beautifully done movie that will not be widely seen or even heard of. This movie doesn't have explosions, or side splitting humor, or sex, or anything that sells in Hollywood these days. What this movie does have is a well written plot with fantastic dialogue, a great story, wonderful performances, and thought provoking themes that make you ponder what is really important. The End of The Tour is about the five day interview between Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky, and acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace (played by Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel). This five day interview took place right after the 1996 publication of Wallace's epic 1,000 page novel called Infinite Jest. An interview that would later turn out to be never published and not really heard about until Wallace's 2008 suicide. During this interview, we get to see inside what it is like between the two men. Like I said earlier, this movie asks a lot of deeper questions that will leave you thinking. Questions like what is really important? If I am unhappy right now, will having what someone has change that? That even being famous and looked upon by the public doesn't really make you truly happy. We have seen this time and time again with famous celebrities that everyone thinks has it all together, give it all away because of depression and loneliness. This movie does an excellent job of portraying that. My only critique about this movie is that you never really get to know the character David who was doing the interview. They allude to deeper issues within him but never dive into them and expose them. Average Man Score: 8/10

David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) has died in an apparent suicide. David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) retrieves tapes of his interview with the writer. Twelve years earlier in 1996, Lipsky has written a book of limited success. His girlfriend Sarah (Anna Chlumsky) tells him about Wallace and his ground breaking book "Infinite Jest". He convinces his Rolling Stones editor (Ron Livingston) to assign him to join Wallace on his book tour. The juiciest question is Wallace's rumored heroine use. Lipsky becomes friends with Wallace and is unwilling to bring up the subject. In Minnesota, they are joined by Wallace fan Julie (Mamie Gummer) and Wallace's ex Betsy (Mickey Sumner). Wallace accuses Lipsky of flirting with Betsy and they dive into the tougher issues.

The first half of the movie isn't that compelling to me. The two characters are intriguing but there is no drama in their friendly dialog. Lipsky isn't pushing the conversation hard enough but that's also the point of the editor's call. Mostly I'm wondering where this movie is going with this and waiting for a turn. The phone call to Sarah starts the turn and Wallace's accusation completes it. The second half is very intriguing. It's an interesting study of these characters.

The End of the Tour is not a film about David Foster Wallace, so much as it is a carefully crafted love note to him and his complication. And to that end, it openly professes its loyalty to the disenfranchised, over-educated members of the audience. At a Cruz in the film we hear Wallace offer his opinions on depression and addiction, but these are no doubt Lipskys own feelings, and given to Wallace in screen to give them more credibility. Wallace is portrayed as a man looming large with first-world-problems, and Jason Segel's Wallace remains affably antisocial throughout the affair. Still, whatever is compelling about the film exists within the writing, but not necessarily the actual story.

The film is not, in fact, based so much Wallace but on Rolling Stones interviewer David Lipskys memoirs recounting of his five days with Wallace. Our plot is set up simply, with Lipskys credentials established as a newly published author, skeptical and jealous of Wallaces universal acclaim and the sole voice of inquiring literary minds at Rolling Stone magazine. After demanding of his editors to grant him the freedom of an interview (in a scene that included, I s*** you not, the Perry White via Lois lane line delivery of "There better be a Story!"), Lipsky then embarks on cinemas least funny buddy comedy, complete with planes, trains and automobiles.

The screenwriter, Donald Margulies, is an accomplished playwright, a profession suited best to find drama in what is essentially a lot of talking. To this end, he does an adequate job of making us interested, but the character development feels too compressed at times. There are moments even, when the story starts to feel like it wished it was the intellectualized parallel to Cameron Crowes Almost Famous, but never has the decency to be a clearly fictionalized. Wallace is written as the more complex character, but it's clear this is Lipsky's story and he's riding Wallaces back. Eisenberg is unintentional in lacking the dimension to convey this, while Segel's portrayal continually rings true. 

As Wallace loosens to Lipsky throughout the movie, he reaches our climax in three notes. First, while our duo is in a moment of confrontation, Wallace spouts the values of remaining grounded against his ever growing fame. The second is his diatribes on addictions and the romance associated with them, and lastly, a confessional late night summery of his neurosis. It's a brilliant inclusion by the screenwriter and director to allow room for melodic musing, broadening the appeal of any given insights.

The Director, James Ponsoldt, does a fine job of framing the travels of the two, creating an intimacy that most likely never existed. The reality is that Ponsoldt doesn't have much to work with that isn't dramatized by Margulies, as those five days produced nothing of interest for Rolling Stone (The intended article was never published) nor did Lipsky feel compelled to expand upon it until Wallaces death 12 years later. I'm sure there's there's some clićhe to spout about why Lipsky sat so long on this story, but it feels ever the notion of timing, and good fortune on Lipskys part.

I couldn't sit through all of this movie. Just had to leave. We lasted somewhere into the middle of this boring dialogue posing as a movie. Maybe it gets better in the last half. The idea is not that bad. It's just that when the actual interview starts, it's so dull and goes on and on and on. With questions and a script that might have worked in a high school play. The acting is good. I just don't understand how this is a movie. It was a novel. Maybe the adaptation was the problem. It never seems to get off the ground. Just talk, talk, talk, talk in a sort of monotony. All very affable and unengaging. No dramatic tension. I don't understand all of these reviews on here that rave about this. What's the big deal? I think I missed the point. But I wasn't going to sit through another 45 minutes of that.

This is an unexpected biographical drama. I don't know who are those two guys, I mean not the actors, but the real life characters. I never read their books or heard their names, though the film sounded great, so I decided to watch it. The entire film was an interview between a newly famed writer and a journalist who dreaming to become like him one day. So basically the young journalist desperately makes himself an opportunity to meet the writer and they take a road trip, discussing various topics.

It's hard to say who was best, both Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel were excellent. I think it was the best casting, they will be the reason if you want to watch it, not the story. Yep, the story was simple, just talking life, present and future of humankind, other celebrities and finally differences between them. That's the part I loved. I mean famed people or genius, whoever they're, they are just like us when it comes to interacting with others. They argue too, it's not like the worst thing to happen, but a normal thing as a human being. Just like animals locking their horns over land or females and sometimes for a no reason.

It was directed by 'The Spectacular Now' filmmaker, based on the bestselling memoir by David Lipsky, the character that played by Jesse Eisenberg. It takes place in the late 90s, but present in the film as a recall after a certain event. If you like 'Before Sunrise' kind of films, you will enjoy it, but if you hate slow pace narration, then you should better skip than giving a bad review and rating badly to wreck it up.

This is one of those films that fits into the very welcome genre of realistic films. It is picked from life, with no added drama. Plus, this film is unusual since it focuses more on dialogue and thought than on action.

We have two absorbing characters here, both of whom are strongly intellectual. Little does our protagonist know that the man he is going to meet for an inspiring interview will leave such deep impressions on his mind, that will be a part of him forever. The characters are sketched with depth. Their ideologies is what the film is all about, and they make for interesting viewing. I was apprehensive of my own interest in the film after the first few scenes. But after going through half an hour I could not get the film to pause.

Feelings of loneliness among the famous are not a new subject. But this film is much more than just that. It is about success, failings, isolation, rejection and insecurities. It portrays these most powerful human emotions in the simplest of ways. In the end, it does not seem to be about that celebrity, but about each one of us.

This film is so fine that words will fall short to describe it's intricacies. A film to be experienced.

I haven't read any David Foster Wallace so the premise of this movie never really appealed to me. Yet when I found out it was directed by James Ponsoldt it immediately jumped to the front of my queue. His previous movie, The Spectacular Now, is one of the greatest coming of age movies I've ever seen. 

The End of the Tour features a lot of great dialogue, many of the conversations covering topics that reveal a lot, but hide even more. I feel like the movie is about the simple conflict of who you present to the world against who you feel you truly are. Jason Segel was amazing in this, disappearing into his role and making you forget all about his previous roles in Apatow comedies. 

I highly recommend this movie for anyone wishing to be challenged or who wishes to take in a great conversation starter.

**** May contain strong spoilers ****

This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....

This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.

The ordinary day to day dialogue, pace and simplicity of a extraordinary writer wanting to be just as "all other people".... that is the springboard that come to place when this motion picture starts off. Is it interesting? Is it good? Is it boring? Is it adorable?

To be honest this is the first movie in a looooooong time I turned off after about 40 minutes, thinking: "Wow....this is the first movie in a looooong time O turned off just wanting to leave it for another more giving film...."

Both Jason Segel and Jessie Eisenberg is making achievements that is highly competent. The mystery, situation and the atmosphere of the ambiance between the journalist that just want to get the answers to his questions, to the author that contemplates about his contemplating is displayed in a professional and graspable way.

If you want to experience an conversation of about 1 hour and 40 minutes; turn this on. If you want anther type of experience; consider this one more than three time before turning it on.

Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Shows the sides of America in a everyday life. - The actors : Makes sense and gives what the manuscript demands. - The story : Can be highly interesting... or just boring. I am in both of the perspectives. - Entertainment : Sloooooow paced. Sometimes shining and intelligent dialogue. - Age : Adults, as young ones probably will run away after 15 minutes.

5,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my entertainment of the movie.)

(Short elucidation for the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5Approved.)

What can I add than to warn: if you think the art form of film should primarily be about the visual - acting can be appreciated in the theatre - where this rightly belongs - then, this effort simply fails: it's tedious to watch: nothing of import or dramatic really ever happens: merely two talking heads (á la 'My Dinner with Andre' style) - yet intriguing (occasionally) to listen to, if only for Segel delivering the lines that supposedly the real DFW author shared with Rolling Stone's Lipsky. 

But that's the problem: it reminded me of the sort of compilation of leftovers and demos etc that rock bands put together to scrape the barrel after their demise from glory: occasional gems (one on, ah, 'self pleasuring' in particular! - see the quotes sidebar :-), but otherwise, mostly underwhelming dross. Then, true if Segel is the stand out in delivering those lines, but as his interlocutor interviewer, JE once again delivers unfortunately one of his characteristic tic ridden, nervy, too fast paced throwaway whiny lines, which with the regular effete laughter he interjects into almost every response to Segel's DFW life observations, just left me irritated, unable to concentrate on any of those supposed pearls of wisdom JS/DFW confided.

But perhaps the major complaint / letdown by director and scriptwriter was that, as DFW tragically committed suicide, and these transcripts were published posthumously, we get no insight or revelation or indeed any sort of real reference for why such a waste of talent occurred - other than hinted at (mere?) loneliness  which seemed either lazy or contemptuous of Ponsoldt and Marguilies, respectively! 

In short, of far less importance than it (they? Ponsoldt, Margulies - Lipsky?!!) would have you think it is.

When i heard the title "The End of the Tour" for the first time, I thought of the Tour de France and cycling movie from this year. That one, however, is called "The Program" and "The End of the Tour" has nothing to do with professional sports. But it is also based on real events. We find out about a journalist from the "Rolling Stone" who goes on a journey with the writer David Foster Wallace. The director is James Ponsoldt and he made "Smashed", one of my favorite films from recent years. The writer is Donald Margulies (based on Lipsky's work) and I cannot say I am familiar with him.

Same goes for David Foster Wallace. I am fairly certain that people who read the book that this movie is about or Lipsky's articles will probably enjoy this film more than I did because they have background knowledge on the whole scenario. So my approach is basically the same as if this film was entirely fictitious. But it did not keep me from enjoying these roughly 105 minutes. It's basically a 2-man show from Eisenberg and Segel with the latter being easily the most memorable aspect of the film. I am not really familiar with Segel in contrast to Eisenberg, but he wowed me here and this made me curious about other films he appeared in. This is not to say that Eisenberg was bad by any means. he also delivers a good portrayal. And you have to hold in his favor that he did not have big makeup on him. This is a very slow movie, so it is certainly not for everybody. The first half is basically about the two bonding and truly making a connection, but quickly afterward first tensions arise. As a whole, I enjoyed the watch and recommend it, even if it is not a film that I will soon feel the need to rewatch I'm sure.

The End of the Tour is directed by James Ponsoldt and based on the memoirs of David Lipsky during his week long interview with famous author David Foster Wallace. Ponsoldt directed one of my favorite films of all time, The Spectacular Now, and is also directing an upcoming Tom Hanks film, so I was looking forward to seeing him take on The End of the Tour. I'll say right off the bat, this isn't a film for everyone. It's for all intents and purposes a 'talkie' that really asks its viewers to pay attention for the entire length of the film or else you'll miss it. 

With that said, I liked the movie, but I didn't love it the way I thought I would. Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel star alongside each other as the two Davids, and have great on screen chemistry. But it's always hard watching an Eisenberg film. For the most part, he never really escapes his own personality, which is the reason why he was a brilliant choice for Mark Zuckerberg, but I digress. He does fairly well with the emotional weight his character carries at the book- ends of the film, but his performance and character for that matter is pretty dull. The worst part is that he has an incredibly annoying laugh throughout the film, which I hope wasn't intentional.

Jason Segel on the other hand really impressed me. At the surface, his character is also pretty dull, but when the film goes on it begins to make sense as to why he's playing Wallace like that. It's then you realize just how brilliantly guarded and reserved he is as David Foster Wallace. Being subtle as an actor is often one of the most difficult things an actor can do. But the film then tries to spray conflicts on the two lead characters that don't feel natural. The small romance part of this film falls completely flat on its face.

Unfortunately, I found the story built around these two guys to be uninteresting and surprisingly dry. It also is almost mimicking a Richard Linklater film, and fell short in a lot of ways in doing so. I really like Ponsoldt, but I just don't know that he was the man for the job. His ability to pull off the human drama that floods the latter half of the movie is impressive, but it doesn't really save what came before it.

+Segel's understated performance

+Does have some things to say about life

-Feels too much like a Linklater film

-Dull characters, dry story

I have rarely been so bored watching a movie. "Nuanced"? "Deep exploration of character"? Is this the same film I just saw?? I had heard the name David Foster Wallace, but had never read anything by him, so I came into this movie blind. I was disappointed to learn very little about him. I would have liked to hear some of his writing, hear more about his projects, to know why he was so acclaimed.

Was the movie about Wallace himself, or the interviewer? Was it supposed to draw a parallel between them? There was little content that made me care about either of them. I felt that I was supposed to be getting the impression that there was a genuine connection forming between the two men, but I never felt anything of the sort. I think I was also supposed to believe that the interviewer was in awe of or envious of the writer, but Eisenberg's acting never convinced me of this. The interviewer is supposed to be a published novelist himself, but we're given no clues about what interests him, what bothers him, what he wonders about or cares about. Instead, he came across as a novice interviewer asking boring scripted questions, trying to please his boss by digging awkwardly for prize material. Occasionally it seemed he'd have a fleeting second thought about his methods, or about some of his questions, but these weak moral quandaries never led anywhere. And his clumsiness and contrived bluntness never provoked an interesting reaction from Wallace, except in one brief scene. The script was dull; Wallace said a few wise things, but the interviewer never really picked up the threads in any believable way.

It seemed like the whole first hour was just a lot of posturing by the interviewer. I hoped that this was all just to set up a plot twist, followed by a completely different second half. Indeed, there was a moment somewhere around the one-hour mark, where Wallace says to the interviewer that their conversation is "nice" but "not real" and I thought - yes, NOW we get real, get into the meat of it, where they both really open up - but it never happened. Maybe Segal's acting was good because he offered a good rendering of Wallace, but I found the character monotonous. Yeah, he said some bright stuff, but his emotional tone barely changed. Maybe that was true to life, but boring. Same but worse with the interviewer. Dull, dull, dull. What a shame, because I like these two actors a lot.

THE END OF THE TOUR (2015) **** Jason Segel, Jesse Eisenberg, Anna Chlumsky, Mamie Gummer, Mickey Sumner, Joan Cusack, Ron Livingston. Absorbing quasi-biopic about the late author David Foster Wallace (Segel in an Oscar-worthy turn of brilliance and balancing comedy/tragedy perfectly) on the last leg of his book tour for his iconoclastic book "Infinite Jest" accompanied by "Rolling Stone" journalist David Lipsky (equally good Eisenberg) who sees a story in his subject as well as bonding with him in friendship with some doubts along the journey the two men embark upon. Literate and smartly conceived by Donald Margulies' adaptation of Lipsky's account "Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself" with moments of deadpan comedy and piercing poignancy no doubt even-keeled direction by James Ponsaldt leave in indelible imprint on the cost of fame in the pursuit of honesty, truth and integrity (the ultimate price of celebrity defeating one's own self-worth). One of the year's best; a must see for those who love well-written and spoken dialogue.

At the start of The End of the Tour, David Lipsy's editor tells him there had better be a story. Unfortunately for us viewers, there is not. What we get is an aimless two hour snooze that plays like a less interesting version of Almost Famous and that not even a chameleonic and career best performance from Jason Segel can salvage.

The biggest (and actually, only) positive of the film is Jason Segel as David Foster Wallace. He's completely mesmerising when he first appears, this big, shy, self-conscious guy who feels far more uncomfortable in the spotlight than anyone suspects. Funnyman Segel vanishes into Wallace with a hundred tiny mannerisms and facial expressions to show the emotions that the real Wallace wore plainly across his face. We see a shade of disappointment cross his face when Lipsky pulls out his recording device, just as we see the moment he finally clicks with this Rolling Stone New Yorker as they discover a common trait. Even when putting his foot down to prevent Lipsky interviewing his parents, he seems uncomfortable with the authority he wields and you can almost hear the inner dialogue saying "can I get away with this?" When he does get angry over Lipsky flirting with his ex-girlfriend, its not theatrical but rather simple and with great authenticity - and Segel invokes in the audience the same reaction you'd get if it were from a friend whose approval meant the world to you. Segel's performance is one of great subtlety reminiscent of Mark Ruffalo's brilliant performance in Foxcatcher last year, and in a just world, Segel would be in the conversation for an Oscar nomination.

The rest of the film, however, is absolutely nothing to write home about. Jesse Eisenberg is great in some scenes, but in others he just comes across as a typical nasally Eisenberg character. He plays well with Segel when the two of them circle each other, jealous of the other's life, but they lack the connection shared by Fugit and Crudup in the infinitely better Almost Famous. Mickey Sumner's Becky and Mamie Gummer's Julie spark some interest, but perhaps that's just because the film was stale without them. The marvellous Joan Cusack is completely wasted in a nothing role.

The screenplay is filled with authentic dialogue, which is respectful but far from entertaining. This is a conversation movie where little actually happens, but when compared with something like Bridge of Spies or 12 Angry Men, its incredibly dry. Segel has one eloquent monologue towards the end of the film, but the fact that another one follows about 2 minutes later ruins its impact. The very limited story that actually does happen outside the dialogue is cliché ridden - such as the boss back home who says "get the story, don't be his friend". 

James Ponsoldt's direction is serviceable - there's nothing remarkable about it. This is most noticeable when Lipsky drops Wallace's suicide watch into conversation. A more talented director would have crafted the scene to create a spike in tension, something broken between the two as Wallace's defensive barriers shoot up. Segel tries, but Eisenberg doesn't even blink about what he's just said and the scene quickly passes. The sound mixing team deserves a whack over the back of the head for allowing that hideous rubber-squelching sound of Lipsky's boots to so dominantly feature in the final scene, at one point drowning out Eisenberg's words. Danny Elfman's score is interesting - despite sounding like something out of a 1990-era Gameboy game looped endlessly, it has a peculiar beauty and felt somehow appropriate. 

Ponsoldt's biggest failure however is that the film is utterly boring. Once we've we've become accustomed to Segel's brilliance as Wallace, the film becomes excruciating. Looking at the Wikipedia summary of the plot, the last fifty minutes is accurately summarised into about two or three sentences, and yet it somehow takes up fifty minutes. I had to multitask while I watched it, and my attention weaved in and out without missing anything.

Watched it because of the favorable reviews but it did not do anything for me. There isn't anything that sticks out. The acting is OK for both of the leads, the script was just bland, the interaction between them above average, the cinematography is nil, and so on.

It tries to be a "smart" type of movie but it really isn't. Big words are thrown every now and then between the two leads but this is more to lead the audience to believe there's some intelligence going on. As Jessie stated on the way back from the tour, it is some patronizing thing that the characters tries to put on the audience. It doesn't feel natural at all but then neither does it feel overly forced.

The music used in the movie is pretty simple, nothing extraordinary.

In the end there are better drama movies than this. Buddy films such as Pineapple express and even Zombieland have more emotion, attachment and realism than this movie.

Heard of David Foster Wallace? No? How about David Lipsky? Me neither. That's probably because I watch so many movies. These two men are writers and "The End of the Tour" (R, 1:46) is about the latter interviewing the former. Like many Americans, for better or worse, the best way to get me to pay attention to writers is to put their work or their personal stories into a movie. Now the question is: Was it a movie worth making? Or, more to the point: Is it a movie that's worth your time and money? In 1996, Wallace (Jason Segel) was a college professor and author who had just published his magnum opus, "Infinite Jest". This book (officially categorized as an "encyclopedic novel") uses its story of a dystopian future to comment on, according to Wikipedia, "addiction and recovery, family relationships, entertainment and advertising, film theory, United States-Canada relations (as well as Quebec separatism), and tennis." The tome received glowing reviews from most critics, catching the attention of Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg), who was himself an author and a writer for "Rolling Stone" magazine. Encouraged by his girlfriend (Anna Chlumsky), Lipsky read the book, decided for himself the hype was justified, and convinced his editor (Ron Livingston) that a Wallace interview would make a good story.

Lipsky made the trip to Bloomington, Illinois, in order to meet Wallace and join him on the last leg of his book tour. The two men get to know each other as they drive around town, hang out at Wallace's modest rural home and then travel to Minneapolis and back. In Minneapolis, a publicist (Joan Cusack) picks up the two Davids at the airport, shows them around town and makes sure they get to Wallace's scheduled events. In the midst of the ongoing conversation between the two men, Lipsky observes Wallace at a book signing and during an NPR interview, along with getting to meet and hang out with Wallace's college girlfriend (Mickey Sumner) and a fan (Mamie Gummer) with whom Wallace had become friends. As their five days together progresses, Wallace and Lipsky get to know one another better and they're not sure they like what they see in the other. The tensions between them calls into question how their relationship, the interview and the tour are ultimately going to end.

Wallace and Lipsky are two sides of the same coin. As Lipsky's inner monologue reveals to us, "He wants something better than he has. I want precisely what he has already." At this point in the lives of these two writers, Wallace is the more successful one, but also the more neurotic (part of his battle with depression), constantly expressing concern over how his statements will be perceived by the article's readers. He confesses to being "terrified" that his new-found fame will change him. "I have a real serious fear of being a certain way. I treasure my regular guy-ness", says Wallace, to which Lipsky responds, "You don't crack open a thousand-page book because you heard the author is a regular guy. You do it because he's brilliant." It seems that Wallace is the only one who doesn't realize (or can't accept) how special he is. "The more people think you're really great, the bigger the fear of being a fraud is," he reveals in one of many moments of raw honesty. It's a sentiment I think many successful people feel, but few would publicly admit. It's these kinds of insights that make this movie intriguing.

"The End of the Tour" is part biography and part character study, but not much else. It's basically two guys talking and would work well as a stage play or a book. This movie represents the compilation of Lipsky's cassette tape recordings of his conversations with Wallace, which, along with his hand-written notes and personal recollections and insights make up his lauded 2010 book, "Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself". I feel that Eisenberg is miscast as a reporter and his performance is merely serviceable compared to Segel's who shows a range, intelligence, depth of feeling and a vulnerability that I've not previously seen from him. Segel reveals himself as a strong dramatic actor, as he simultaneously gives us a revealing glimpse into the life and mind of David Foster Wallace.

No, this movie isn't "exciting" in the usual big-screen sense, but that doesn't mean it isn't interesting. Of course, Wallace's fans are the most likely to be entertained by this film. The rest of us may enjoy Segel's performance, the well-written script and some insights into human nature, modern culture, fame and ambition, but I'm not sure this movie was the best platform for all that. Maybe I should just read Wallace's and Lipsky's books. The film about their time together gets a "C+".

I didn't read the book so I can say this movie must be for the fans of David Foster Wallace. That's because this was the most boring movie imaginable. I suppose if you read the book and are a fan, then learning anything about the author must be nirvana. I looked up photos of the real David Foster Wallace and he looks much better than this slob in the movie, played by Jason Segel.

Jesse Eisenberg is the other lead and he once again proves that to be a famous actor, you don't need to learn how to act: Just act yourself each time, and if the public likes you, you're a great actor until they tire of you. I'm getting tired of you Jesse.
