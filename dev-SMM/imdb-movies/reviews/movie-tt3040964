Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by the Indian wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and her pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves but Mowgli faces certain challenges and lags behind his wolf siblings, and Bagheera berates him for using human tricks like tool building, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, all the animals in the jungle gather at the Peace Rock to drink the water that remains as part of the Water Truce, a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory animals. The peaceful gathering is disrupted when the fearsome Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes his presence felt. He detects Mowgli's scent amongst the crowd and threatens his life since man is not welcome in the jungle. He holds the scars on his face as proof of man's cruel and destructive nature and issues a warning that when the Water Truce ends and the Peace Rock disappears, he will come for the boy. Thus, a debate and argument arises amongst the members of the wolf pack as to whether or not they should keep Mowgli. But before a general consensus is reached, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the sake and safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the human civilization. However, en-route, Shere Khan ambushes them, injuring Bagheera while Mowgli manages to escape with the help of a herd of water buffaloes. Mowgli, now alone, stumbles upon a thick canopy where he meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), an enormous Indian python who lures him in with promises of safety and an assurance that she knows who and what Mowgli truly is. Kaa's hypnosis shows Mowgli a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan and of himself as an abandoned infant being found by Bagheera and also warns of the destructive power of man's "red flower". Having successfully wrapped Mowgli in her coils, Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray). In exchange for saving Mowgli's life, Baloo tells Mowgli to fetch him honey which is atop a cliff, to which Mowgli unwillingly agrees. Together, they form a close bond and Mowgli decides to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Back in the jungle, Shere Khan visits the wolf pack looking for the "man- cub." When Akela states that Mowgli has left the pack, Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off the cliff. He demands that the boy be handed over to him. Confident that Mowgli will return again, Shere Khan takes over the pack. When Bagheera returns to fetch Mowgli, he discovers that Mowgli has decided to live with Baloo. Although tension is raised between the three, they all agree to sleep on it until the following morning. At night, Mowgli hears a cry for help and discovers that a baby Indian elephant is trapped in a deep pit. Using his tricks, he fashions a rope to rescue the baby elephant. This forms a bond between Mowgli and the Indian elephants. Following Bagheera's instructions, Baloo unwillingly confronts Mowgli and lies to him that he never considered him a friend, hoping that Mowgli can change his mind about staying with him. But Mowgli is suddenly abducted by a group of monkeys who take him to an ancient ruined temple and present him to King Louie (Christopher Walken), a Bornean orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly "red flower". Baloo and Bagheera arrive just in time to distract the monkeys and manage to hold them off while Mowgli flees into hiding. King Louie chases Mowgli through the temple, causing it to crumble on top of him. Before Mowgli leaves, King Louie informs him of Akela's demise. Furious of the fact that Baloo and Bagheera kept him in the dark about Akela's death, Mowgli decides to return to the jungle and confront Shere Khan to avenge the death of his leader and end his tyranny. But first, Mowgli ventures into the village where the humans live and for the first time, he sees his own kind from afar and gazes at them in amazement. He steals one of the burning torches and heads back to the jungle but accidentally starts a fire. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit. When the news breaks out that a man with the "red flower" is making his way into the jungle, all the animals gather at the Peace Rock. Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, but sees how all the animals of the jungle cower in fear at the sight of the fire he holds. He throws away his torch into the water, allowing Shere Khan to attack him. Bagheera, Baloo and the wolf pack manage to hold him off, thus buying Mowgli enough time to set a trap in the burning jungle. He lures Shere Khan into a dying tree with a fig branch and is able to coax him into stepping on it, causing it to break. Shere Khan falls to his death into the pit of fire below. The Indian elephants later help to extinguish the fire by diverting the river. Raksha then becomes the new Alpha and leads the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to do things his own way, having at last found a true home in the jungle with the animals, including his friends Baloo and Bagheera.

The Jungle Book has been raved about by everyone I know, but now that I've finally seen it I don't quite understand what all the hype is about. It's true that the CG is nothing short of outstanding, especially considering a lot of it is done during the day instead of at night, and I'm impressed with how much they were able to accomplish, but a pretty movie and an exceptional movie are not at all the same thing; similarly, a better than average movie and an exceptional movie are not the same thing, and this movie is better than average.

The writing wasn't great, but it was passable. This is a kid's movie after all, and while I don't in any way think that's an excuse for a movie to have a worse script than any other, it's important to understand that the film still needs to keep the children entertained with silly jokes and easy-to-understand dialogue. 

My main problem with the film was the child actor. I'm not expecting a 12-year-old kid to be able act like an A-Lister, but there was one particular shot were he screamed and I accidentally laughed in the near-silent theater because it seemed to out of place and awkward. He was also given outrageously simple and clich√© lines. It was always "I'm doing this thing because of this other thing" and felt like the majority of his talking was done explaining to other characters that he had to reach is his goal instead of developing his character. There were a few scenes where he was able to act like a normal kid, and those were definitely his best performances, but overall he wasn't able to give it his all because what he was supplied with wouldn't allow him to.

The other characters were played well, and the animators did a good job with the choreography of all the fights. Bill Murray was a great choice for Baloo, and at this point I can't think of any other voice that could have given a bear that much character.The songs, however, felt out of place and forced, and that's all I'm going to say about those.

I do not dislike this movie in any sense, and I recommend that people go and see it. At it's heart it is a very good story, and one that I very much enjoy. I'm sure that the nostalgia of revisiting your childhood will help you enjoy it more than I did, because the only scene I'd ever seen from the 1967 movie was the one with the singing monkeys, so there wasn't a lot in the film to connect to my past.

In a word... "Flat." Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure /superhero / CGI remakes of late.

In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.

In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive, especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.

The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly. But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense. Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or make up new ones.

A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings me to the next point...

This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now, so some would argue they can "handle it", but is that the kind of trend for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all). So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time.

The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers.

A great remake that will definitely enchant kids and adults. The CGI characters are excellent and there is an entertaining atmosphere of humor, adventure and suspense. 

Mogwli is a Lost boy in the Jungle,but has been grown up the animals - Bagera(Panther), Rakhsha(Wolf mother), Baloo (Bear). Soon Mogwli realizes that since he is human he needs to live with humans.Yet,he can not abandon his loyal Animals who have already taken care of him since he was a baby.

"The Jungle Book" 2016 has a different,but an amazing ending than "The Jungle Book" 1967.I can guarantee that you will see a perfect movie with Great Graphics IMAX Effect and The Best 3D I Have Ever Seen.

I really estimate Disney for their support of Lesbian and Gays.Disney is Simply The Best.

I've never been a fan of the original Jungle Book movie, but I did grow up watching it, and I did like it. This remake is (in my opinion) Disney's best remake so far.

The animation and the scenery is basically a new age in CGI. Not only are there CGI characters and creatures now, but locations too. The entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it's not, and that's the great thing about it.

The characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn't care for Mowgli in the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He's brave, not as bratty, and he's pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful as ever except that he's also got the action his book counterpart had had. And I like Baloo's character here, having a bit more of a self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually becoming a nice guy. And that's the main characters. The wolves got more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn't have as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out beast.

I'm also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I really liked Bare Necessities, and I've also started singing this version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was in a spy movie.

So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect score: 10/10. It's an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie.

When I went to see this movie I kept thinking about how great was the cartoon movie with all its extravagant and funny characters: Balu, the elephants, even evil characters like Kaa (the snake) were fun to watch. How could I even forget a minor character like the vultures, and their jokes on Shere Khan? Their humor was great in contrast with the tiger's ego. I thought I would revive all those memories watching this movie. I was wrong.

This movie is lacking of various things. First, a good plot. Second, good characters with relevant appearances. Third, humour (nonexistent if we ignore Balu) and a good atmosphere for songs (is this supposed to be a musical?). And fifth but not least, WHAT IS KING KONG DOING IN KING LOUI'S TEMPLE?? What they have done to that poor monkey is unbearable.

MY SUMMARY(SPOILERS):

King Loui doesn't dance. Shere Kahn doesn't bother to chase Mogli through the jungle. Why would him anyway? He already knows the plot. Kaa's appearance in the movie is what in Spanish we call "postureo". He appears once. He narrates Mowgli's origins to the spectator (how plot convenient...). He tries to eat the kid with no success and fades away to live happily ever after. The rest can be summarized in: f*ck logic. I have been walking for two days to get to the human village, and now I can just run away for 10 minutes with a torch in hand to get just where the movie started. Hi, my name is Mowgly and I like to burn down jungles in my free time (appaluse). AH AND THE VULTURES DON'T EVEN SPEAK IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, SAME AS THE ELEPHANTS which are considered gods among the other animals (wtf) and magically appear in the last scene to save the day.

Please re watch the old movie instead of wasting your money in this thing. Why Loui?... Why?...

after seeing this could not believe the reviews, the film was bad, bad and bad. the kid playing mowgli has to be the worst child actor i have ever seen, terrible voice, one gormless expression throughout the film, he could not convey joy, sadness or fear. the film looked fuzzy and washed out all the way through. all the voices were flat and un emotional, great actors as bill murray and christopher walken sounded like they were on valium. not a patch on the animated version or the korda version and not remotely close to Disney's own previous live action retelling of the story that stephen somers directed with an older mowgli brilliantly played by jason scott lee. the film had no depth, emotion or character to it. the script was clich√© after clich√©. there was no life in any part of it, no pace just seemed to go through tired set ups. as for it having an ecological message, we could not see or find it anyway or anytime during the film.

CGI. A source used to hide props or things in sets, not a good source for characters. My mind is off that statement know changed thanks to the work of Jon Favreau and cast/team. This movie FYI has fantastic CGI, never in this movie I thought that those creatures were CGI. The voice/real acting from all cast was fantastic, even from kid actor, Neel Sethi. And also from the fearsome character, Shere Khan. Voiced by Idris Elba. The story and directing runs smoothly with the visuals and comedic acts animals and human do. This movie is an amazing one from the visual acting and the acting, it deserves a lot of money from the box office, see this movie in theaters or rent it if you can, almost perfect.

Wow! What an amazing visual experience Disney's The Jungle Book is. Jon Favreau and all of the creative team behind this film totally nailed it. This film stands alone as not just a remake but as its own fantastic journey. Mowgli is brilliantly cast as are all of the voices in this Pixar meets Avatar blend of film genius. An absolutely astonishing achievement! Bill Murray's voice shines as well as Christopher Walken and Scarlett Johansson! The plot is the same as the original but the story has been mixed up and re-hashed to allow for a completely unique experience. The Visual effects are beyond astounding! CGI has reached its peak. Adventure and excitement mixed with big laughs and genuine voice acting that brings all the characters completely to life. The music is also rehashed in a way that does not disappoint! In short The Jungle Book is an absolute must see for any individual or family!

If there is one thing that Hollywood is good at is ruining our favorite childhood films, but not with this film. So The jungle book focuses on a boy named Mowgli that is raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle. But when a tiger named Shere khan learns of his presence, he must flee the jungle in search for the man village. Helping him get there is a panther named Bagheera and a bear named Baloo that must protect him until they reach they reach their final destination. First the pros. The special effects are amazing! I've never seen cgi animals look so realistic on screen before. Neel Sethi does a good job at playing Mowgli. Considering that this kid had to work with nothing, then he is does an excellent job. The characters are very likable. Whether they are good guys or villains. The story seems kinda simple, but when it is directed in a way that makes it entertaining, then your going to find yourself liking this film. To be completely honest i didn't see any cons to this movie. Overall i really enjoyed the jungle book. It was fun, visually dazzling, action packed, and funny at times. One things for sure when it is on DVD, I am going to buy it.

What a terrible remake of such a great classic! I was practically falling asleep the first fifteen minutes! And I don't like the way they changed things! The fact that there's now a real boy and "real" animals is unnecessary! I didn't even finish the whole thing and I was disappointed that they ruined such a great original movie! It's upsetting! Cause I watched The Jungle Book from 1967 a lot when I was younger! I wasn't around when the original came out, not until 31 years later. But it's just so upsetting to see such a great movie ruined by unnecessary CGI technology and the plot being switched around! And the fact that the person who voices Kaa isn't even a guy like the original just really aggravates me! So many wrong things about this movie! What a let down! And I don't think I'll finish watching it or watch it again!

"The Jungle Book" was one of my favorite TV series that aired in the Doordarshan in the early '90s. The story has been retold through several movies and this latest blockbuster also does the same. It tells the story of Mowgli, a young boy, grown by a pack of wolves in an Indian Jungle. Disney Pictures this time takes into the CGI over the conventional 2D animation and creates a stunningly superb visual feast. It's certainly something very different you've ever seen. The jungles, animals are all a part of a CGI animation and with the superb techniques you're taken to an hour long drive to the forests in which everything looks for real. Instead of the distant shots, the film uses close shots for which the film looks visually pleasing. No doubt, technically the film is somewhat a testimony of something you've ever encountered in movies.

The acting of the boy as Mowgli and his screen presence looks astounding and the voices given to the animals get quite well. But the grave problem in the film is the lack of the wittiness and charm in its narrative. For one third of the film, there seems a bit of charm and laughter which soon disappears and falls into the computer glitches. Somewhere the innocence, wit, and surprises get lost for which the film though being technically superb starts to lose your attention by the second half.

17 April 2016 Film of Choice Tonight at The Plaza Dorchester - The Jungle Book. Apart from films set in space this has to be one of the most amazing uses of CGI I have seen to date. What a visual assault we were treated to. The jungle in all its glory, never sleeping, never quiet, and always with a surprise around the corner. This latest Disney offering, a live action (mostly CGI) remake of its 1967 story of Rudyard Kipling's jungle book was epic. It took the tale of Mowgli, the man cub and presented it to us in a whole new format. The animals were all very realistic, yet very true to the animated versions we know and love. There were many moments I recognised yet many new ones slotted in effortlessly to the story. A line up of huge talent provided the voices, from Scarlett Johansson as Kaa the snake, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera the panther, Idris Elba as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear was voiced wonderfully by Bill Murray. Although there were a few tense moments which made me jump this is a great film for all the family to enjoy.

I guess this will be a spoiler because I found the story line to be so far from the original, I feel I had to tell you before you wasted your time and money to see it.

I don't know what story this director was trying to copy, but it wasn't The Jungle Book that I know. The only resemblance to the original story are the character names.

There's some stupid part that the elephants created everything, and they had to bow to them to show respect?? What?

And, he never sees the little girl! As far as we know he stays in the jungle??

No where near the original story line. Disappointed that this guy felt he had to re-do the entire story to conform to his stupid theology.

NOTE: the animation and graphics were really cool, but that's not an excuse to change the entire story. It would have been a super movie IF he would have stayed with the story line.

This guy obviously likes himself a little too much to think he has a right to make Jungle Book any way he wants and still call it "Jungle Book".

I doubt I'll ever watch or even remember this movie again because of its lack of emotion/depth/creativity. Really it leaves us with nothing at the end, not even a little bit of warmth. Terrible story line that had me only focus on how beautiful the forest was looking since it failed to deliver neither laughter nor message. Not a single moment of "oh I'm glad I'm watching this movie". It was more like "I just hope the next part will be good" through out the whole movie. 

First the acting from main character was so bad he had a same type of face expression every scene. Even the voices from other animals were completely emotionless I could not relate to any of the character's feelings. 

Second there was nothing new or unseen in this new jungle book. I did not mind the slightly different story line from the original since I was expecting something more innovative from the start. However, It was the same old "man stuck in a jungle" type of story that anyone could come up with, I feel like the popularity it is able to gain right now is fully due to its graphics. 

Most of the movies that do not have a very good plot at least give me a few chuckles on their way. This movie even failed to do that, which is why I felt scammed by the current reviews out here and bothered to actually create an account, make an honest review.

I am so very sorry to say this but I wasted my money seeing this piece of crap! John Favreau may have made decent films including Elf and Iron Man but for me John Favreau has failed to make this film as great as the original animated version.

The film sucks for three reasons. First the film is just a live action remake of the film. Familiar with Kaa wanting to eat Mowgli? Familiar with King Louie wanting to know about Man's Red Flower? Or the book which appears at the start of the cartoon version? Yes all those scenes return to the film. Though the plot is slightly different the film is just to similar to the cartoon version. Why would we want to see all those clips again? It is just how Star Wars fans reacted when they compared Force Awakens to the original Star Wars film A New Hope. So basically the film concerns about Mowgli who has to go to a Man Village after a tiger named Sher Khan will stop at nothing to kill him but you know the story if you seen the cartoon version. To me the film was just to faithful to the 1967 version but it does include tones from the book by Kipling. The film should be more based on the book rather than a remake. Secondly there are to many throwbacks not just to the 1967 version but other previous Disney films. Rakasha telling Mowgli he will always be her son is a throwback to Tarzan, the way Louie sang I want to be like you is similar to how Genie sang You never had a friend like Me from Aladdlin, the fire in the forest is a throwback to both Bambi and the Lion King II Simba's Pride, Sher Kahn falling to his death in the fire is similar to how Frollo died in Hunchback of Notre Dame and the stampede is a throwback to the Lion King. In my opinion this film was like it was made of different reminders of the previous Disney films. Thirdly the voice acting was just terrible especially Baloo and Bagheera. Other actors could have been in the film who would be better suited for the roles. For me John Goodman and Patrick Stewart would had been better choices for Baloo and Bagheera as John Goodman played bumbling characters like Fred Flintstone, the landlord from the Burrowers and Sulley of Monster's Inc. Plus he voiced Baloo in the Jungle Book 2. Patrick Stewart is best known for playing no nonsense characters and he would have nailed it as Bagheera. 

However the scariest character in the film was not Sher Kahn but King Louie. He was the only character I found disturbing due to his size and you know the moment he chases Mowgli hell breaks loose. However I liked the way he sang I want to be like you as it was much better than the cartoon version. That was the only thing I liked in the film. 

Other than that this film is just rubbish. As I said it is a remake of the 1967 version we all know and love. If you were wise just stick to the 1967 version. Save your money!

The movie may have shown a lot of similarities to the old cartoon,but it didn't show enough info or relationship with Mowgli and the wolves. Sure they did the story good with Mowgli and Baloo's relationship,but what it also rushed through was the ending,and plus I didn't like it when Mowgli went to the man village. The fight with the tiger in the cartoon wasn't bad,but the movie just made it 10 times better. The 1967 one was classic,but the movie just made it into the best thrilling and emotional story that even I enjoyed. I mean yes I wouldn't really make reviews for kids movies,but the director was the man who made Iron man and I love marvel. So I checked out this movie,I watched it and I was like "oh my god...this was amazing." So it was just in my opinion,better than the original. The original is in my second place.

Greetings from Lithuania.

"The Jungle Book" (2016) is definitely the most visually stunning movie i've seen in a while, very long while. The story is simple yet good, script is very good, but the true star of this movie was in its craftsmanship. What a feast for the eyes! Can't believe it was shoot at the studio, not in the jungle. Back in 2012 we were stunned by the tiger in "Life of Pi" - the jaw dropping creation of special effects team. In "The Jungle Book" you will see the same level special effects in almost every scene - these animal are as stunningly real as it gets. This is by far the best looking film of 2016. If this one won't win Oscar for best special effects, where won't be justice. 

Jon Favreau's direction is superb - at running time 1 h 40 min. this movie never drags and is a joy for all its running time. Voice performances were absolutely top notch by single everyone of them, especially by Bill Murray who kills it as Baloo. 

Overall, "The Jungle Book" is by far one of the best entertainments of 2016 so far. So many disappointing big summer movies, but leave it to Jon Favreau and special effects wizards to create something marvelous, what "The Jungle Book" truly is.

I'm a sucker for animal stories and The Jungle Book is one of the best. What kid doesn't want run with the wolves and sleep in a tree? 

I won't go into detail about the story as it's already so ingrained in our collective consciousness but I have to pay respects to the production design, art and music - and every element that makes a great picture.

First, the music is so right (SPOILER ALERT!!) When Baloo and Bagheera stand at the edge of the jungle and watch Mowgli save a baby elephant to the tune of The Bare Necessities, the familiar song floats on a sweet and somber note. They know he's becoming a man - and the tender version of the tune compliments what we're seeing on screen; We see the bittersweet realization (and the pride) in the faces of the animals. This is sublime perfection; a perfect marriage of music and the artists' emotional brushstrokes.

That scene alone is worthy of a five-hanky movie status - but the creators of this version of The Jungle Book treat every scene with great affection and respect. Each shot is beautifully framed. Any given frame is a glorious masterpiece in color and composition. In the book world we would give a Caldecott Award to such artistic achievement. I only hope the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences will recognize this beautiful piece of work when it's time to nominate the Oscar films.

Finally, the direction skillfully weaves the beauty and wonder of the jungle world and the humor of growing up - while also sending us on a heart-pounding tale of revenge.

Director/Producer Jon Favreau and his team got it right. 

Bravo.

We've hit a point of no return in terms of remakes: the recent announcement of yet another Indiana Jones film, Disney's intention to produce a new Star Wars film every year, and a mooted reboot of Peter and Elliot the Dragon (!) go a long way to showing the complete inspirational bankruptcy of blockbuster filmmaking. And in case that picture isn't sharp enough for you, along comes Jungle Book to crystallize the issue.

The original is among Disney's most perfect creations, and simply reissuing it in theaters might have accomplished what the present abomination did financially, without any of the wasted effort. What we have here is a deconstruction of the original, where every spin on an old idea misses the mark and every new "idea" turns out to be pointless and predictable.

In true flop-fashion, the problems can be traced to before a camera was even unleashed: the casting becomes and end unto itself, despite a weird mismatch between voice and animal or performance. That blend manages to be less convincing than Homeward Bound (and they used real critters). Ben Kingsley barely pulls off Baghera, but Murray and especially Christopher Walken are embarrassing, especially during the latter's cringe- worthy rendition of "I Wanna Be Like You". The real disappointment is poor young Neel Sethi as Mowgli, who is hung out to dry, too often betraying the digital fakery around him.

The throwback moments are mostly appalling, and the additions, all padding, are yawn- inducing: King Louie has a huge temple? Of course it will crumble during a by-the- numbers chase scene, with none of the humor of the original. The film also awkwardly acknowledges its own pointlessness: since the only way to "improve" on the original is to make everything faster, louder and bigger, serpent Ka is bigger than even Anaconda's titular joke was, and Louie could take King Kong in a fight, while the climactic jungle fire setting the scene for Mowgli's showdown with Khan could probably, in this incarnation, be visible from space.

So there you have it, a tale full of sound and fury, told by idiots etc, as the poet said. White noise. Meanwhile, it hardly registers as a blemish on a more recent poet, original author Rudyard Kipling, who would simply be appalled.

This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever want to watch it again.

The Jungle Book (2016): It has been almost 50 years since the first Jungle Book movie released which itself is an adaptation of 1894 classic novel The Jungle Book.Indians may not get familiar with its title but they have huge affection for their characters Mowgli,Baloo,Bhageera,Akela etc..Now its reboot into live action/CGI has released this April and a huge success world wide.So how is this reboot??

Plot: Living among the wolves in the jungle, young man cub Mowgli (Neel Sethi) quickly learns to live life among his wolf pack under the supervision of Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and all the animals that inhabit the jungle. But when the villainous tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) threatens Mowgli's life, black Panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) offers to take Mowgli to a nearby man village where he will be safe from the tiger's wrath. But along the way, Mowgli gets tangled up in a series of encounters with a sly snake named Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), a swimmingly ruthless gigant opithecus named King Louie (Christopher Walken) and a lazy bear named Baloo (Bill Murray) who quickly becomes his guide to the 'bear necessities' of life. So how did Mowgli deal with his life facing threat from Shere Khan??

Plus Points:

1)CGI: I am damn sure that The Jungle Book is the one which is going to win the Best Visual Effects award at 89th Academy Awards.This one is a technical masterpiece which will have a specific place in history.The scale and the detailing is astonishing to behold especially Shere Khan and Baloo are looking awesome.The technicians gave huge effort in giving such extraordinarily hair-perfect detail, and moves with such persuasive physicality and weight, they might as well be the real..

2)Voice Cast and Neel Sethi: All of the artists have done exceptionally well with their brilliant efforts.The voice-casting of all the animal companions is shrewd to the point of unnerving.Bill Murray is superbly affecting and emotive as Baloo the bear,reminding us why Baloo the Bear is one of the most lovable characters of all time.Idris Elba as Shere Khan is terrifying.Ben Kingsley as Bhageera is excellent.Christopher Walken as Louie is scary and intense.Neel Sethi's acting almost entirely in green-screen,is an incredible effort.He is so adorable.

3)Screenplay and Direction: Though its not the thing we hadn't seen but still its magic remains at its core.The Jungle book always a classic with its heart warming adventure with memorable characters and foot tapping music.This adaptation is nothing less of original one though this one lacks something important (May be I need few extra scenes with Baloo).John Favreau deserves a bow for bringing this classic with at most perfection.

4)Music: The last but not least is the classic songs of The Jungle Book.Bare Necessities doesn't need any introduction.The moment when this song came in the movie,I got tears in my eyes as it brought me back my childhood memories.Bare Necessities,The Simple Bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife......I love this song..

So,The Jungle book is a brilliant adaptation of the classic with award winning technical excellence,perfect voice cast and Bare Necessities....

My rating 7.5/10

The scenery of this movie was very beautiful, as were all the animated characters, but the kid acting as the main actor was terrible and I am shocked at how they could choose someone like that. His monotonous expression and flat voice that conveyed no emotion ruined the movie, as did the meaningless plot. In one and a half hours, this movie was just random and meaningless, with important characters undeveloped. What's the point of remaking an old movie and not adding to it or at least making it fun to watch? The dialogues were extremely lame, especially the bear's. The names of all the animals and places were pronounced ridiculously, some in such a rubbish way, I'm surprised they couldn't consult an actual Indian to at least learn how to pronounce the words. I'm not sure how this movie became so famous, because it's so boring and unexciting. The snake appears for a few seconds and that's all. The monkey also appears briefly. No one is developed, not even Mowgli, and the bear does nothing to seem like he really loves him or anything. He's just selfish. What a rubbishly made thing.

*3/10*
