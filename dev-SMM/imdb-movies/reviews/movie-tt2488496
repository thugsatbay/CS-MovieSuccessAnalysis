### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Sad but true. When the opening credits filled the screen (Episode VII... blah blah) I was already grinding my teeth because the plot sounded idiotic. Then the huge star destroyer filled the screen. The fun bit is that the star destroyer had some sort of antenna or whatever at the front and it looked liked the ship was showing the middle finger towards the viewers. 

I have to congratulate the film makers as that was pretty much how the film worked from that point forward. 

1) A droid has important information that must be delivered to the good guys (Episode IV, anyone?)

2) so the bad guys hunt for the droid on a desert planet (IV) 

3) Storm troopers raid a village, killing everyone (IV) 

4) A girl is captured by the bad guys and the good guys rush to the base to the rescue. (IV) 

5) The girl and the boy have a friend zone relationship through the film (Ep IV, Luke & Leia, wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are siblings in Episode IX) 

6) The stormtroopers, elite soldiers of the bad guys, still can't hit a barn door. On the other hand, the good guys always hit, even when they use a weapon for the first time in their life 

7) Supreme Leader Snoke = Emperor with a silly name 

8) The bad guys have a magnificent new weapon that can destroy planets (Ep IV) 

9) They use it to destroy a planet loyal to the rebels (IV) 

10) The weapon has shields that can be destroyed by going down on the planet and disabling the shield generator (VI) 

11) The epic villain wears a mask that distorts his voice (IV) and sadly, looks better with the mask on than without it.

12) The good guys can only destroy the weapon with an attack by X-Wings on the exact target (IV) 

13) The X-Wings have to fly in a tight trench in order to reach their target (IV)

The screen writers had absolutely no new ideas to show for their money. A bunch of monkeys could have written better dialogue. A 1st grader could have made a plot that had less holes in it. The special effects were pretty much of the same quality as in the first Star Wars movie that was released 1977. I'd expect something way better in 2015.

I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good) demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds)

Anyone with a brain and knowledge of the original trilogy can see that Star Wars: Episode VII was a regurgitation of the first three film's plot condensed into two hours. Everything was the same with slight twists down to the famous "Luke, I am your father" scene except it's with Han Solo and his apparent Sith son who stabs and throws off of the new Death Star.

They added a bigger and badder Death Star, tossed Anakin's lightsaber around to whoever felt like using it to fight and did a terrible job of carrying on Star Wars essence. It was flooded with humor and half a**ed acting. There was no training or build up of power Rey is literally able to defeat the most powerful Sith Lord as a teenage girl who days before didn't even know she was a Jedi. Finn was able to wield and use a lightsaber although as far as I am concerned he is not a Jedi. 

Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to come across the Millennium Falcon after 30 years which just happens to have Luke Skywalker's daughter, Finn, and a droid carrying the map to Luke Skywalker on it. The film was pretty much downhill for me from this point on I spent most of my time watching this with a "What???" face and hands up in confusion as to how they could have made the film suck so bad.

This film literally spanned out the introduction of old characters we know and love in order to keep our attention and keep us excited to see the next only to disappoint us with no further elaboration in story and literally no emotion. Leia hardly even reacted to losing the love of her life Han Solo. The dialogue between the two of them was rushed and obvious that they were trying to explain 30 years of story in small talk. 

What I take as the mentality for this film: MAKE A BIGGER DEATHSTAR, OH BIGGER EMPEROR TOO (srsly what was up with that), GIRL JEDI MAIN CHARACTER, BLACK GUY WHO MIGHT BE A JEDI TOO MAIN CHARACTER (I am African American so don't take this as racism) people are going TO EAT THIS UP. And congratulations, you all did and now they will keep milking the franchise and making terribly thought out films with nothing more than CGI and humor to make up for it. 

Throughout this film I found myself wanting to walk out of the theater and just be done but I couldn't resist waiting for the punchline of this joke of a film and boy did I get it. After all of the humor riddled torture we are brought to the final scene. Rey is going to see her long lost dad who I guess spent all of this time standing on a random mountain looking at the beach. And then it happens, what we had all been waiting for. Luke turns around and sees the daughter he was forced to abandon and she hold out Anakin's lightsaber as some odd tribute to him (I don't see the symbolism in this) at this point I just burst out laughing at how bad this journey has been and that's it it's over. The next thing I see is JJ Abrams. I proceeded to scream "BOO" at the screen multiple times with the only response to it being "cmon it wasn't that bad" after that I walked outside and contemplated throwing up as the movie was so bad it caused me to feel nauseous. 

This film took advantage of Star Wars fans and played into a hand of re-doing famous scenes with different characters and telling the same story over again. It's sad that people actually think this movie was good or acceptable because now they are going to once again shame the Star Wars name.

BOYCOTT EPISODE 8. THIS RENDITION NEEDS TO BE SCRAPPED AND REBOOTED THEY ARE JUST MILKING THIS FRANCHISE.

I jut got just back from the cinema, watching a movie everyone has been waiting for since 1983, me included. And i got to say, I'm starting to get a little bit tired of watching a 2 hour movie about destroying a death star.

Because here we go again! George Lucas did not succeed with his follow-up movies, and there is many reasons for that. And no, it is mainly not because of Jar-Jar, it is because he just threw in one epic battle after the other, without having any good story, or any good plot, and at times horrible acting to come with it.

Michael Bay has this as his trademark, but he is still very successful and his movies makes billions. And why is that?. Because kids. And the Star wars and transformers franchises have in common that they sell toys, in large quantity. This is what really makes the big bucks over time. Not the movies themselves. The movies are just big commercials for toys.

George Lucas knew this better than anyone. And he is a brilliant businessman, but not so brilliant when it comes to making movies.

I do like the first Star wars trilogy, with "the empire strikes back" as my favorite, this is by the way the film in the trilogy George Lucas himself dislikes the most. That pretty much explains why the second trilogy was so bad, as "The Empire Strikes back" spends more time developing a story than the other two films in the original trilogy, and therefor you get more attached to the characters.

When George Lucas then made His second trilogy, all character development went out the window. This was a trilogy that was going to sell more toys, and that's it. Lucas has even half-way admitted this later on. And the fans of the Star wars franchise have disliked the second trilogy almost since release.

I say almost, because many did hang in there for years, denying that the second trilogy was bad. But now most people seem to have noticed.

So here we are in 2015 and J.J. Abrams takes over. He is the new skip, he gave us a fantastic reboot with Star Trek, now he is going to save us all from the god awful mistakes of George Lucas. We all believed it, we all hoped for it, at least he can not do worse than Lucas.

The biggest hype of all time was born.

And we fight a death star.... again....

Just a lot bigger.... Because of course bigger, at least they couldn't make it smaller.....

What about not including a death star... Yet again?

This movie tries so hard to show us a lot of cool stuff. But the pacing is awful, the slapstick humor is mostly misplaced, the introduction of the leading actors suffers from very bad timing. This movie basically tries to look and feel exactly like the original Star Wars film, but fails to bring us close to the leading characters.

In the story, 30 years has gone by. A lot of things happen in that time, but the movie can't tell us anything about what has happened in those 30 years, all we get is guns blazing from the get go, till the very end. Almost no character development what so ever. Not even for Rey, the leading actress. Did J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan think it was enough to show us that when Rey eats less food than usual, was enough to make us really care for her? And just add in the "The family will never come back for you" sub plot? which BTW has no impact.

Yes OK Rey is struggling a bit when we meet her, but she looks very healthy, she is climbing ropes and running like an Olympian in sand..

Ahh no, now i know. They showed us she had good morale by not selling the droid to get a lot more food.. Ahh.. So complicated. *sigh*

This movie is so disappointing. This was their chance to make it right. To make Star Wars good again, not only focus on what 12 year old kids want to see constantly for 2 hours, which is laser beams and explosions. But it makes perfect sense, because these films are now all about making the big bucks, which is from selling toys. And now this film was released just before Christmas... No coincidence.

So it's time to just take in some facts, the movies we grew up with, are never coming back. The only ones in the business that seem to get the movie story and toys business combo right, is Marvel.

They had all this time. All this money. All this willpower. And this is what they come up with. Terrible script, bad story, outdated soundtrack, taking few or no risks to renew the franchise by telling the exact same story as before.

What is really good about this film is the CGI and Sound effects. But that should not come as a surprise to anyone.

The acting is mediocre. No one stands out and brings a really good performance.

4/10 - Very disappointing.

So today I went to the premiere of the long awaited new star wars Episode 7. 

Here is a fast and short opinion: The movie blows really blows. 

Here is the more detailed opinion.

The movie has no star wars feeling. None. No deep dialogs about the force and almost no background about what happened in the period between episode 6 and this one. 

The dialogs between Ray and Finn sound like two modern age teenagers talking (first real dialogue between them, Finn asks Ray if she has a boyfriend). Horrible.

Then there is the First Order (successors of The Empire) the bad guys. Their leader commander is the Sith wimp Kylo Ren who answers to a extremely bad CGI drawn Supreme leader (really?) about whom the audience doesn't get any information at all. 

Kylo Ren is an insecure teenager with anger issues. His character destroys the sleek mysterious Sith presentation of the both prequel as the original trilogy. This is really a bad thing. 

The main weapon of the First order is a death star on steroids. But the way the weapon works is taken straight out of Star Trek. This is a criminal offense. 

Han Solo and Chewbacca appeared in the movie absolutely out of nowhere. It's like Abrams and Disney were desperate to throw them in there just for nostalgia. 

Once again out of nowhere Ray figures out she has Jedi powers. The first time it happens is when Luke Skywalker's (who as been explained shortly decided abandon everyone and live in isolation in a place unknown) light-saber suddenly possesses the ability to show her where it's located in exactly the same way like bracelet of Anubis showed to Evelyn it's location in the movie Mummy returns.

Also the audience figures out later on that non-Jedi's also can fight with light-sabers when Finn ( not a Jedi ) fight the wimpy Sith Kylo Ren. It's like who needs Jedi's, give a light-saber to a regular Joe and he will fight almost as good as a Jedi who had years of training. 

There is one scene near the ending that is so incredibly bad it just makes you want to get up and leave the theater. It's a scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren. Every person who has more than 2 brain cells will know what is going to happen. This scene is a direct spit in the face to the bad-ass Han Solo we all know and love.

Conclusion: 

Because Disney and Abrams decided not to include George Lucas in any way this movie has no Star wars feel and no soul. It's like when an unknown Chinese manufacturer decided to make a fake iPhone. They can call it an iPhone as much as they want, but it isn't an iPhone.

CRITIQUE  
1. If you want to know what this movie is about, then simply watch Star  Wars Episode IV (A New Hope), because the story is nearly verbatim with  elements thrown in from episodes V and VI for good measure. 
2. The leads who take the rein from the old Star Wars Universe are:  Hispanic, black, and a woman. There is nothing wrong with this in and  of itself, but when it is done simply to be politically correct, then  the story suffers. I think one critic describes this best when she  said, "For the first time in Star Wars history, a franchise will be  built around the adventures of the sort of people that Hollywood  routinely overlooks: women and people of color. So even if The Force  Awakens sucks, it's made one big diverse achievement for Hollywood."  This means the only place you will see an honest review of this movie  is in the user reviews here at IMDb 
3. Luke is now Obi Wan, his long lost daughter is the new hope, and his  nephew is the new Darth Vader 
4. They broke nearly every rule established by the original Star Wars.  Jedi talent no longer takes years of training, nor does one need to be  strong with the force to hold his own in a light saber battle against a  trained Sith lord, etc. 
WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE 
There are 100 places they could have taken this story. They could have  made Jar Jar a secret Sith lord who was playing dumb all these years,  they could have worked in elements of Star Wars Rebels and made Ezra a  Sith lord, or they could have had it where Luke turned to the dark  side. I even heard early rumors that they were going to have Finn find  Luke's severed hand with a light saber in it. 
To me, it would have made the most sense to do a story where the  Republic is now the political force of the Galaxy and the First Order  are the rebels. Luke could have been training a new Jedi order and they  could have shown a growing Sith threat, with a real villain and not the  weanie in panties that we got in this movie, throughout the battles  with the First Order. They could have made Hans more distinguished  (after all he was a King and it's been 30 years, so he should have  grown up by now). Instead, we got the same Han Solo from 1975 but who  looked 40 years older and disheveled. I'm sure Harrison Ford had no  intention of doing another Star Wars movie and insisted that this would  be the last one. So he would have been killed off no matter what.  However, it could have been far less predictable and more creative and  touching. If they wanted to keep the story line they went with, then  they still could have started this way and shown how Kylo Rey was  turning to the dark side. 
Any of these would have been far better than the trash I saw tonight.  It's amazing how I could think of these story lines (as I'm sure can  1000s of other Star Wars fans) but none of the so called talented  writers, producers, and directors in Hollywood can do this? This simply  amounts to lazy writing and oversight. 
CONCLUSION 
Because everything was so predictable and the story was a rehash of  what we already saw, the movie was BORING! It's amazing how Hollywood  can continue to put out movies like this, cheat their viewers, and then  wonder in astonishment why everyone stays home to stream or pirate  movies. Maybe it's because more and more movies these days simply  support overpaid political activists whose only creative effort is to  make a political statement at the expense of entertainment. 
I'm done with Star Wars. I don't need to see episodes VIII or IX,  because I already know what is going to happen. Episode VIII and IX  will be remakes of the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with  Ren as Luke, Luke as Obi Wan, and Kylo Rey as Darth Vader. I'm sure  VIII will have the surprise statement by Kylo Rey when he battles Ren  saying, "Ren, I am your cousin," and IX will end with Ren bringing Rey  to the good side with little furry creatures celebrating in tree tops  and the ghosts of Luke and Han looking approvingly over the scene.  Yeah, been there done that, there is no sense in my wasting money or  time to do it again. 
Star Wars is Dead! Thanks Disney and Abrams and you politically correct  whackos. Thanks a lot! 
A NOTE ON POSITIVE REVIEWS 
After reading many of the positive reviews, I can only come to the  conclusion that 1/3 of them are written by hard core Star Wars fans who  will rave about anything with the "Star Wars" logo attached to it and  will refuse to their dying day that they were wrong about this movie,  1/3 by people who never saw Star Wars and accept this cheap rip off  because it is the only version of the story they have seen, and 1/3 by  studio hacks. 
The positive reviewers have also resorted to calling the negative  reviewers "Haters." It's amazing how convenient it is today for people  to throw that word around to discredit anyone who has a differing  opinion. That should tell you everything you need to know about the  character and honesty of the positives reviewers.

Have you ever disagreed with someone about the quality of a production so intensely that you've wondered if the two of you even watched the same film? I'm sorry, everyone in the world, I thought The Force Awakens was a real snoozer. I'm not surprised that my eight year old nephew loved it, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the adults I associate with aren't offended at what we've been offered by Abrams as the continuation of the world's foremost loved space epic. 

Essentially what it feels like is a reboot of the original series, except this time for kids (no surprise there, Disney), not a meaningful continuation that picks up where the originals left off. Although I did start having my doubts about my future satisfaction with the Star Wars franchise when Disney made its Star Wars paraphernalia so pervasive that one morning I found myself unconsciously buttering my toast with DeathStar Margarine Spread©. Yeahhead trip, but I got over it. 

There was virtually zero discussion within the movie itself as to what happened after episode Vl and how we got to where we are now, making this production feel like a desperate lurch to be a stand-alone and to appeal to an audience who is too young to have appreciated the Spice Girls let alone the originals. This direction may be satisfying for some, but for those of us who were expecting more will find ourselves disappointed. Furthermore, I was saddened by the obvious deficiency surrounding the exploration of the mythology of the Force. One of the elements that so intrigued viewers about the originals was the underlying spirituality and the metaphysical forces at play within the Star Wars universe; however, in this version of Star Wars Abrams seems to care more about the characters ceaselessly running away from things and having meaningless, often silly conversation (like in one scene the character Finn asks Rey in the goofiest way possible if she has a boyfriendI laughed but I was so ashamed) instead of exploring the depths of some of the most intriguing supernatural philosophy in all of moviedom. However, this fact is not surprising as the masses seem to be entertained predominantly by action, comedy, flashing lights, and explosions, not exploring the psychological latitudes of light and dark within the human soul, and definitely not sitting through slow scenes of dialogue which could (God forbid) give us an understanding of the depths of the Star Wars legend and mystery. I suppose in this regard (and in too many others) Abrams gave the people what they wanted.

Not only was the confined exploration of the Force disappointing but so was the serious lack of emotional poignancy. At no point, AT LITERALLY NO POINT, did I feel sad, frustrated, anxious, worried, or exhilarated during its belabored two hours and sixteen minutes. The characters felt like they could be potentially cloned from any PG-13 teen movie you've seen since Twilight hijacked the world and forced it's twisted, disgusting version of acceptable adolescent stereotypes upon us. You could almost swap out the light-sabers, tie-fighters, and storm troopers and you'd have a great sequel to whatever the hell number Hunger Games we're on these days (because that's how interesting the rest of the plot was). 

Another thing that really annoyed me was the way in which the galaxy was too American. Of course I get it, it was made by Hollywood IT IS American, but guys, this is supposed to be in a GALAXY FAR AWAY, so why was there very little attempt made to try and hide that? Between the all too familiar mannerisms, jokes, and language I just couldn't fully suspend my disbelief. In my opinion, the originals managed to avoid most overt use of cultural indicators, I mean sure, it's impossible to avoid all due to obvious limitations, but watch the main character Finn carefully during the movie and you'll see that he's dripping with 21st century western American dude. Like literally drenched. Where was the otherworldly authenticity among the main characters? 

Of course it wasn't all bad. The visuals were beautiful, much of the topography and effects were breathtaking, and I have to admit that I did feel pangs of nostalgia over any scene that included an X-wing, but overall it wasn't enough. Really a lot of what it comes down to is expectation. So many people have told me that they went into it not expecting too much and that they had "fun" watching it; and then there's me sitting here thinking: what on Tatooine are they talking about? With all the media hype this film received, not to mention the disappointment of the prequels, I was expecting a hell of a lot out of this movie, and simple fun ain't gonna cut it. Abrams seemed to have carved the profundity and soul out of Star Wars with a lightsaber the same soul we've been waiting to enter our lives again ever since the prequels ruined them. 

The Force Awakens was half way there, but it felt forced (pun intended), shallow, in need of a more refined plot, more mature characters, a deeper spirituality, moral complexity and depth; it needed to resonate more deeply with the IMPORTANT themes of the original, and to not have felt like a chaste teen romance with some old faces in there used like a box office tractor beam. If you're content with having your childhood favorite epic turned into a lovable, easily digestible icon of twenty-first century pop culture, marketed intentionally at young people to delight and entertain whilst simultaneously causing you to cringe at the fact that the original actors are okay with such a disservice to a beloved story, then you will enjoy the continuation of this franchise. 

May the force save us from this trilogy.

I loved all the previous star wars movies (yes, even the prequels). 

But this, this was just deeply disappointing. I could get past all the cheap/easy typical Disney humour (which is actually enjoyable in cartoons) but the plot of the movie, lack of character development, and lack of star wars was just too much.

The only thing making this movie resemble star wars were the old stars from the original movie. it was pleasant to see Han Solo, but only as a fan of the original film. Within itself, the whole Leia-Han Solo love story was completely destroyed by this movie. Their relationship seemed superficial. but it didn't really matter because there was just no time for character development or illustration of the depth of their relationship. The movie just needed to show more dull fight scenes, entirely recycled across the original trilogy. 

The meaning and depth of the force was cheapened: apparently now a storm trooper can not just use a light saber but also fight and win with a Sith Lord (who at the beginning of the film was able to stop bullets mid air, kill with the force, and read people's minds). 

The force doesn't awaken because we never see the force being forgotten. Instead the new characters at one recognize Han Solo and know everything there is to know about Skywalker: boring much?! Reminds me of a bad episode IV. 

The plot of the film is essentially going to destroy the death star.... yes the death star... BUT NO WAIT IT'S 10X BIGGER IT'S FINE. 

All in all, even writing the review is painful. I was expecting a beautifully executed movie, given the advancement of technology and funding for this. Instead I saw something so simple, I wanted to leave (during the premiere). Clearly, long gone are the days of incredible creatures, amazing costumes (shout out to Lucas). And in are the days of a cheap villain, who looks like he came straight out of a Disney princess movie: and acts the same.... 

Please, please, please improve the next movie. DO A PLOT. We can think for ourselves, I promise....

I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad. No other words for it.

Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous episodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot turns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in general. 

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER

Some basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the characters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained Sith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks with no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across considerable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters apart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless hysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side is a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels like a badly written fanfic.

END SPOILERS

And it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance of ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost here. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly choreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always thought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have been magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself thinking that "A New Hope" looked better and more advanced than this one.

Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but for those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major let down.

1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.

I hate to be the one to point this out, but in the spirit of truth the movie is complete garbage. Once you get past the real sets and practical effects, the only thing done right, this movie is simply terrible. It has no depth at all. In the prequels with bad acting, terrible special effects and lack of real sets sucked yes, but at least they had a good story.

1. The entire story is basically the original 3 films mashed together into 130 minutes of rehashed fan appeasement, no original story other then killing of Han Solo, which was rehashed from the Luke/Vader empire fight scene but far less spectacular.

2. There is absolutely no back story to the Republic or the First Order and what's been happening over the last 30 years.

3. The new bad guy is a whiny immature kid with daddy problems that throws literal temper tantrums whenever he does not get his way, even worse than the fan hated prequels.

4. The new bad guy wears a mask for no reason other than to apparently look and sound cool? I mean he takes it off and shows his face several times in the movie so it's obviously not to hide his identity. If it's for simple armor then show him only wearing it in combat and protecting him from a blaster shot to the face or something.

5. The new bad guy goes bad for seemingly no reason at all? He has his mom and dad in his life and they love him very much, yet he wants to follow in the foot steps of his evil grandfather who died before he was even born? Darth Vader went good in the end and saved Luke by killing the emperor and becoming a force ghost like Obi One, so why doesn't he just appear to his force sensitive grandson and explain the truth of what happened to him and explain to him he is being misguided by a lie!?

6. Why was Gwendoline Christie even in the film? She literally had 2 scenes more then the trailer showed and served no purpose, must be because she's a bad guy woman and that's different and cool right?

7. The 3.0 Death Star only bigger, but with the exact same weakness as the first 2 and destroyed the exact same way, really!!??

8. As this director showed in Star Trek, he does not care at all about destroying the major cornerstones of a franchise story such as having Romulus destroyed in the very beginning of his rehashed Star Trek series and killing off nearly the entire population of a fan favorite planet/race. The new bigger more powerful 3.0 death star destroys multiple planets, the entire Republic and its fleet in one shot killing billions of people!!?? 

9. Clear liberal Hollywood feminist propaganda, I don't mind a strong female lead at all! But did they have to make her a completely unrealistic super woman!? She learns she has force powers, figures out how to use said force powers by her self in what could have only been a couple days at most and beats the hell out of the multi year trained bad guy apprentice!!!

10. A waste disposal storm trooper uses a light saber no training necessary?

11. A one day old Jedi with no training can use a light saber the first day she holds it as good as a multi year trained apprentice when Luke had to train for at least months with Yoda and still had his ass kicked by Vader, must be because she's a super woman right?

12. Ray knows more about the technical aspects of the Millennium falcon and can fly it better then Hans Solo can even when she has never flown a star ship before, just like a 9 year old did in the prequels flying a fighter and destroying the droid control ship right? Oh ya she's super woman, I forgot.

Star Wars to me has always been about imagination.

There's a lot that has been said about George Lucas in the last forty years, but there's one thing that can't be denied: he had imagination.

JJ Abrams however does not and it shows in The Force Awakens. Besides the plot, which isn't original to say the least and has a lot of questionable elements, the visual design is very bland and derivative. The actual look and feel of the film reminds more of JJ's Star Trek films than of the original Star Wars trilogy, although luckily there are only a handful of lens flares to be seen.

Even the music sounds uninspired. Which is a shame since the music was always one of the strongest parts of Star Wars.

All in all it's an extremely average film, which would have been fine if it wasn't Star Wars. Star Wars is about pushing the limits and the only thing that was pushed here is your hype button.

The prequel trilogy was a misstep in a lot of aspects, but at least George tried to innovate and create something new. The Force Awakens however is a big step backwards.

A small droid carrying classified data crash lands on desert planet. Meets teenage characters. Rebel Alliance needs the data to fight the Empire's new planet-destroying weapon. Rinse and repeat.

Sound familiar? That was the plot to both Episode IV: A New Hope, and Jar-Jar Abrams latest calamity that just found its way onto cinema screens across the country.

I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to like this movie-- but alas, we got yet another one of Abrams' typical mind-numbing explosion-fests. It has ALL of Jar-Jar Abrams normal movie failings:

* A cast of characters almost entirely made up of pre-adolescents trying to play adult roles.

* Dialogue/screenplay that seems like it was written by an 8-year old.

* Nothing that even slightly resembles a plot. I am surprised Abrams didn't put "Red Matter" in this movie to fill in all the gaps between his weak story-telling and the plot loopholes it creates, like he did with Star Disaster XI.

As is the case with most of the reboots he has done to date-- Abrams lacks the creativity and writing ability to come up with an original and compelling plot on his own, so he just plagiarizes an existing story and makes "some changes" to better fit his "vision" (as in LSD-induced) of it. He props up these mindless stories by inserting a bunch of unnecessary homage moments to famous lines and clichés from the previous established films in the mythos to try and give his creation validity ("He's dead, Jim").

Really? Another movie about destroying a death star? A droid carrying the plans that the Empire wants to stop from falling into Alliance hands? How original....

He doesn't care if his stories makes sense or not, or if he breaks his own rules; in Star Trek XI, like when the Enterprise could not beam up Spock's mother (because she was falling), but later in the movie, Scotty and Kirk beamed onto the Enterprise from another solar system while it was moving at warp speed with no problems! The Force Awakens had PLENTY of these "Abrams' moments".

A wise man once told me-- "The litmus test for good and bad storytelling comes down to this: do the actions of the characters in your story fit the background and motivations you gave them in your story history? If not-- it is GARBAGE." For instance, a Romulan captain, so enraged his home planet got destroyed-- would not sit on his hands for 25 years, waiting for Spock (who, given the complexity of time travel-- might NEVER have appeared) to show up, so he can blow up the entire galaxy (obviously Abrams does not understand interstellar distances) just to show everyone just how mad he really is!! Now there is a story that will be remembered over the ages....

The actors in this movie were so poor-- it was difficult to tell what exactly their motivations, passions, and driving ideals were. They all had about as much emotional content as Hayden Christiansen (little or none) from the prequels.

* Explosions and guns ablazing, pretty much from the moment the beginning credits close until the end credits start rolling. By the time you are 5 minutes into the movie-- you are already bored and desensitized to it.

I am not surprised to find that many of the people who thought Star Trek XI and XII (the one with a Caucasian Khanoonian Singh) were good movies, also think this movie was in any way memorable (other than the humongous sense of disappointment I walked out of the theater feeling).

Jar-Jar Abrams should be banned from ruining any more legendary movie franchises. The fans themselves could have written a better story and backdrop for this film.

This is a prime example of a modern movie with stunning visuals but lame writing ...not a bad way to kill a few hours whilst stuffing your face with popcorn and playing with your phone but overhaul the story had to many stupid moments that you'd have to be utterly mindless to forgive.

There's also nothing new here and the dark side are making the same stupid mistakes they were making 30 years ago. It's almost like a remake or homage to the original films.

The two main good characters are awfully skilled in lightsaber fighting and/or using the force considering they didn't even have a clue twenty minutes earlier and had no training in either. The main bad guy despite having training from the dark side appears average against the two nobody's who suddenly have discovered their remarkable skill.

Eye candy not brain candy. It's mindless fun but too mindless...more brain dead...leaving the intelligent member's of the audience thinking, what?

The Force Awakens starts off strong and promising, introducing interesting characters like an X Wing pilot Poe Dameron, the new villain in town Kylo Ren, a Chrome Stormtrooper called Captain Phasma, and a new droid BB-8. The First Order (aka. The empire for the new generation) are after this droid, (Sound familiar?) because for some reason EVERYONE in the galaxy is after the elusive Luke Skywalker who's gone missing, and this droid is key in finding his location. So that's basically the gist of the very shallow story; FIND Luke SKYWALKWER. 

Where do I begin? Wow, this is without a doubt the weakest story in the saga thus far. It doesn't even explain WHY finding Luke is so important. 

Nothing is explained in this film. 

Our new heroes are Rey, (who plays the Luke Skywalker role of A New Hope) and Finn, basically our comedy relief character, who for whatever reason tags along for the adventure. 

Their main goal is, by the luxury of endless coincidences in this poorly thought out movie; to stop the threat that is the First Order and their SUPER DEATH STAR, (wait for it.....) STARKILLER! And also, find that old hermit Luke. 

Seriously, there are so many instances where you'll stop and think, "wow they're always there at the right time. How convenient". Such as, finding the Millennium Falcon by chance, running into Han Solo by chance, finding Luke's old lightsaber by chance, and my favourite, R2D2 waking up from low-power mode for no apparent reason other than to MOVE THIS NONSENSICAL PLOT ALONG! 

Kylo Ren's character is ruined when he takes off his mask. You can't take him seriously anymore, he was a legit badass for the first hour of the movie, but that's all destroyed. 

Han Solo's death was the ONLY emotional part in the film. He dies by his son Kylo Ren's lightsaber, that everyone saw a mile away was going to happen, very predictable but it was sad to see him go. HOWEVER, the way that he falls off the platform looks ridiculous and I actually laughed out loud at how stupid it looked. 

The last third of the film is where I realized I was watching a parody. It is literally beat for beat, Episode IV and VI combined. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A trench run to destroy Death Star 3 (the starkiller) and an underwhelming lightsaber duel between insta-Jedi Rey and Kylo Ren. As many others have said, if you've seen A New Hope, you've seen this movie, but that movie was actually good. 

And lastly, the ending... I cannot put into words how bad the ending is... It is so bad... It is easily the WORST ending in the saga. After all that, the movie ends with Rey handing over the lightsaber to Luke (who's green screened into the shot BTW, looks super fake) and the two engage in a cringe worthy awkward staring contest with no words being spoken... 

And it was at that moment where I laughed the hardest ever at a SW film.

Was that a parody I just witnessed? 

LAUGHINGLY BAD.

There may be some spoilers, even though I have done my best to avoid them! 

I am a big fan of the OT, and like many fans was disappointed by the silly prequels. I felt excited for this new trilogy, and hoped JJ Abrams was going to be able to give us new stories to propel the series forward. After the prequels, at least there was the hope of someone new coming in and renewing the sense of magic and wonder that have been the very soul of the OT. Now this hope has been extinguished. Disney has put so much effort into safely making money (a lot of it, too), from the cash cow that is Star Wars, that they have stifled any creativity that could have made this movie great. 

For more detail read below :

I saw the movie last night, and here are its best and worst moments.

What worked: 

1. Imagery - hands down, awesome visuals, but that is to be expected given how much this movie must have cost to make. 

2. The new droid, BB8 is cute 

3. There was no Jar Jar Binks :) 

4. Some humor, still falling a bit flat of the original 

5. The reunion of Han Solo and Chewbacca, those two were as great as ever

What did not work (for me)

1. The weak story - practically a rehash or the "A New Hope" plot, but without the freshness and creativity that made the original work so well. Throughout the whole movie I had the feeling of "been there, done that", and ended up being bored. I mean, we are destroying the Death Star for a third time now, really? Ooooh, but this time it is bigger. And we are again hiding a secret information in a droid?. Snooze. 

2.The main characters. What worked so well in the OT was they had introduced very charismatic characters and they also took the time to develop them and give us reasons to care for them. The creation of bonds of friendship and camaraderie between Han, Luke and Leia happened organically, made sense and was justified. The three new leads try to display the same, but it feels forced as nothing in the story should have lead them to feel that way about each other. I could not bring myself to are about Poe, or Rey or Finn, so not sure how they will carry the franchise forward 

3. Weak villains who do not project enough danger for the Resistance. I admit, it must be hard to equal, let alone top, such awesome villains as Lord Vader or the Emperor. Still, the new villains, Supreme Commander Snoke, Kylo Ren and Hux come across as average wanna-bees and do not provide the necessary feel of dread, to make us feel threatened. 

4. Weak script. I had high hopes after I learned Lawrence Kasdan was writing the script, but my hopes were unfounded. In the OT each main character was given a very compelling reason why they were involved with the rebels. For Leia, it was because of her father, Luke saw his family killed, and Han, after his initial resistance, had fallen for Leia and had come back to rescue Luke during the raid against the Death Star. In this new movie, there was no compelling reason for Finn, and ex-storm trooper, to somehow overcome being brainwashed and conditioned to kill and develop high moral principles and sense of humor. For Rey, there was no compelling reason to rescue BB8 in the desert. Poe was already with the resistance, but feeling all buddy-buddy with Finn happened all of a sudden, more because of "well the main characters are supposed to be like that" rather than any sense-making reason 

5. No character development. I cannot believe that they had such golden opportunity to introduce the new leads who should have been these new interesting characters, and they did nothing to develop them and make us feel any sense of camaraderie with them! I mean, Finn, trying to overcome his storm trooper conditioning; Rey going from a desert scavenger to something more; Kylo Ren's insecurities, his volatility and his rivalry with Hux - all of these could have been used to give us some memorable moments, and instead were wasted. 

6. Things happening too quickly and in a forced way. Remember how Luke had to train to access the Force and gain any control over it? Remember Ben Kenoby, a seasoned Jedi, using Jedi mind tricks? Well the new Jedi uses these things without any training at all, it all just happens out of nowhere 

7. Musical score. The Star Wars theme is easily one of the most epic, amazing movie scores ever written. If I had not wanted to be a Jedi so bad, just the Imperial march alone would have made me join the Dark Side :))) So I was hoping we were going to get some more musical awesomeness, after all, it did happen for the sucky prequels, right? Not so here. To my disappointment, there was no awesome First Order theme, no nothing. It pains me so much to say that, because in my mind John Williams is and will remain the greatest movie composer ever

I had high hopes for "Star Wars : The Force Awakens" (SW7). Unfortunately, JarJarAbrams did was he often does, namely "adopt, disrespect and destroy the work of others".

SW7 was absolutely horrible. No wonder Disney super-hyped the film and let nobody review in advance.

Anyone who cares about story, originality, coherence and consistency will find SW7 horrible. SW7 feels like it was written and directed by a simple-minded high-school student.

The good news: JarJarBinks wasn't a character in SW7.

The bad news: Someone with a JarJarBinks mindset wrote and directed SW7.

SW7 is an incoherent ripoff, reboot, remake mishmash of the original trilogy (OT), namely SW4, SW5, SW6.

SW7 is stunning in its lack of creativity and originality. The writers forgot the classic phrase is "history never repeats, but often rhymes". It would be fine for SW7 to rhyme with the OT, but instead SW7 simply repeats with minor irrelevant tweaks.

Most action in SW7 is simply action for action sake. Not because story, characters or the universe of StarWars demands the action, but because someone thought "this action should be cool". Much action wasn't set up or explained, and made no sense.

Some infantile mind (almost certainly JJA) wanted his DeathStar to be bigger and badder than those created by George Lucas. So the new DeathStar is 10 times larger... and explodes 7 planets at a time. Were those 7 planets established? Nope. Were their significance established? Nope. The new DeathStar weapon is charged by sucking all the energy from the nearest sun, then blasts 7 planets. This sure didn't make the new DeathStar more difficult to blow up. Sigh. Plus, why bother? Once you extinguish the sun, everyone on every planet in the solar system would freeze to death.

After two DeathStars were blown up in the OT, you'd think the empire would realize investing so much time, effort and resources into huge spherical space-stations was a bad idea. But no... that would require the writers actually imagine something creative and original, and dare I say "fresh and new". Nope. SW7 did exactly what a simple-minded child with no creative ability would do - create another DeathStar, only much more cumbersome and absurd.

BTW, why explode 7 planets simultaneously? Especially since the one planet that didn't get exploded the first time was the only planet that mattered. Made no sense whatsoever. Most planets in most solar systems cannot support life anyway, so the whole notion is completely absurd. But a simple-minded child only thinks "bigger and badder is better", and never wonders whether their idea makes any sense. Cue JarJarAbrams... brainless child in an adult body.

An enormous percentage of the SW7 story made no sense, contradicted what we know of the StarWars universe, or was completely unexplained and thus seemed like complete nonsense. I'll mention just one of dozens of examples to illustrate.

Rey is a compelling 20-ish tomboy without background (grew up alone on a desert planet, never knowing her parents). She gets caught up in the action of the story and flies off with Finn (a storm-trooper turned good) in an "old junker" spaceship (Han Solo's old spaceship). Amazingly, minutes later, after years of searching Han and Chewie find his ship and "steal it back". How convenient was that?

Later, Rey yanks Luke's lost light-saber out of the snow 30 meters away with the force (that she doesn't know she has, and while a Sith is also trying to grab it from much closer). Rey then handily beats the Sith in a light saber fight... with zero prior training or experience. So much for Jedi needing years of training. Even worse, Rey pulls the classic "Jedi mind trick" on a StormTrooper to escape from the new DeathStar... even though she never heard of "Jedi mind tricks" before.

Anyone who knows the StarWars universe has to think, "Are you kidding me"? How does this girl become stronger with the force than any Jedi who ever existed... with no training or prior connection to the force? This is beyond absurd, as is the entire story.

After a day reflecting, I speculated, "Maybe Rey is Luke's daughter, maybe Luke trained her, then maybe Luke stranded her on a desert planet much like Tatooine after erasing her memory". Such pure speculation could at least explain some of these absurdities, but nothing in the movie provided us any insight or reason to believe her abilities made any sense whatsoever. In fact, it directly contradicts what we know from previous films.

Incessant action and motion made locations seem small, contained, largely meaningless. All previous StarWars films, especially the prequels, presented the awesome grandeur and scope of the locations (cities, moons, planets, galaxy) the story and action were set within. Except for the empty desert where Rey lived, SW7 did none of this. Even when we quickly fly into the huge hanger in the new DeathStar we barely see anything (no establishing shots). SW7 doesn't feel set "in a galaxy", but "a few spots on 3 planets and the DeathStar", and logical connections between locations are rarely established.

The story has endless holes and lapses of consistency and continuity, not to mention utter absurdities (like huge dog leashes attached to tie-fighters inside the DeathStar).

The new characters were fine, and most acting was solid, even excellent sometimes (Han). However, the way Han Solo dies is utterly absurd and totally meaningless. Plus, he and Leia had ZERO chemistry (apparently they were long divorced, plus Leia ends up getting Han killed). The special effects were mostly competent, but were TOTALLY WRONG in style for StarWars.

SW7 does provide setups that could lead to good SW8 and SW9 stories. JarJarAbrams isn't writing or directing SW8 or SW9 apparently, so at least we might have "a new hope" for SW8 and SW9. Convince George Lucas to write the stories for all future Star Wars films.

The Snore Awakens! This movie is a poorly done rehash of the original trilogy and conveniently ignores everything that everyone knows about what happens after Return of the Jedi. 30 years later and everyone is doing the exact same thing? Did time just stop while everyone was away? Throwing in mediocre acting and poor character development (learning everything you need to know about a character in 15 seconds flat! Well, in Poe's case, they even outright tell you what you need to know in writing before you see him for the first time. how efficient!) which detracts from the movie even more.

Scene after scene are stale and predictable with you saying to yourself over and over "hey, this is another repeat of X scene, oh, that is another repeat of Y scene!" and it gets truly yawn-worthy. Hunting for droids in the desert just like the beginning of the episode 4. The x-wings barreling down the ravine like the first death star. Han and Chewie setting charges to lower the shield like the moon of endor. Black leader breaching the structure and flying around inside blowing up the interior like the 2nd death star. Walking into the strange bar just like Mos Eisley. /facepalm

Not to mention the entire movie is built on coincidences. Oh look, the first order shows up right when you are handed the map. Oh look, your droid just happens to pass by Rey. Oh look, the millennium falcon just happens to be sitting there. Oh look, Han and Chewie just happen to be there to find you. Oh look, Luke's lightsaber happens to be right there for you to find. Oh look, you learn how to use the force in 20 seconds flat and escape. How handy, Kylo just happens to be there. What a coincidence, Kylo doesn't remember that he is a dark Jedi and can simply burst Finn's organs with a single word. It just never ends.

It just makes my head hurt like you can't imagine. All they did was flip-flop content from the original star wars around. It isn't an orphaned boy named Luke, now it's an orphan girl named Rey. The desert planet is no longer tatooine, it is now Jakku. The droid sidekick isn't R2-D2, it is BB-8. Instead of fighting for the rebellion, now it is the resistance. The enemy isn't the empire, now it is the First Order. Their superweapon isn't a moon, now it is a planet. It doesn't destroy planets, but entire star systems. It isn't Darth Vader killing the mentor Obi-Wan, now Kylo Ren killed Han. It just keeps going and going, the train wreck only gets worse the longer you watch.

And we aren't even getting into the subliminal messages/programming. Rey's big phallic black staff that she carries everywhere? The demonized white male villains as angry supremacists? They could have been a little less blatant about it. I know it is important to push certain agendas in Hollywood, but give me a break.

Summary: They wiped their butts with star wars. Congratulations.

Bring back George Lucas. All is forgiven!!!

Makes the Prequels look like masterpieces!

I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this movie. Like a lot of Fans here, I have been waiting to see the further adventures of Luke, Han, and Leia again since 1983 (32 years) when I saw 'Return Of The Jedi' just before starting high school. And this is the rub... There is no adventure for them. And there never will be now. The dream is over!!!

The one thing all fans of the originals wanted to see was all three of them together again on screen at the same time. I will say that again! 

'The one thing all fans of the originals wanted to see was all three of them together again on screen at the same time.'

At least once! Well, that never happens. You only see Luke at the end for about 30 seconds, and he doesn't even speak. Han is killed off pathetically. And Leia is hardly in it. We find out that the big romance between Han and Leia didn't work out. You find out hardly anything about what happened to any of them over the years, apart from Han and Leia splitting up due to their son (let's not even mention that sorry excuse for a villain) turning to the dark side. 

There was so many things wrong with this movie, I can't begin to tell you. It's easier just to say there was nothing right with it. I will watch the others, simply because I have seen every movie on the cinema so far. However, for me it is dead! They can't make up for this in episodes 8 and 9, no matter what they do. It is truly awful. I wanted to walk out. 

I wonder how much Harrison Ford had to do with this being a monstrosity? After all, it is no secret he wanted to be killed of in 'The Empire Strikes Back' so he could do other things. He has a huge ego. He only done this movie because he was promised another Indiana Jones movie. Did he also stipulate that he wanted to be the main star of this? Forcing Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher into the sidelines?

Anyway, All I want now is for the originals to be released on Blu Ray in their original theatrical versions (without any changes). Then I can sell my other Blu Ray Box Set, and pretend that nothing else was ever made.

Biggest movie disappointment of my life. Nothing will ever come close. 

STAR WARS IS NOW DEAD!!!!!!!!

So. I was under the impression, that this was supposed to be a sequel, not a remake. It markets itself as a sequel, so there is no reason to think of it as a reboot. Yet the plot and the characters were recycled from the old movies.

A Darth Vader wannabe, with a plan from ep. IV, a re-gendered Luke with god mode powers turned on, female Yoda 2.0, etc. Whole scenes were remade. The plot was copy-pasted and yet they somehow managed to make it inconsistent. The characters were terribly profiled. I found storm trooper kid totally laughable. Over-powered Rey was just the icing on this disgusting cake. The acting was terrible, but even Orson Welles couldn't make these fan-fic level characterizations work.

This movie is beyond unoriginal. It is just saddening how well received this over-hyped piece of crap was. It makes me think that it's enough to tell people what they're supposed to like, to give some money to reviewers and everything's gonna be OK for you.

A disappointing movie in itself and as a cultural phenomenon. One of my greatest cinematographic disappointments. Then again: makes me appreciate the prequels just a little bit more. Although they were terrible movies, they brought tons of new stuff to the table. I can't think of anything original, this movie has brought, and lemme tell you: IT FEELS FRIGGIN' DEPRESSING! Is this ENOUGH for movie-goers and critics? THIS?! I hate this movie with all of my heart, but I can't bring myself to give it less than 4/10, because it is technically well made. On a very crude technical level... Even with 4/10 though, I never quite hated any movie like this one. I hate it with a passion. Been giving people thumbs up merely for hating it because I think that it's got far too much praise. It ran one of the most original franchises into stale, unoriginal, politically correct derivative waters.... God I hate this movie so much, along with everything it represents, it makes me wanna cry.

Abrams has done to Star Wars exactly what he did to Star Trek and to many people that will be good news. 

The original Star Trek TV series and films connected with a lot of people on a very deep level. Abrams' reboot turned it into something that was very likable and fun. Just not very deep. It had a likable cast and was an enjoyable experience for many, but was ultimately pretty forgettable. Much the same review could be given to the Force Awakens.

The movie is perfectly average. Nothing that will make you hate it. But nothing that will connect and resonant with audiences like the original trilogy.

Some positives - 

- Harrison lifts the movie from the moment he appears.

- The two leads, while not instantly likable, are not unlikable either. And despite most of the attempts at comedy falling flat, they grow on you as the film progresses.

Some negatives - 

- The lead villain was set up very poorly. Once he starts showing flaws he becomes a lot more interesting. It's just a pity they tried to set him up as a 'bad-ass' from the start. If he had been shown to be conflicted from the start then I wouldn't have spent the first half thinking how he wasn't quite pulling his bad-ass routine off. Of course the answer comes mid-way - he's not supposed to. 

- Han and Leia referring to Rylo as "our son" felt weird and forced. 

- The story beats and comedy felt poorly timed. Such as when Rey uses a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper - The sequence ends with a joke when she tells him to drop his weapon. The joke is that she's just learned to use the force, and just starting to grasp its power, decides last second to get him to give her his weapon too. So as he's leaving she adds the request, "Also, drop your weapon". The punchline is that he drops his weapon. And that's all that's needed. But Abrams has him repeat her request, "I'll also drop my weapon." and shows him drop it. It's hitting the nail on the head and is the sort of comedy found in many Disney channel comedies. Any good director or editor would have cut it. Showing Rey with a blaster in the next scene would have let the audience get the joke without being told the joke. 

That's not the only time this comic mistiming happens either. Rey asks Finn, "What do these monsters look like?" They turn a corner and see one eating someone. And run. That's the joke. But Finn is given the line, "They look like that", just in case anyone didn't get it. 

It's unnecessary and symptomatic of the problems I have with Abrams style of film-making. He leaves no audience member behind. And it's at the expense of any clear and original vision. There were really no surprises in this film. Nothing to expanded your mind or excited your imagination. Just a lot of fan service with perfectly serviceable action sequences. 

Despite how disappointed I was when I saw George Lucas' prequel trilogy, he at least made his films with an open heart. And they contained moments that I thought I would like to watch again. The Force Awakens has none of that for me. And while I don't regret seeing it, I don't feel I ever need to see it again. However the Star Wars universe has a huge appeal to millions of people and everybody likes different aspects of the films and mythology that surrounds them so your level of enjoyment may vary.

An early joke I did like, was Rylo's "The droid stole a freighter?" However, the joke did not fit here. At this point we were still supposed to think he was a 'bad-ass' so the joke felt weird coming from him. It could have still worked if another character had said it, or if they set Rylo's character up as who he actually ended up being (i.e. conflicted, with some weaknesses and not yet at full power). But it was another mistimed story beat.

Another example - Han Solo's speech about how the events of the original trilogies 'was real, all of it' would have been so much more powerful if it had been delivered to two very skeptical characters. But they had already recognized who he was at that point. 

One other thing that bugged me - The First Order is looking for Luke. That's all they're doing at that point. They discover a droid with a map to him. It's an obvious plot device. Fine. The original trilogy had those too. "I'll send a squad" they say. A squad? Which turns out to be a few troopers and a couple of Ties. And then are surprised when their squad doesn't do the job while hundreds of troopers with Tie Fighters sit in a space ship orbiting above the planet. So much of it feels a little forced for the sake of the story. People are sent to do tasks just so they're out of the room so another scene can take place. It comes across as a little lazy and I feel is a symptom of how much they have tried to rush these to production. (As much as I'm looking forward to seeing Rian Johnson's take on Episode VIII, I'm really worried that it's due soon.) 

Sure George Lucas pulled the same tricks we see in this film but the way he presented it made it feel original. And got an audience invested. Abrams is largely trading off the goodwill many of the audience has toward Star Wars going in. If this was a stand-alone film with nothing Star Wars related, it would be incredibly average to a lot of people.

Never felt the need to review a movie before but thought i had to spread the word that this reboot is beyond terrible. I went in with an open mind and hoped jj Abrams would restore my faith in the franchise after the terrible prequels. 

Instead i got another rehashed,regurgitated story like we have seen recently in so many other rebooted franchises such as ;terminator,the hobbit, spider-man etc.

This was made apparent when it became obvious that the plot was directly lifted from episode 4 and nothing new or original was created. What was delivered was some lame sand planet which was a direct copy of tattonine and a death planet that was 50x bigger than the original death star but was still easily destroyed by a small group of xwings.

Just like myself it seems the empire have not learned from their mistakes about the problem with building death stars and i have learned nothing about spending money to watch reboots.

Han solo dies which as my friend mentions to me is a metaphor for lovers of the old trilogy watching this piece of crap movie.

Under Disney ownership and with hacks such as JJ Abrams (with creative input from Simon Pegg...God help us) at the helm now, unfortunately Star Wars has been reduced to yet another Transformers/Marvel mindless action, zero plot franchise designed purely to reach the widest possible audience. The legacy of the iconic characters of the OT (particularly Luke) have been reduced to the point of them being almost unrecognizable losers. The previous six film story arc has been completely undermined to say the least and the mystique and nature of the Force simplified, dumbed down and instant.

The endless coincidences, JJs nonsensical, deus ex machina story, riddled with plot holes, absurd pacing and editing (which explains John Williams difficulty to nail the score), lack of character development/backstory, so on and so on. The bastardization of SW universe laws and the basic fact that this was supposed to be Episode VII in a seamless saga, but instead we were coned and sold a forgettable reboot was utterly unforgivable. But alas it's a huge commercial hit and the mob sing its praises. But without Lucas, it's just spaceships and lasers.

****************THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ********************** The plot copies the original episode IV to the letter. There is even the same environment of the desert planet, literally the same ship and almost-the-same droid with secret but vital information. Which is actually alright - yes, it is reboot rather than a sequel. Yes, it was as unoriginal as possible. But that would alright.... if it wasn't for the main cast.

The fact that the movie copied the story of episode IV made it impossible to not directly compare the cast. In short, instead of the serious and focused old cast, we got teenagers with mental problems. So lets check: 

Rey - I actually felt bad about watching her in the movie, because it felt like watching a child being abused. The way the character was made and acted in the movie was befitting a 14-16 year old. With not only looks, but also all the indecisiveness, attitude imbalance and childishness that would fit a confused high schooler. I guess I'm just too old for this. Hopefully, the directors will let her grow up for the next episode so she may start giving the feel of a heroine she was supposed to be.

Finn - If this was supposed to be the new Jar-Jar Binks, then it was a partial success. Partial, because even Jar-Jar wasn't this pathetic. Finn is cowardly, ever-confused, lying and just... useless. The feeling this character left me with was that he was useless, from the first scene to the last. It almost looked like he will build up to doing something useful, but nope. That didn't happen. He had a last chance for redemption by dying at the end to be replaced for the next movie, but even that seems to have not happened. Was this seriously supposed to be the new Han Solo? 

Kylo Ren - This one started well. Heartless, capable.. a true sith. But then through the movie he was continually forgetting about the powers he had in the first scene, to the point where was easily defeated by the above-mentioned teenage girl in a way that was actually believable (two kids clumsily waving lightsabers at each-other). During the process of forgetting about his powers, he also managed to lose his cool looking mask and showcase that we were wrong thinking he is an actual villain as he turned out to be a childish young man with serious anger issues. See the difference - when Darth Vader was unsatisfied with the progress, he killed the soldiers in a cool and threatening manner. This kid destroyed his own computer instead...

cpt. Phasma - The Boba Fett 2.0 also started well. But then got demolished in a 1 on 1 ship fight against the ancient millennium falcon piloted by a high school girl who had never done it before. Right. While one could have thought that it was the end to the humiliation of the character, it wasn't. Later she got captured by Chewbakka, betrayed her First Order without even needing to be threatened and was thrown into a dumpster. At least somebody met a fitting end.

The new sith lord - The cool thing about the old emperor Palpatino was his secret identity, masked face and general feeling of power. Now we got a villain whose name is both completely forgettable and generally known... so much for secrecy. On top of that, he uses a giant hologram to overcompensate the clear lack of actual influence and has a twisted face that looks a lot like muts from the last hunger games. Seriously? On the plus side, the soundtrack was amazing and scenes were really well set up and made. At least until the new protagonists entered them.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

I can't believe I'm saying this, but this movie makes me miss George Lucas. I think we all owe George a huge apology. I didn't care much for the prequels at all, but at least they were original and you can tell there is a passion behind the story and the film-making. You can clearly tell episode 7 was made by the Disney corporate 'machine' and is aimed at leaching money from our nostalgic wallets. 

The fans got exactly what they asked for. That is, if they were looking for a movie with Stormtroopers, check. A death star with a vulnerability that can be easily exposed, check. Explosions, check. Numerous chase scenes, check. A story that works around all the above requirements and does nothing to explain what is going on or what our beloved characters have been doing the last 30 years, check. 

About an hour in, I felt it was obvious that the movie was rushed and story be damned. Another death star assault? Another cantina scene? (neither which come close to the originals and were totally rushed through) Rey basically becomes a Jedi over the course of 5-10 mins? Poe and Finn become best pals and create a strong brotherly bond after knowing each other for what, 7 mins? I was shocked at how rushed this movie was to accomplish some of its plot goals. 

Oh, and there is just as much, or more CGI in this film than the prequels, don't be fooled. Truth is, practical effects take much more time and effort than CGI, and again, this movie feels very rushed, so this should be no surprise. Shooting this movie on film was also a waste of time as it might as well been digital. I mean seriously, for all of the talk about being careful and using CGI sparingly, we somehow get a scene involving 4 terribly over CGI'd tentacle equipped aliens that chase our heroes about 30  40 mins into the movie. I think it was one of the worst scenes in any Star Wars movie, period. There are also a few CGI characters (Snoke, the Junk Dealer, Maz) that were totally unnecessary to be CGI, but they did it anyway. 

***BIGGEST SPOILER OF ALL TIME BELOW***

How Han Solo was handled was so disappointing. And whatever was done in this regard was going to draw a strong reaction from the fans. And sure, I know Harrison Ford doesn't want to be in the whole trilogy and you all know that he will come to an end in this movie. But the manner in which he meets his end is so tragic in how bad it is. The greatest and most beloved hero of the Star Wars universe dies without a fight, but with a whimper and is then just discarded like a piece of trash. It was an insult to his character. We waited 30 years for THAT? Why bother? It just seemed like a real FU to fans of the original trilogy as in 'You like your Han Solo do you, he's your favourite character and the only redeemable part in this mess of a movie, right? Well, we're going kill him in the most cowardly, pathetic, ill-conceived way we can. The Mouse is in charge now, screw your original trilogy!" 

I just don't know why they bothered to have the original heroes in this movie at alloh wait, I know why, to get a bunch of nostalgic Star Wars fans to shell out their hard earned space bucks in order for Disney to recoup its $4 billion investment asap! Business is business and this movie screams it and reminds you constantly every time the plot is advanced and important details are glossed over.

It saddens me to be so negative about this as I love Star Wars and really like JJ Abrams and I also think Lawrence Kasdan is a genius. All I can think is that Disney had way too much say in the end product in order to satisfy their long term plan of releasing a new film every year, and new toys, books, games, etc. They will ensure this franchise will speak to the lowest common denominator and ensure Star Wars becomes just 'another franchise' in their stable of acquired (and extremely lucrative) franchises.

I tend to view the Star Wars saga as more than just a story; but as a culmination of concepts and ideas (drawn heavily from Eastern mythological and philosophical thought processes). By this I mean the following:

1. The Force is a collective consciousness which permeates every living thing. It has no shape, form, smell or touch, but can be felt on metaphysical level. People who are able to harness the power of the Force have to undergo intensive training and attain the highest form of control over their minds.

2. The saga does not simply look at "Good vs. Evil" but also at the Good in Evil (Darth Vader) and the Evil in Good (Anakin Skywalker) - something which more accurately defines the grey nature of human character.

3. Darth Vader constantly talks about the completion of events that were destined to happen. This is a strong reference to the cyclical concept of time as understood in Indian philosophy.

When I look at all the 7 Episodes in the three different Trilogies that they have been released in, I surmise that Parts IV, V and VI were concept-based. Parts I, II and III were less concept-based and more story-based. However, since part III ultimately had to merge into Part IV, the Trilogy was sill anchored to the concepts. Part VII, however, disregarded the concepts portrayed by Lucas completely and focused on just a story to make it "sell".

For all the following reasons, I feel that Episode VII is simply a bastardization of not just the concepts built up in Parts IV, V and VI, but also a desecration of the story built up by all six prequels:

1. There is no respect for the Force. What took Anakin and Luke intensive training to master was achieved by Rey instantly at the exact time when she needed it most. Further, people in whom the Force is strong are recognized by their quick reflexes and ability to see a little into the future; not by their ability to instantly manipulate minds and move objects at will.

2. There is no respect for the Dark Side of the Force. Even though Kylo may have still been in training stage, he was apparently powerful enough to command forces of the First Order. However, he was portrayed as an incompetent rookie who slashed out idiotically with his saber at disappointing news and who was smirked at by the General. Disney has disparaged the Force and the Dark Side of the Force as mere magic tricks which get you out of a sticky situation or which can give an "interesting" twist to a plot which has already been milked dry.

3. Disney has just milked the "relation" card. Just because Luke turning out to be Vader's son was a huge commercial success, Disney had to make Kylo the son of Han and Leia. 

4. The characters are two-dimensional (at least in this Episode). Finn is a cliché example of a "trained killer who suddenly gets a conscience" and Kylo is just a rehash of Anakin Skywalker's story. I do not want to comment on Rey's character because her back-story is not revealed in its entirety in this part. 

In conclusion, I would never recommend a Star Wars fan to watch this movie.

First of all: the tempo. Everything went way too fast, every scene was cut off before you could really take it all in. Big part of the appeal of SW to me is the big landscapes, that entire, weird, strange and beautiful universe. They didn't show that at all, it all felt so tiny, like a TV-show.

The prequels were pretty bad, but that's at least one thing they did better: that majestic, grand SW-feeling.

Then, the story: what a mess. Everybody is looking for Luke Skywalker? Why? Shouldn't the republic concentrate itself on the giant evil First Order that's rising? And what the hell is 'the resistance'? What are they 'resisting'? The First Order? If the republic is in power, wouldn't it be a better idea to create a huge army and crush the First Order, instead of creating some 'resistance' that seems to have limited power and resources? The map: what the hell? Some guy has a tiny piece of it? Why? Who is that guy? Did Luke gave him a piece of the map were he is? Why would he do that? And then put another part n R2D2? What the hell? Is he going senile? Is he playing some weird game? Come look for me, hahaha. Here's a piece, there's a piece.

The entire story felt silly and contrived, it felt like a ride in an amusement park, not like a movie. Harisson Ford was alright. I think I liked the second act the most, there were at least some scenes that were a little bit slower.

Rey was a blank slate. Just this random girl that kept running across the screen, grinning, shouting, fixing things, crying. Like a Disney Princess on speed that had wandered into the wrong movie.

Nothing was ever explained. Stuff just kind of 'happened'.

And then 'the Force'. Oh my God, the Force. Now they really did it. Lucas came pretty close to killing it with his stupid Midichlorians-idea. But in this movie they take it to a whole other level.

There's actually this scene between Finn and Solo where Finn says: 'It's alright, we'll use the Force!' And then Solo kind of indignantly says: 'That's not how the Force works!' I think the filmmakers actually realized they were messing things up on a major scale and that scene was some sort of Freudian excuse, because in their movie, that's exactly how the Force works.

They took this spiritual concept and dumbed it down so much that is embarrassing. It reminded me of a King of Queens episode in which Doug and Carry start praying for a new dress to be on discount or for the last pork chop to be not taken away by another customer, because they think it actually works.

Just close your eyes for a few seconds and 'few', there you go. No weight to it, nothings special. And the way they talk about the dark side and the light side, it's so extremely silly, like they talk about going to McDonald's or Burgerking.

It was very American and very now, and not at all that otherworldly universe from long ago. Star Wars, the twenty-first century Disney-kids version, with instant Jedi and the depth of a tablespoon.
