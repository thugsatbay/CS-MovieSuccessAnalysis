### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
After some moments of silence, the master of the sixth generation of Chinese filmmakers, Jia Zhangke returns with his newest feature "A Touch of Sin" (2013) which might just be his darkest work to date. It's an intriguing film of sheer brilliance told through the complexity of several, loosely connected stories about people in agony. While some fans of the director may be disappointed by the lack of clairvoyant lyric beauty, characteristic for example for "Still Life" (2006), others may find the narrative ambiguity and incoherence rather enriching. 

The film begins with an enigmatic scene at a deserted rural highway where a truck carrying tomatoes has fallen over. A cold sense of brutality breathes in the air. Soon the first characters are introduced and we learn that, in the same way as in "Still Life", "A Touch of Sin" is structured from different stories with different human fates. In brief, it tells the story of four random acts of violence in today's society.

Although the stories lack obvious connection, they all share a few essential elements. First of all, they all escalate to an outburst of violence. Second, all of them are tales of social rootlessness and existential alienation. The latter remark is congruous with the fact that in all of Zhangke's films the general aspect meets the particular in a poignant fashion of chill and solitude. Individuals live in their personal prisons while the modernization of the society brings nothing but empty freedom. In other words, they live in spaces that are both private and public where they feel utterly detached. No one belongs anywhere in the Zhangke universe. 

Due to the complexity of several stories, the film also includes more than one central milieu. However, this seemingly arbitrary set of different settings of hotels and a coal miners' town do tell us about veritably similar subjects. All the spaces are haunted by the same problems. Such conflict of ambiguity and coherence should not frighten the spectator. Since instead of a straight-forward narrative with clear character delineation, Zhangke offers us a fascinatingly cynical cross-section of the contemporary Chinese society which is, on the one hand, characterized by economic boom to whose technological wonderland an individual may vanish, and, on the other, the tormenting but also comforting legacy of Mao. 

Modern Chinese way of life appears to Zhangke as something diverse -- as something that is in a constant state of change. Like in his previous features, Zhangke once again focuses on the transforming reality, the current flow, and its consequences on the individuals. Although this was already done to an extent in "Still Life" through the complexity of two overlapping stories, it also cast hope in humanity, whereas "A Touch of Sin" is far more pessimistic. 

Once again Zhangke's aesthetics of cinema is characterized by the elements of silence and emptiness in the images of loneliness and alienation. It is as though everything had died. Only violence is portrayed passionately, all the rest is understated. The violence in "A Touch of Sin" is raw and brutal, but essentially stripped. Above all, violence appears as a melancholic undertone of some kind which reveals the realities of the society. 

Even if the opaque and complex narrative of "A Touch of Sin" left the viewer speechless and unable to describe what he or she had just seen, there is always something profound to admire in Zhangke's cinema. In his films there is always that certain mood which is quite difficult to be put in words. In brief, it is a mood of emptiness, but also of utter richness.

after finally watching A Touch Of Sin this evening at ACMI with some friends, it's left me stuck in 2 worlds - missing Jia Zhang-Ke's meditative & lyrical work of the past & liking the new approach to these social wrongs in a more brutal / violent / cynical manner... 

first thoughts were quite similar to when i watched another master film maker Kim Ki-Duk's "Pieta" which after further digestion, thought & reading became my fave film of 2013 - both films show violence in a heavy way but still portray it in a meditative & profound manner, using symbolic moments to remind the audience about these issues... 

in hindsight i really like this film and where Jia is going with his approach... considering this is a narrative driven film over his powerful and thought provoking documentaries, all the killings were based on real events the director read in blogs... the film is a vessel to show these separate events as one about alienation, the varying classes in china & corruption / political flaws... 

here's a good article from Slant which covers a lot of how i feel towards the films - 8/10

While cinema should have elements of universal appeal, to appreciate "A Touch of Sin" it's useful to have some sense of Chinese society and history. Many of the elements in A Touch of Sin would resonate well with a Chinese audience, but I'm afraid most Westerners wouldn't catch them. The very fact that dialogue in each scenario is conducted in a very distinctive (mutually unintelligible) local dialect is totally missed by the English subtitles (indeed, in China, the film would need standard Mandarin subtitles!)-- but the issue of dialect and local origins in a 'wanderer's society" like China would have a huge impact on the Chinese viewing audience.

Other reviewers mention that when violence occurs, bystanders don't seem to have any reaction -- this can be seen as a direct homage to the great Lu Xun (China's foremost modernist writer of the 1920s) who claimed that his very entry into the world of literature was inspired by a photograph of a public execution in China --where gawking bystanders in the background of the photo had no reaction to the violence happening before them. Similarly, the "assassination at the temple" (first story) can be seen as a direct reference to the famous 1935 assassination of the notorious Shanghai warlord Sun Chuanfang as he was praying in a Buddhist temple (an assassination that was seen as totally righteous and virtuous by the Chinese public at the time). And finally -- the very existence of the Chinese Communist Party, and the entire People's Republic of China -- is due to an ideology that the social injustices caused by capitalism must be solved by violence. (Think Dahai's killing spree, but on a mass scale). If you want to know why the film is not shown in China, think no further than this!!

We always analyze Western films within their cultural and historical contexts....to not do so with non-Western films does an injustice to the film and the film-maker.

Highs: A Touch of Sin consists in four different stories that are loosely connected with each other chronologically. It's interesting how they all explored violence and evil in distinct manners. The first segment was by far the most explosive and brutal one. It's basically an extreme revenge story where you initially really feel sympathy for the character of Dahai, who gets humiliated, hurt and exploited by others until he's completely lost in the darkness. This segment had a strong emotional punch, but also several light-hearted and funny moments, making it my favorite of the four.

Lows: While story #2 still approached the common theme in an intriguing and even darker way, I felt the other two remaining segments weren't as interesting or involving. They started becoming less and less cohesive until the very end of story #4, which kind of connects the dots between all of them. Also, there were a few awkward and repetitive occasions that bothered me a little in the last two parts. Finally, the minimal use of music in this film was deafening and caused some annoyance, but nothing severe.

Verdict: A Touch of Sin is an uneven film for me, but it is very ambitious and even brilliant at times. As I stated previously, the first segment really stands out here but none of the others are bad at all, so my overall experience was quite positive.

The title of 'A Touch of Sin', Jia Zhangke's latest commentary on crime and corruption in Chinese society today, appears to have a double meaning. First the 'sins' in the title, refer to either the violent actions of the four protagonists Zhangke has culled from the headlines in modern day China today, or the ruling forces that led them to commit such violent acts. The word 'touch', of course is meant to be wholly ironic; as the violent acts themselves are way more than just a 'touch', and the level of violence (as Zhangke suggests) permeates the entire society. 

But the title also refers to the 1971 Chinese epic action film, 'A Touch of Zen'. The 'Zen' narrative is written in the style of a Wuxia story, which roughly translates as 'Martial Hero'. Wuxia heroes often came from the lower social classes in ancient China and were bound by a code of chivalry that required them, according to Wikipedia, "to right wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove an oppressor, redress wrongs and bring retribution for past misdeeds."

The first of the four stories in 'A Touch of Sin', focuses on Dahai, a coal mining company employee, who is the former classmate of the corporate boss in a provincial town. Dahai, like a Wuxia hero, seeks to right wrongs and fight for righteousness, but ends up becoming unhinged, after confronting the boss, as he arrives at the local airport in his private jet. Dahai's main complaint is that the boss reneged on his offer of profit sharing to his employees. After suffering a humiliating public beat down by the boss' thugs and an attempt to buy him off after he's hospitalized, Dahai goes on a rampage and murders the boss' underlings as well as the boss himself.

The second and least successful of the stories involves a migrant worker, Zhou San, who dispatches three youths who try to rob him while he rides his motorcycle, at the beginning of the film. Zhou turns up at his mother's 70th birthday party but tells his wife that he can't remain at home. We later find out why: Zhou earns his money by shooting strangers on a crowded street and stealing their handbags.

Perhaps the most developed of the four stories, is the third one. Xiao Yu (Zhangke's wife in real life) is a receptionist at a sauna. Her married lover wants her to move to the town where he works, but she refuses, since he's still married. Xiao gets beaten up upon orders of the man's wife but later faces even more danger. A corrupt government official who we earlier see attempt to shake down a transportation worker on a public highway, attempts to sexually assault Xiao at the sauna. She uses a knife (which she took at the train station from her married lover, after he wasn't allowed to carry it on to the train), and stabs the government official multiple times, preventing him from raping her.

Finally, there's the story of Xiao Hui, a young man, who breaks company rules by chatting with a co-worker while work is going on. The co- worker is injured and Xiao Hui is ordered to work, with all his earnings given to the injured co-worker, for the time he's out on sick leave. Xiao Hui flees to another city where he takes a job as a greeter at a high-end sex club, The Golden Age. He befriends a girl there but their relationship fizzles after he realizes she can't escape her job as a 'comfort woman'. Xiao ends up at the grim 'Oasis of Prosperity', a housing complex for workers who toil endless hours on an assembly line. When the co-worker who was injured earlier tracks Xiao down and demands payment of his money, Xiao ends up jumping off the roof.

As a film, 'A touch of Sin', has a schizoid quality. On one hand, Zhangke's does a commendable job of exposing the ills of contemporary Chinese society. The disparity between rich and poor is illustrated in the first story, where promises of worker compensation are never met. The image of the local population, forced to come out to welcome the corporate boss at the airport, as he arrives on his private jet, sticks in one's memory. In the second story, the heinous nature of crimes committed by cold-blooded criminals who escape the bar of justice, is highlighted in high relief. In the third story, the plight of women who are exploited by sexually abusive men, who occupy positions of power, is revealed. And finally, the dehumanization of people in general, through assembly line work, leads one young man in particular, to take his own life.

Despite exposing the ills of modern day China, Zhangke, perhaps owing to his love for the martial arts action epic, appears to revel in the violence he purportedly so detests. Particularly in the first two episodes (and even in the third), the violence seems to appear on screen, for its own sake. There's a great deal of blood-letting but never any consequences (no one ever seems to react when someone is killed). There's more of a story in the third episode, but even there, the stabbing by the victimized sauna worker, has more of a vengeful than defensive tone.

The performances and the cinematography are persuasive. Nonetheless, the pacing is quite languid and there's a lack of solid character development. Yes, Zhangke has managed to illustrate a number of stories culled from contemporary headlines, detailing the basic facts about each characterbut unfortunately, the overall narrative called for more (and certainly with a little less sensationalism). As of this date, it's my understanding that 'A Touch of Sin' has not been shown in China, due to censorship. Hopefully, that situation will change, since the film also offers some correctives for those who maintain an iron grip on millions, who toil, with little hope for economic and political freedom.

In Jia Zhang-ke's A Touch of Sin four individuals revolt against their oppressive lives in contemporary China. It's one of those films whose backdrop is so rarely seen and fascinating we're tempted to ignore the narrative for it. But the stories are too strong to miss.

In a small northern town a loner in a green coat campaigns against the local politicos who have grown obscenely rich by skimming off the money from their sale of the collectively owned mine. The two main symbols are the Mao statue in the town square, all but ignored now, and the Maserati the boss bought and leaves outside his factory. The hero snaps and guns down everyone in his way to the boss, whom he kills at the Buddhist temple.

The second hero returns home on his motorcycle in a Chicago Bulls cap, to find the region scarred by high rises and the Three Gorges hydroelectric plant. The scenes seem like the usual awkward homecoming, till we learn he's just killed three men.

In the fourth story a young man leaves his factory job when he's expected to give his salary to a co-worker who badly injured his hand in a work accident. The boy works as a waiter in a high-priced brothel, where he's attracted to a young whore who reveals she's working to provide for her little daughter. Seeing no escape from the web of poverty and corruption the lad kills himself. 

In the third story a sauna receptionist has broken off with her married lover. When a wealthy man flogs her with his bankroll to bully her into sex she kills him and wanders off bloodied and distracted. She returns in an epilogue, rehabilitated, applying for a job in different part of the country. When she watches a street theatre company the lead peers out at the audience and asks: "Do you know your sin?" But the camera holds on the audience, everyday faces, not the ones whose stories we have stumbled into. The implication is that while we have watched characters driven by ideals and desperation into sin perhaps there is a heavier sin among those prosaic citizens who have quietly put up with everything. If our four heroes have committed "a touch of sin," the collective sins of omission weigh heavier still. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.

I found this to be Jia's strongest film to date. The four short films that make up this movie are very much related in that they are based on real events, which makes the unfolding scenes seem surreal, but at the same time evoking great pathos for the protagonists.

Going in there are some things to keep in mind. The title and events pay a bit of homage to A Touch of Zen, an older wuxia films, which also featured Buddhism as a key theme. In a Touch of Sin, any kind of faith in anyone just falls apart. There is no love, no happiness, and no success. Dreams are not achieved and even when the protagonists achieve their goals of revenge or justice, they are left bitter and empty. 

By using real events Jia is sending out a not so subtle message about how many people in China have lost themselves to greed, have suffered and worked hard to no avail. Living standards do not increase due to corruption, one character has lost his connection with his own family, a mistress begs a man to leave his wife, to be beaten up herself while it is implied that the husband is unscathed, and yet another will do anything to feed her child, including selling her body.

Anyone who has been to China for long periods of time will have seen these events, or something similar, over and over again and it is the ending of the film that drives this message home. You have only yourself to blame repeated while the camera focuses on a group of blank faces, watching and enjoying a show. Jia is talking to all Chinese who just observe, and he seems passionate here to drive the message home, that they are to blame for how their lives have become. And they need to act if they want things to change.

Chinese film-maker Jia Zhang-ke's new film 'A Touch of Sin' is made up of four stories loosely connected to each other. <!--more-->Zhou San (Wang Baoqiang) introduces us to the first of the four characters, a quiet man who seems to have a lot to hide. As with the other characters, Zhou San works away from home and thus separated from his family and home. Dahai (Jiang Wu) tells another story, a coal miner who won't stop pestering everyone about how his boss sold off the mine and got rich while never distributing the wealth to the village. One too many outbursts leads to a chain of events which ends badly.

The third story sees Hubei (Zhao Tao) working in a massage parlour as a receptionist, who is having an affair with a married man. Having waited so long for him to make up his mind, Hubei gives him 6 months to leave his wife. Troubles with work and her private life soon catch up with Hubei, as it does with the final character Xiao Hui (Luo Lanshan). The youngest of the four characters, Xiao Hui drifts from job to job, seemingly in a permanent state of flux. He left his last job through an act of cowardice, involving a work-related accident with a colleague. Permanently broke and unable to find his feet anywhere, Hubei finds the struggle of keeping a job and sending money to his mother difficult to fathom.

'A Touch of Sin' exposes the four individuals struggles in modern China, revealing a growing discontent between the exploited working classes and the ruling elite which forces them to take measures into their own hands. Animals are metaphors for these people who are transported from place to place, who have no apparent control over their location or destiny. These lost souls are defined by a stark landscape of degradation, greed and corruption. There's nowhere to hide, each cannot continue with the life they've led, being controlled by others who gain everything and return very little. Each has to make a decision whether to become part of the system which will benefit themselves but lose all sense of morality and ethics, to avenge their ills, or to curl up and die.

'A Touch of Sin' starts off well, Dahai's story is one which will probably interest you the most. But the film is too long, and suffers from a second half which doesn't quite match the tension and drama of the first half. Its a bleak and unforgiving film, such is the pessimism in Zhang- Ke's dehumanised China that there is simply nowhere to run. In one scene, one characters asks another if he ever feels like travelling abroad. "Why would I?" he replies. "Everywhere is broke. Foreigners come here now." Welcome to the new China.

According to IMDb, this film is included in "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" by Steven Schneider. I, on the other hand, do NOT suggest you see the film as it's thoroughly depressing, nasty and awful! I need to perhaps write a book entitled "1001 god-awful films you must avoid at all costs" and include the movie in this!!

The film is made up of several different stories that are linked, tenuously, together. The stories are all set in modern China and the film was jam packed full of graphic murders, attempted rape, suicide, robbery and the like. A few of the killings seem justified but many are just senseless and very bloody. Other than perhaps being a morality tale about how thoroughly corrupt and soulless modern China is, I really saw no purpose to the film. In fact, I found it all very repellent and awful from start to finish. A truly awful film that I never hope to see again.

Since I viewed 'The World' and 'Still Life' from director Jia ZK a few years back, I have become a fan of this 6th generation film director from China. In this film he explored the ugly side of China, amid its prosperity (at least for some), GDP growth and blatant capitalism. It is about the contrast between the average person trying to make a decent living, and the corrupt officials and bandits that got rich quick. The film contains 4 stories, loosely linked together. Corruption, prostitution, social injustice, stressful lives of migrant workers in the World's Factories in the southern part of the country are all the issues explored and exposed here. Gosh, I am glad this film was allowed to be made by the Chinese government. I bet Jia's international fame has something to do with it.

All in all, I enjoyed the film greatly. I once worked and lived in China for a number of years so the stories relate to me quite easily. For now, I hope Jia can continue to do his work, with the freedom and liberty that he has so far enjoyed. I look forward to more of his work.

Do not focus on the rate. The film is worth watching even if it could have been much better and some of the details in the scenario are clearly a fail beginning with the lack of coherence of the characters. In clear, it's hard to follow them and to understand them. A Touch of Sin turns out to be a hell of a lot of sins, of violence, of crimes and of desperation. During the film I hesitated between skepticism, bewilders or admiration for this rough and tough portrait of China through different stories that are not necessarily linked together. A touch of sin is about four characters in four different regions in China who are going through hard times, because of globalization, corruption or a closed system. All these things will lead them to crime, suicide and the metaphor of the collapse of the system. It is always better to make a critic out of a movie you have fancied but not all of it is to throw away, and I would recommend to watch that movie for its originality and the ambitious scenario of the director. In short it was a great project and maybe some mistakes could have been avoided, but in the end it's indeed an interesting director to follow in the upcoming years.

I found this Chinese film, like many other foreign language pictures in recent years, in the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I hoped it would be another worthy entry. Basically set in present day modern China, apparently based on real events from the recent past, the film revolves around four characters from vastly different geographical locations of the country, and of different social backgrounds and surroundings. The stories, ranging from the busy southern metropolis of Guangzho and Donggaun to the more rural areas of towns such as Shanxi, see each character committing a random act of violence, and the individual stories focus on their often bizarre reasoning behind them, and whether they can get away with it, or face the consequences. Dahai (Wu Jiang) is an angry miner, enraged by widespread corruption in his village, he decides to take justice into his own hands. Zhou San (Baoqiang Wang) is a rootless migrant who discovers the infinite possibilities of owning a firearm, and it seems that anybody could be his next target. Xiao Yu (Tao Zhao) is a young receptionist who dates a married man man and works at a local sauna, but she is pushed beyond her limits by an abusive client, so goes out of her way to make them pay. Xiao Hui (Lanshan Luo) is a young factory worker who goes from one disheartening job to another, and he only faces increasingly degrading circumstances, it is unclear what truly leads him to off the edge. The four overlapping stories of characters going to extremes for different, mostly minor or bizarre reasons, are all interesting, their violent turns are the most memorable moments, and to see how they get on following their kills or whatever, there's a good amount of bloody stuff, it also works as a satirical look at how economic transformation changes people, a great drama. Very good!

I appreciate Jia's movie and would like to offer my perspectives to other (possible) viewers.

I am not really good in talking or writing fancy words, in order to make a review I resolve to analogy between society-cinema and building- section.

Sometime when you try display a building (3d), the best way you can do it on paper(2d), is to show section(s) of the structure with the most prominent feature(s). 

If Chinese modern society is a complex structure, Jia's movies are the most authentic sections you can find.

Always worth your time to watch them. 

My favorite fragment was the "tigercloth" wrapped around the gun, reminding me of the guillotine of tiger head from "Bao Gong stories", it was used to slay corrupt officials... and the blood stain becomes Bao Gong's birth mark.

The director has so much to express, which makes the film loose. He wants to show the whole picture of modern China by referencing lots of news in the stories. But it weakens the story itself. The fourth fragment is most representative. It seems not so reasonable.

A few actors are great, like Wu and Tao, while others do not their roles. Baoqiang is not ferocious enough as a professional robber. Some guest actors are unnecessary, even ruin this movie, such as Sanming.

Anyway, we should show respects to both Zhangke and this movie. He really wants to express his anxiety about this sick society. He reminds us this situation is unstable and unsustainable. We are on the edge of a crash.

"It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates," wrote Hawthorne, yet darkness wins many battles in four murderous portraits from contemporary China that actually happened. A bold and elusive thief traveling along the margins of society, a gentle and lonely heart worn down by itinerant and mechanical work, a fervent revolutionary upset with corruption and greed, and a solitary soul who longs for a family and yet is surrounded by lust, all find themselves separated from society and the love and fulfillment they strive for. Each lashes out violently at their constraints. Filled with intriguing allusions, impressive depth, compelling themes and fantastic stories, I loved how this film seamlessly wound its way through modern China as well as the human heart. Winner of the best screenplay at Cannes.

One additional star for the topic that few has tried to film.

In about ten or twenty years, these 120 minutes of social depicting will be one of the very rare and precious visual stories for people to understand and entertain what is going on in the first ten years of the 21st century China. It offers a prospective with some interesting details that makes sense to the westerners or maybe its fellow countrymen in the future. But it doesn't really add up for the people living in China nowadays, or at least, the details are not enough.

Stories are too short that they can barely touch the real psychology that the Chinese laborers are having today. I'm not sure whether it is something that the director fails to do or he is not allowed to do. For example, there are lots of complexities existing between a complaining Shanxi miner and a mad murderer. Throughout the first story, the only real attempt Dahai, who has learned the laws and has close relatives living in the city, has made to disclose the corruption is a mail letter without a specific address. This is far away from the countless efforts that a Chinese miner would make before he explode himself with the illegal riches. To me, the efforts, the struggles, and the final desperate in Dahai's mind are the most interesting parts of the story. However, nothing really happens in the movie. The result is that, Dahai seems more like a legendary cowboy coming from a classic American western movie than a struggling Chinese worker who has relatives to care about.

It touches the social issues we are all witnessing in China today, it is entertaining and somewhat heroic, but it fails to restore the story into reality, let alone into a provoking level.

The IMDb description irritates me immensely. This is not about random acts of violence, though perhaps they might be the sort of acts characterised as such by any deliberately superficial media outlet. Each of four acts of violence demonstrates one character's breaking point. One shows a personal response to social injustice and corruption; another, a reaction to the stultifying culture and impossibility of a socially acceptable alternative; the third, an outburst against gender hierarchy, oppression and humiliation; finally, an escape from the intransigent work culture. This paints quite a well-rounded picture of much of what appears to be broken in China. It is shot with elegance and edited gracefully. The dialogue rings true and the mis-en- scene is extremely evocative. My only qualm is that the violence presents itself as realistic but in fact is not. When someone is cut deeply or shot in the belly, they scream; they do not fall silently and become inanimate. That's probably a concession to censors but, I feel, is a cop-out.

A lone gunman, fighting for justice in a world full of corruption, intent upon killing the main culprit and not backing down until he has done so. It sounds like something out of a John Ford western, but in fact it's the first of four stories in 'A Touch Of Sin'. This Chinese movie borrows quite a few themes from the classic westerns. Male dominance, for example, and a society lacking morality, but above all: violence as the ultimate solution. 

For a Chinese film maker, this is a brave movie. It paints a very bleak picture of Chinese society, by tackling issues like corruption, crime, prostitution and the exploitation of workers in enormous factories. These are very sensitive issues in modern day China, but still this movie got the green light from the authorities and wasn't banned from Chinese cinemas. 

But not every brave movie is a good one. The problem with 'A Touch Of Sin' is that it consists of four independent stories which differ a good deal in quality. The first one, with the lone gunman, is the best because it is a clear, focused story. Others are sometimes difficult to understand because they are too expansive and too long. 

The common feature in each of the four stories is the violence. Director Zhangke Jia shows it in a very graphic way, reminiscent of crime movies from Hong Kong or Japan. The bullet holes and blood splattering seem a bit out of place in a film appealing to an art-house audience, but at the same time it gives this movie a nice nihilistic touch.

A Touch of Sin by Chinese director Jia Zhang-Ke tells 4 independent stories that culminate in some act of violence in modern China. It feels that the movie's intention is to portrait the reality of a generation that feels confused and out of place on a new reality that clashes modern capitalism with former communism. We understand that, however its hard to accept this is successfully achieved on the movie. Those elements are introduced yes, but... they feel like an excuse for what will predictably come next. The movie is greatly directed: that is its main strength and its worth watching for that, but the structure of 4 independent stories doesn't allow an emotional connection with the viewer, and the violence ends up being predictable and sometimes silly. This would have worked well as 4 separated short movies independently. That would have been powerful. Unfortunately, the theme that connects them is not sufficient to justify the movie as a whole, which is odd since this was the winner for best screenplay on Cannes. This asked for more depth and a more cohesive plot. At the end, the social meaning isn't but a cloud hanging over 4 good short stories that are technically wonderful but fail to go beyond its intentions of being a relevant portrait of China's modern society.

I saw this film at the Ghent (Belgium) film festival 2013, where it was selected as part of the official Competition. Technically there was nothing wrong with it: shot beautifully, and acted splendidly. However, I could derive no underlying theme other than the under-achievers who were the respective main characters in the four loosely connected stories. Was there otherwise something in common, apart from the fact that all four stories ended in unmitigated violence?? The only shooting that was justified, occurred in the beginning of the story where one motor cyclist was threatened by three men armed with axes, but it was just an isolated incident without a preceding story to explain. All other shooters whose history we followed later on, may have considered themselves above the law, justified in killing around for a just cause. But I did not get their ulterior motives, at least not as being strong enough to arrive at what they did.

The festival website mentioned "underclass rage" as binding theme, but that is not sufficient for me. The stories in itself are well told and technically flawless, but one keeps wondering all the time what's the point in this bloodshed. It may be considered social commentary, but it lacks constructive ideas or novel insights. On the positive side, we from outside China get a fresh view on life in China as it is nowadays, giving us the chance to see that it does not look much different when looking from the outside. The landscapes and the cities could have been European or American, if we disregard the obvious fact that all the people there look Chinese. But I don't think a guided tour was the ultimate purpose of the film makers.

Speaking of Chinese looks: It was a nice touch that we were allowed to recognize the respective main characters throughout "their" story, this usually being rather difficult for us Europeans, having great problems telling Chinese (and Japanese, for that matter) apart; "they all look alike" is a common statement. In this movie we always had a particular distinguishing mark to assist us in following the main character. I'm not sure it was a deliberate setup by the film makers, to facilitate international distribution, but anyway it helped very much.

All in all, this film falls short in delivering the obviously intended message that some people cannot stand being ignored or neglected for too long a time, and thus are bound to eventually "explode" in some way. Another thing that also did not work out, was involving me in the main characters, who seemed to me coming from a different planet and acting illogically. On the other hand, we got a nice view on contemporary China, far away from the touristic sightseeing routes, a seldom chance that we otherwise don't get easily. Very well acted and shot as well. All things considered, I scored a 3 (average) for the audience award when leaving the theater. This film ranked 39th for the audience award, score 3.73 out of 5. And the international jury awarded it for "its musical choice and the combination of traditional and contemporary music".

ADDENDUM as of December 2013: I saw this movie twice by accident, while it was programmed as part of the Tiger Friends Preview Event prior to the 2014 International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR). Which movie would be screened during this event, was kept secret until the last minute. When it became clear what was about to happen, I did not run away however. It happened to me before that a repeated viewing worked very well to grasp things missed the first time. But alas, in this case it merely amplified my former conclusions. The only change in appreciation was that I liked the first story better than previously. On the other hand, knowing beforehand what was going to happen, the other three stories exposed more inconsistencies than I was aware of the first time. Anyway, the whole experience was not boring, and it still offers a nice view on contemporary China, but that is all there is.

Four independent stories failing to involve, and failing as social commentary too. Serves very well as guided tour through contemporary China

Nobody can deny that like all economic systems, "Capitalism" too is condemned time and again by filmmakers. What is important to note is that "A Touch of Sin" is the first serious attempt by a Chinese director to berate capitalism which is causing irreparable damages to Chinese nation especially to its ordinary population which is unable to figure out how to deal with money and its implications on a person's life. In all frankness, calling "A Touch of Sin" a feature-film would be a travesty of cinema as it is merely a well stitched collection of four different short films about ordinary people in China who have succumbed to pressures. Although it has been highly praised by media all over the world,this new film by Chinese director Jia Zhangke is utterly predictable and does not offer anything new. One wonders on what grounds was it selected for best screenplay prize at Cannes Film Festival 2013 ? When one leaves an independent form of filmmaking for more commercial style of filmmaking, weaknesses in the film are clearly evident. For example-There is an exaggerated scene involving a business man with a wad of currency notes who continually pummels a woman to prove his point that capitalism has not left any scope for human feelings.This scene could have used less violence but Jia Zhangke chose to dramatize it to such an extent that it became almost unbearable to watch.Lastly,this film is replete with numerous scenes of this type where "too much" is done in the name of sophistication at a time when "too little" could also have easily eased things for the film,the director and the viewers.
