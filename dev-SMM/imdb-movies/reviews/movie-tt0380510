### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I just saw The Lovely Bones today & having let it set in I thought it was a tremendous film!!! OK, I'll admit that Peter Jackson tried a little too much to overpower the film with CGI but that does not take anything away from the heart & emotion this film can generate. 

Firstly the acting is absolutely superb with fine performances all round. Saoirse Ronan (from my homeland - Ireland) is a revelation as Susie Salmon. I have yet to see such a gifted piece of acting from such a young actress since Natalie Portman in Léon. She has been robbed of a nomination for a truly Oscar-worthy performance. Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon & of course Stanley Tucci (one of the finest supporting actors in modern times) are all convincing here too. 

I believe that when the nay-sayers saw the level of CGI they lost interest & forgot what this film can really offer you at its core - tension, heartbreak, thrills & joy.

If you really make the effort to delve into this film, you will come out with a tear in your eye. If not, then I pity you for not being able to look past the CGI blunders & see a really emotional film.

-The following will not reveal any spoilers above those presented in any trailer-

It is rather sad, to see how people are grabbing on to many of the former reviews and are continually bashing on the CGI use in this, in my opinion, hauntingly beautiful movie. 

If one would actually watch this movie without reading any reviews at all, without having an opinion about a movie they are about to watch before even having seen it for themselves and just take it for what is presented, I strongly believe there would be much more positive opinions about it. 

And to mention this before anything else is said: I do not believe that the movie is too CGI crowded since the scenes at hand are meant to be unearthly and even a little mystical at that! I am not a very emotional person, I haven't even been able to really feel sad when others around me were already sobbing. But going into this movie and just letting it do its magic, it actually touched me deeply and made me think about it! 

Sure - there are a few things that might have been done differently, probably even quite a bit better. But the all-in-all feel this movie leaves the viewer with is incredible. The bizarre but at the same time beautiful world of the in-between, the pain of the family members over the horrible loss and their unique ways of, not necessarily dealing, but rather living with it, even the sick mind behind the murder - it all works together in creating that viewing experience that is deeply touching through its countless layers.

The acting of pretty much each individual actor is already quite impressive, but as the characters interact, one can actually feel the emotional bonds and understandings, as well as the tension or even hatred between them. 

All in all I can only urge anyone who loves movies that go beyond that typical mirror of merely entertaining and uninspired filmmaking to watch this gem. Certainly not everyone will enjoy or appreciate it as much as I did, but at least give it the chance it deserves without going into it, already looking for those 'evil CGI' parts and at the very least you will have your own opinion about it afterward and not the one of some guys that merely told you the same thing they only heard from someone else ;)

I hope you have a great viewing experience!

I vaunt myself of being an independent thinker and yet I was taken by the atrocious reviews "The Lovely Bones" got. Rogert Ebert called it "deplorable" I didn't go to see it when it first came out. Shame on me! The risks Peter Jackson took, a thoroughly established filmmaker, should be applauded. True, it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but then, what is? I was taken by surprise, a film of unbearable emotional suspense breaking every imaginable rule. We're far too used to have stories in which everything is neatly tied up by the end, so we can go back home with a fictitious peace of mind. In "The Lovely Bones" we know who the monster is from the time the monstrosity is committed but we're only spectators unable to do anything about it and that frustration may have turn part of the audience and most of the critics away. True the CGI of the "in between" is, sometimes, too much but the film as a whole is a real experience. Saorise Ronan is marvelous, so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Stanley Tucci was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Susan Sarandon, another risk taker, plays the emotional constipated grandmother with great courage. Look at the exhaustion on her face as she takes care of the family, drained without betraying the arid nature of the character. As the film ended I stayed in silence for the longest time, embedded in the sadness, clinging to the hope and mystified by the massacre the critics perpetrated in this original and highly recommendable film

This movie shouldn't be my cup of tea. I'm pretty cynical and my favourite film genres are sci-fi and horror in that order. However, this film blew me away.

I don't understand all of the negative reviews concentrating on the CGI. It's supposed to be depicting an other-worldly realm between earth and heaven - what do you expect / want to see if you go to Heaven, grim city streets with alleys full of garbage and low-lifes? I found the imagery to be exactly what I would hope from heaven - endless possibilities bounded only by imagination - and it delivered that feeling.

As for the plot and the acting, I thought it was first-rate from start to finish.

If you still have a soul in this cynical world then I'm sure you'll like it - don't listen to the miserable horde.

I'd like to preface my review with a comment about the negativity circulating around here about this movie. I don't think it's any coincidence that some of these self-appointed "film-making experts" who have nothing remotely positive to say about Jackson's effort cannot formulate complete sentences. It's not surprising at all that someone obsessed with the wetness of a prop in one scene and its dryness in the next lacks the faculty and capacity to appreciate the many merits of this film. It's ridiculous to knit-pick on 'unrealistic' depictions of this aspect of day to day life or that aspect. If you want a realistic depiction of day to day life, observe the world around you, not a movie screen.

The Lovely Bones is being unfairly hammered as maudlin drivel. Some of the concepts and visuals are on the representational side, but if you take this film as a strange amalgam of a murder/suspense thriller and a fantasy in the vein of a children's book, it all works perfectly. The emotional outpouring is portrayed very well by all the players involved. None of it seemed forced. I became emotionally invested early on and the overall impact of this work struck a chord in me that resonated deeply.

More than anything else, this film is unique. Jackson takes many chances when one considers all the traditionally accepted conventions of film making, but unless you are one of those self-absorbed, self-important film student types who endlessly struggle with the "rules of making good films," you'll get something out of this.

The use of CGI was adventurous to be sure, but if one views this piece as an interpretation of life, love, and death through a fantastical lens, then the effects remain harmonious to the telling of the story. More, the CGI in this case describes 'world's unseen,' metaphysical possibilities existing simultaneously without the bounds of physical space and time. A welcome departure from space ships and crumbling cities. Some of the nastiest complaints about the CGI are coming from people who probably have no problem with giant robots that transform into cars and trucks.

Acceptance of a fictional story, the suspension of disbelief, these events occur in the relationship between a movie and its viewer completely apart from all the rules of pacing, subtext, and all the rigid pigeonholes that don't really apply to the creative process anyway. I did not find the Lovely Bones to be maudlin, and I am a pretty jaded movie-viewer.

In navigating the torrent of negativity to which this movie has been subjected, one thing to keep in mind is that it's an adaptation of a very widely read and popular book.

The book itself had a rather sunny disposition, which is ironic as it often was somewhat grislier in detail than the movie. That's because events can be described in words in a grisly way but still be part of an optimistic universe when you are reading -- it works. That doesn't quite happen when you actually see things with your eyes, film is much more literal (strange to say) that literature.

Considering the subject matter, the murder of a young girl, it's a bit unfair to go to the movie and expect to see the book come to life on the screen.

The problem in making the movie, as in any adaptation of magical realism concerning dark subjects, is how to capture the magic without having it jar too much with the realism. That was extremely difficult to do here considering how grim the subject is. So when Jackson uses special effects to invoke heaven, people tend to completely flip out, without really offering their own alternative about how that "should" have been done.

All this adds up to a book that perhaps shouldn't have been adapted for the screen at all. That said, I think the movie is quite a fine one, especially because of the magnificent performances of the two leads, Ronan and Tucci. Thanks to the sweet-faced and deeply affecting Ronan, you'll never forget Susie Salmon. The music is also just fantastic, not surprising as Brian Eno did it -- it's very disappointing that the soundtrack is not available, as it's beautiful and haunting.

I'd suggest seeing it and just let yourself decide if it's a worthwhile experience or not. I found it to be a very good try at adapting a book that by its nature is extremely hard to film. Actually the best way to go at it would be to watch the movie, then read the book, then try to figure out for yourself how you would have done it differently. I suspect that you'll gain a new appreciation for Jackson's movie if you do that.

Based on the thorough thrashing this movie has received from other reviewers, I came with few expectations. Movies based on novels are, after all, often difficult to put together in a way that is satisfying to readers yet visually engaging. On this note I must disagree with the negative reviews and nay-sayers: Jackson has succeeded in both stunning me visually (hard to do, as I'm an artist and therefore picky) and thoroughly tugging my heartstrings. I found myself in tears during easily one third of the movie. Although I am an emotional person, I strongly disagree that The Lovely Bones bears much resemblance to a made-for-TV melodrama.

I gave it a 9/10 because it is not perfect. There are a few elements that could have been better developed, such as the relationship that grows between Susie's younger brother Buckley and their bereaved father. However, Jackson chose to focus almost completely on Susie's dilemma in the afterlife as she watches her family grieve and her killer become maddeningly arrogant in his ability to duck and cover.

It is this reviewer's opinion that if you came to The Lovely Bones expecting a gruesome rape scene along the lines of A Time to Kill, you were disappointed. (Jackson expressed dismay that his viewers would even WANT to witness a 14-year-old girl being raped and murdered, stating that he had no desire to portray such and never will.) This movie will not appeal to males in general, particularly under the age of twenty-five, for what should be obvious reasons. It is about a young girl whose life was stolen from her. She therefore has a young girl's feelings, hopes, and fantasies. If you can't relate to those emotions, then you probably won't like this movie. If you can't be touched by the powerful imagery the CGI in the movie provides, you probably won't like this movie. There are straightforward, A to Z movies that tell their stories step-by-step from beginning to end (plot-driven), and then there are movies that weave a tale around the emotions and struggles of their characters (character-driven). This movie is one of the latter, and if you don't like that kind, then you probably won't enjoy it. Furthermore, a character-driven tale based on a novel in which every character receives as much screen time as it did page time ends up becoming epic in length. I marathon-read the book in one day. How long does a movie based on it need to be in order to accurately establish the core plot?

In summary, if you can allow Jackson's special effects to blow you away, as was intended, and if you can approach it with an open heart, then you're in for a real treat in The Lovely Bones. It was elegantly done and very entertaining -- to the right person.

I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing: a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad life-and-death meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the "in-between", a kind of purgatory, after being raped and murdered, on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or, possibly, a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route, but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.

Maybe it's just a general attitude that Jackson and his writers, wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Bowens, take from the book. What might have been poignant observations, for example, from the girl Suzie Salmon (like the fish) becomes a series of really jagged narration in the film that is a) poorly written, b) in a continuously ineffective and/or annoying tone from Saoirse Ronan (who is not bad in the film, by the way, when the material requires it), and c) it's redundant. We see her sights in this in-between world, moving about and in quick motions without consistency, though as with Avatar one might say at least it's "pretty", and her descriptions are at best unnecessary and at worst just stupid. It's some of the worst use of narration last year (compare it to The Informant! and see how much of a drop-off it is).

But narration is just one thing. Another is a lack of focus in the story, and actually getting to really care about any one of the living characters. It's not really the actors fault, as Wahlberg, Weisz and Imperioli do what they can in their roles (Wahlberg especially, in spite of everything, throws himself into the devastated father well). When it comes time for us to really get into the emotional grit and horror of this situation, of how horrible it really is, it's actually glossed over by Suzie's situation up in the in-between. There isn't a solid 'conflict' about who the killer is since it's revealed in the first few minutes of the film. On top of this the logic on Stanley Tucci's character is all-too obvious - it's a perfectly creepy performance, but a little subtlety might have helped. And then there's the lush grandmother played by Susan Sarandon that is used for very ill-timed and unfunny comic relief midway through the movie, after which she's pushed aside to a reactionary role.

And yet I didn't have as big a problem like some critics have had, which is with the in-between itself and its visual scheme. While it's not as imaginative as Jackson seems to think it is, it does reflect, more or less, what a 14 year old girl's emotional state would be in an afterlife world. It's more-so a problem when Jackson deals with balancing this fantasy afterworld with the real one, and the rules of how Suzie reaches out to those is never firmly established (the one girl she brushes against running down the street is one thing, her parents and sister are another). It's not so much the sights but, again, a mood and attitude that Jackson botches: what is with this Asian girl that accompanies Suzie? It's explained, to be sure, as are the other victims of Tucci's child killer, but the attachment she has with her previous life and family is screwy, it becomes muddled and unsatisfying.

I would almost stop short... no, I would just about claim that this is close to being the kind of cloying, sappy crap that one would usually find its way onto Lifetime, where struggles are put to melodramatic limits, and by the end every plot strand, no matter how unlikely, is resolved (one of those, involving Rachel Weisz's character, is just ridiculous in its timing). And yet for all of the story and character problems, for all the clunky dialog, Jackson has a few moments where he can let his actors have room to breathe. Chief of these are scenes involving suspense, when Suzie is in the lair of the man who will kill her, which is a gradual scene of weird intensity, and then later a scene where Tucci comes into his house while Suzie's sister is snooping around. Little glimmers of the kind of filmmaker one saw from fifteen years ago on another movie about teenage girls and the fragility of life and death and love, Heavenly Creatures, in such real dramatic clarity and power. But that's all really.

The Lovely Bones has so much that could go right with it that it's most disappointing how wrong it goes. It takes someone with as much talent and passion as Jackson to screw up on this level. He and his writers have not made an exactly boring movie, but it could very well be for some in the audience. I found myself shaking my head and frowning at what I saw, a watered down vision of reconciling grief and loss, and at best a mixed-bag of a story surrounding a not-whodunit about a child killer. Some may be moved, and more power to them. I couldn't wait for this wishy-washy journey to end.

A very unconventional movie that crosses many genres (murder/suspense/thriller/drama/fantasy), defies normal expectations and is an intense emotional experience. Right from the outset you are informed of when the lead character will be murdered and who her killer is but you are still kept on the edge of your seat and surprised by later revelations. The story dovetails between reality (before and after the murder) and a surreal afterlife realm in between Heaven and Earth. Despite the tragic, heart-wrenching and dark subject matter, the film is uplifting, captivating and hauntingly beautiful throughout. As the credits rolled, I ran through a gamut of emotion and found aspects of the film resonated with me long after. 

It is difficult to conceive as to why this movie was critically panned. I can only surmise that either the story didn't follow the source material closely (I have not read the book) or viewers didn't appreciate the story being told from the perspective of a 13 year old girl or critics were just being spiteful towards a successful director (Directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Steven Spielberg).

PROS

(a) Original, imaginative, creative story / screenplay. (b) Authentic, well-drawn, endearing characters. (c) Thrilling & entertaining from start to finish. (d) A visual masterpiece - both from a cinematic perspective and a CGI/special effects perspective. Definitely warrants viewing in HD (Blu-Ray). (e) Superlative lead actors: Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci. (f) Solid supporting actors: Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg. (g) Subtle but powerful soundtrack. (h) Thematically rich and filled with symbolism & metaphors.

CONS

(a) Childhood romantic relationships seem forced and only marginally believable. (b) Film appears to be heavily edited due to the long running time. Certain characters, scenes, and threads could have been fleshed out more. (c) The clairvoyant girl (Ruth) was a bit cliché & one-dimension. (d) Adequate resolution of killer's fate but not deeply satisfying.

This was a highly anticipated film on its release . Based upon the cult novel by Alice Sebold and directed by Peter Jackson it opened to very Luke warm reviews by the critics . Normally I don't care what critics say but since I was very short of money I decided to save myself the price of a cinema ticket and catch it for free. In the mean time a lot of time had passed before I caught it tonight and I don't know if the criticisms of the film adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES had prejudiced my own opinion but this is a highly offensive film and we all know why don't we ? 

Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he called this film deplorable . The premise of the film centres around a 14 year old girl called Suzie who is raped and murdered by George Harvey . Jackson does his level best to make the inciting scene of the rape and murder as tense and as frightening as possible without causing offence . The irony is that as soon as Suzie reaches the afterlife any viewer with the vaguest notion of secularism will be very offended to think that a murdered 14 year old child will be enjoying them self in an afterlife beyond all human imagination in its beauty . Put it like this : If this was a film featuring a protagonist fighting Jihad and woke up to the afterlife seen here would you believe there wasn't an agenda behind it ? Of course I'm not for a second stating there is any spiritual/religious/political agenda behind the film but this is the totally confused unintentional message Jackson is giving out 

It's a certainly a beautiful film from a technical viewpoint . Jackson is certainly influenced by the aesthetic beauty of the best Michael Powell movies and the cinematography is worthy of Jack Cardiff at his very best which is complemented by the visual capabilities of 21st century film making . All this is enhanced by the haunting score from Brian Eno . Unfortunately all this belongs in a different film entirely such as a film with an original screenplay featuring perhaps a doomed love affair, perhaps a film where someone remembers someone who they can never have 

In short Peter Jackson is the completely wrong choice for director . A film featuring a victim of child murder should be gloomy and introspective made with a much smaller budget . It certainly wouldn't have had the critical anticipation that Jackson had brought but it certainly wouldn't have had people complaining that the message of this film screams that " Kill them all and let God decide . Dying has never been so much fun "

Oh my! This was a horrible movie. It has been a while since I have seen one this bad. The acting was fine, everyone did a good job on that end, but the cut scenes to the acid trip land of Susie Salmon's "Heaven" were a waste of time. She never did anything there that impacted the story line. At least in "What Dreams May Come" there was a point to it. So here are some highlights of lack of logic and frustration for me:- Watching Mark Wahlberg, who they couldn't hide his frame under the 70's shirts, get beat up by a wimpy high schooler was completely bogus! - The ending with the icicle causing the killer to trip and fall off a cliff was horrible, watching Mark beat the crap out of him and throw him off a cliff would have been much better. - The LSD trip scenes of heaven were just plain boring. If Susie could have actually done anything to help her family that would have been good. - Mark's character welcoming his wife back after however long she had wimped out on her family was pretty bogus. - Mark's daughter holding the book of the killer to see his mom and dad have some fairy tale greeting and not saying, "Look, I found her killer, and he almost got me and may try again...Oh hi mom!" was completely stupid. - Many more...

Good points (I could only come up with one): - I liked them not going into details of the murder, who needs to have their mind filled with junk like that. That was well done to give a somewhat tense scene without having to see the murder or even know if there was a sexual assault.

Although this isn't really a horror for me still it's classified under horror. I can understand that some people will find it gruesome due the subject but I must say that it had no drip of red stuff in it. Not that that is important, just look at Texas Chainsaw or Halloween, they were bloodless too. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this creepy flick. It reminded me a lot of The Loved Ones somehow, it must be the use of slow motion and the score. On the other hand it also reminded me of Heavenly Creatures by the way they used the dream sequences. It's a special flick coming from the hand of Peter Jackson. Knowing him for splatter and gore in his earlier days this could be a let down for some but I really liked it the way it was shot and the use of CGI didn't bother me at all. Not for everyone but if you can stand weird flicks than this won't be a problem for you.

I had heard such wonderful things about the book and decided to read it...I could not put it down. The power of this story and the feeling of what lies in the hereafter and how people cope with death and the grieving process and what lies beyond was overwhelmingly powerful. I was extremely excited to watch the movie...what a disappointment. Truly the worst adaptation of a book that I have seen since they killed Flowers In The Attic. The best parts of the book are manipulated and regenerated so much that you do not even get the true meaning of what truly made this story memorable. Especially the key role that certain characters played that they did not even give the light of day!! What happened to the most important part that Ruth played??? The characters do not even get a chance to grow up for goodness sake!!! The whole point of the story is how the dead and the undead cope after wards! There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie.

TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE!! My advice...read the book and just skip the movie...your own imagination can paint a better picture and you will come out of it with a much better and enlightening experience.

An attractive cast quickly deteriorates in this heavily visual film that forgot its story.

It's no secret that the protagonist is murdered, but the neighbor who commits the crime (it is revealed at the top of the film, no secret there, either) is a cartoon of creepiness. The only traits missing are flop sweat and incontinence. Tucci's character is no picture of normalcy.

Wahlberg and Weisz are wasted in this film. The actresses who portray their daughters do better, but the film fails them. The beautiful boyfriend is so carefully framed, that this should have been a TWILIGHT-type flick so tweens could worship him. And the actress whose folks oversee the sink-hole dump is too pretty to play a socially-disabled teen.

Then the chorus of characters in the "between world" are Stephen King quality spooks, complete with wooden delivery and mysterious statements which when questioned are followed by "you'll see" answers.

Questions about this film: (1) In a field adjacent to the school, why didn't anyone see preparation or demolition of the secret place? (2) Why was Wahlberg miscast in this role of an emotional wreck who is short-fused and obsessed? His celebrity has been built around characters who are cool, circumspect, smarter-than-average, and now they want us to believe he's slightly stupid? (3) When a safe is taken to be dumped into the sink-hole dump, why does he park so far away, and who built an antique floor safe that appears to weigh as much as a filing cabinet? (5) Why is Susan Sarandon in this film? It seems as if her character came from another movie and offers NOTHING to this script. She's overdressed, but can't operate a washing machine? This is failed farce at its worst. (6) Why isn't there ever resolution to this film, which deals in obviousness? Why get obtuse now?

I've read several reviews in which female viewers "cried" and gave high marks. Is that all it takes emotional string-pulling? Film makers know exactly how to lead up to an emotional crescendo, how many "beats" to wait, and when to pull the trigger for tears.

This movie was a piece of sappy garbage. The nauteously overdone CGI heaven sequences bring the movie to a halt every time we are there. Jackson destroyed the few characters (and actors performances for that matter) who had potential to be interesting: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weiz. The movie is a cut and paste job of the book that tries to do too much with too many characters. Jackson switches point of view just enough to never allow us to connect to anyone in the film.

Peter, please go back to action movies. It is the only place where this much CGI can makeup for bad storytelling.

This movie is so poorly done I can't even believe it was allowed to come to theaters to be honest. I read the book and absolutely loved it but while watching I couldn't help but wonder if Peter Jackson had even picked it up. Hardly any of the actors fit the characters roles and most of them didn't even try, it was like watching a huge disaster on the big screen. Peter cut out everything important to make it a PG-13 movie when it clearly must be R to really get its point across and be done correctly. He removed the affair between the mother and the detective, the son wasn't even in it from the middle to the end, and nothing was explained at all. You had to have read the book to even get what he was hinting at and even then you were confused. Jackson just tried to pretty it up with special effects and while they were well done they didn't have any point and in the end looked rather ridiculous. All in all it was a movie with huge names and a decent budget that was just a piece of garbage that should have been put in the right hands. I hope in a few years someone with a real artistic eye and the ability to take such a great book with amazing potential comes long and takes hold of this gem and makes something worth watching out of it. Stick to action movies Peter, for the love of God!

(Possible spoilers follow) 

The easiest way to sum the film up is by saying "WTF?" I have not read the book, though to be honest after seeing the movie I really don't want to. Its mostly not a bad movie, but I have yet to figure out what the point of it all is, and as for the ending-let's not go there.

This is the story of a young girl who is murdered and who hangs in a transitional world where everything is ducky watching over her family and the man who killed her. She watches how in the wake of her murder her family breaks apart and comes together and her killer continues his day to day activity, safe knowing that people have mostly stopped looking for him.

Other than the imagery, which is spectacular, and the details, which aren't much of anything, you now know as much about the movie as I do even after I've finished watching it. I kind of see the point of how life goes on in the wake of tragedy and how bad people sometimes get away with things (more about the ending later) and how we aren't really gone after we go, but by the time I got to the end, waiting, oh Lord was I waiting, for something to happen, I was kind of shocked when nothing did. Yes there are all sorts of things going on between the characters in the family, but as for grand revelations there was nothing. I would have loved even no message but a catharsis at the end concerning the killer, but nope there is only one of the silliest moments I've seen in a long time and it produced loads of laughter from those seeing the film in a completely "You must me joking" sort of way.

I don't get it. And I spent over two hours of my time watching this because....? What were you trying to tell me? Yes I know you made some incredible images with what is found in the place on the other side of life, as for the rest of it I don't see the point.

I'm a huge Peter Jackson fan. I know sometimes he hits (say Heavenly Creatures, Forgotten Silver and Lord of the Rings) and I know sometimes he misses (King Kong, Dead Alive), but even when he fails the films seem to have a point, and a sense of purpose. This time out I don't think he knows what he was trying to say.

A major misfire and probably my least favorite Jackson film.

Peter Jackson did a HORRIBLE job with this movie. Just like all other book-to-movie adaptations, it was a TRAIN WRECK. There are several missing and/or out-of-order events that were crucial to the story, as well as some discrepancies from the book.

1. In the book, the mother leaves AFTER the dad gets the living daylights beat out of him in the cornfield, NOT before.

2. In the book, Ray and Ruth are Susie's same age, not older. 

3. In the book, the mother and Detective Fenerman have an affair. THIS IS CRUCIAL to the rest of the story as it not only happens while Dad is in the hospital recovering from the cornfield incident, but it causes her to leave! 

4. There is just way too much that happens in the book after the murder that is actually IMPORTANT to the story, and sadly left out.

5. In the book, Mom returns only when Dad is in the hospital after suffering a heart attack, and the children are MUCH older. Also, she and Lindsey do not automatically make nice with each other, the same holding true for her and her husband. 

6. Nothing is done to show the developing relationship between Dad and Buckley in the time that has passed since the murder as it is in the book. The poor little boy just kind of...disappears. In fact, nothing is really done to show the progression of time at all. 

7. As with Buckley, the stories of Ruth and Ray just kind of...disappear. 

8. Where is Mrs. Singh? She is a critical character as Mom befriends her at some point in the book! 

9. In the book, Mr. Harvey dumps the safe with Susie's body into the sinkhole RIGHT after the murder, NOT at the end when he is preparing to run away. 

10. In the book, when Susie comes back to Earth near the end, her soul possesses Ruth's body and Ruth's soul goes up to heaven, where she is considered a hero. Susie in her entirety does not fall back down to Earth. Ray kisses Ruth's lips but it is Susie's soul who occupies the body.

11. In the book, Dad tells Lindsey to break into Mr. Harvey's house. She doesn't do it of her own accord.

12. In the book, Dad doesn't root through lists of serial killers, etc., to suggest Detective Fenerman to look through. His initial instinct is Mr. Harvey. Also, in the book, Ray is thoroughly investigated by the police as a suspect.

Peter Jackson seems to have, yet again, gone special-effects crazy and not too focused on a plot. Alice Sebold herself should have directed the movie, at least we would have seen some sort of visible plot.

Also, my recommendation to anyone wanting to watch a movie adaptation of a book - just read the book. Don't waste your time on the movie.

And my recommendation to directors who want to make a movie adaptation of a book - don't waste your time either. It seems that every movie adaptation of a book is brutally butchered, then left hanging in the Inbetween, just as Susie Salmon is in in The Lovely Bones.

Pretty to look at, beautiful at times even, but with all his distractions Jackson has somehow managed to take brutal and disturbing subject matter and leave me feeling nothing apart from vague amusement and disbelief that he actually went there.

I haven't read the book, and even I could tell he completely missed the point. This story, which seems like it should be about the slow disintegration of a family following an unimaginable tragedy, has been turned into a campy whodunnit where you know who dun it from the start.

Rather than concentrate on the relationships between the characters, he fails to connect the dots, jumping perspectives often enough to break any of those connections. It comes across as a set of disjointed episodes with overdone cgi in between rather than a coherent story. The jumps are so jarring at times (Oh look, mom is moving out. Oh look, she's come back again) I have to wonder if some of this is down to the editing and there was far more here in earlier cuts.

There's one particularly tone-deaf sequence where the grandmother (Susan Sarandon, clearly enjoying herself) swoops in and tries to "cheer everyone up". Fair enough there are people who would do that in this sort of situation, but it is so so overdone - overflowing the washer, setting the kitchen ablaze, all to a bouncy rock soundtrack - that I couldn't help thinking of Mrs Doubtfire. Completely off-color for something like this. I was struggling already but kind of gave up at this point, even if I did want to see how far he would go - and the ending is a doozy! After the luminous first half-hour, where I thought there was potential for a serious shattered innocence angle, it's a long sequence of "wait... really?" moments.

The actors try hard, including Wahlberg who I have trouble taking seriously after "The Happening", and I'm pretty sure THEY understood the real story here, but Jackson gives them very little to work with. Actors often say they don't like to watch their own work, because it's almost always disappointing to see a different story than the one you thought you were telling, and they would be well-advised to stay away from this one because Jackson not only changes the story - he barely tells a story at all.

Surely not for teenagers and younger, since the whole killer scenes are quite disturbing. 

Is it a thriller? The Disney like fluffy after death scenes speak against it, when teenagers in plateau shoes dance on records. 

Is it a whodunnit? Not really since you see the killer early (why they hide him in the first 2 minutes is beyond me). And how they ever even suspect the guy near the end is very beyond me, too. It is completely out of the blue and for no reason. 

So did they try to make a movie that was never seen before? Well, some scenes were way too cliché for that. 

Does the development of characters or story suck you in? Well, again I have to respectfully negate this question. No character seems to develop, at least not in a reasonable way. Why does the father suddenly suspect the guy, why is he ready to let go, why does the mother come back suddenly? 

Is it a movie about love? Maybe just maybe, the beyond abysmal kissing scene near the end when the dead girl seems to take over the weird girl could be a hint, but quite frankly, it better not!

Tell us, for whom was this movie done? I have no clue and the director did not care either. And this is the big problem of the movie. It is a big pool of nothingness. And boring on top.

I hold no reservations in saying "The Lovely Bones" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen...But, I hate it when people say stuff like that and don't provide at least some indication as to how they've reached that conclusion...So, here were go: 

The acting was bad. In a movie like this, the acting should have been moving. It wasn't. I really didn't feel like these characters were going through much of anything at all. That shouldn't have been the case. Mark Wahlberg, in particular, needs some help here. I think he needs to take an acting class or otherwise go back to playing the beat 'em up, shoot 'em up mindless action hero he seems to like to play.

Too much CGI. A little bit of CGI goes a long way. It's like a piece of cheesecake. If you get too much of it, you're going to get a stomachache. That's exactly how I felt during this movie. I just felt like the CGI disconnected the characters from each other. I didn't feel much interaction between certain characters at all, namely because of the fact they weren't interacting. You'd have some actors filming a scene in the "real world" and then the main character, Susie Salmon, in some purgatory-esque CGI land...Ugh! 

There was no flow between scenes. I had this same complaint about "Twilight", another book-to-movie adaptation whose screenplay wasn't written by the original author -- not that it would've mattered in either case since I don't think the source material was good in itself. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie but rather just a collection of individual scenes stuck together. It just felt all cheaply spliced together.

The ending was just unforgivable...You've got a guy whose been going around killing young girls and he is never found out for his crimes. He's never tried in court, never convicted, never sentenced to death or at least life in prison...Instead, an icicle takes him out and he falls backwards over a cliff like something out of a damn Wiley E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon.

Whoever chose the music for this movie was an idiot, too. The fact that a song came out in the 70s and the story takes place in the 70s doesn't mean they automatically go together. The songs used just didn't fit the mood of the movie. Horribly bad soundtrack choices. There are plenty of 70s songs that would've been better than the ones they chose. Horrible! In closing, this movie was a mess. 

I can't believe the same guy who directed "Lord of the Rings" directed it. Even more shocking, or maybe not so shocking based off his work in recent years, is the fact Steven Spielberg was an executive producer of this turd.

Avoid this movie at all costs!

The cutting-edge (for the time) CGI completely overpowers this movie, because the plot is so feeble. You may manage to stay with it in order to see the murderer get his comeuppance, but not because you care about any of the characters. I actually laughed at the scenes with the mother running off to work in an orchard - she did about ten seconds' work, then sat around reading letters while the other fruitpickers slaved away.

Mark Wahlberg does a pretty good job with a feeble script, but he's miscast as a ship-in- bottle building accountant. Susan Sarandon as the lush mother-in-law is (over)acting in a different movie, Saiorse Ryan does a very competent turn as a green-screen cypher in dreamland, but the whole thing simply doesn't hang together.

Susie's story kept reminding me of Jodie Foster in 'Contact' - but there, the CGI other-world was very much the whole point. Here, the CGI's a digression from the story, such as it is. A family disintegrates after the sex murder of the favourite daughter? Smothered by CGI. A father tracks the murderer of his daughter with help from the afterlife? Smothered by CGI. Take away the CGI and you have an unfocused, predictable melodrama with a deus-ex-machina ending poorly disguised as supernatural intervention.

I did think Michael Imperioli as the detective was a good turn at first, but as with the rest of the script, nothing is done with the character and you may as well be watching 'Murder, She Wrote'. Any episode of 'Columbo', or even 'Quincy' has more story than 'Lovely Bones', which completely misses the mark.

This movie was just plain horrible. I actually feel as though I need to apologize to the person I borrowed money from so I could rent it. I hated how there were about ten scenes that had what I call 'Plotless Time Expanders' or PTEs. The finding the journal/chase scene were awful. Jackson was just determined to drag those out as far as possible without thinking about them clearly. And despite the fact that the OBVIOUS MURDERER is in the house the sister keeps READING THE JOURNAL! How realistic is that? And oh the ending. Sorry if I like justice but the killer just getting hit on the head and falling down the cliff. He may as well just lived to be a hundred and died of pneumonia. Honestly how God awful this movie was. Now, I could go on but I think I'll end the complaints there. There were moments that were artistically intriguing. That is all I have when it comes to giving a compliment. Please take all copies of this movie and bury them. Forever.

Adapting a film from a source material that is anything but intended for cinema is always a tricky thing to do. Judging by the largely negative criticism this film received, Alice Sebold's novel by the same name is apparently gutted by director Peter Jackson. Apparently, because that is exactly what some mainstream critics seem to think. On the other hand, I have not read Sebold's novel. As such, I think it's safe to assume that my experience may have been better than those who did read her book. Even so, I'm sure my experience was a lot better than those who read it and watched the film with the sole intention of harshly comparing one to the other. Even J. K. Rowling has her fair share of 'haters' when you talk about what Harry Potter does on screen, as compared to what he does in one of her books. So the next time you decide to lash out at a film maker for not living up to your novel (pun unintended) experience, think for a minute what it would be like to watch a movie, adapted word for word from the novel it's sourced. Even if you read one page at the rate of one minute, how would a 300 or 400 page novel translate into a 300 or 400 minute movie? Even if that were possible, what good would it be if the source material was not altered for the screen? And why shouldn't it be, given that both mediums are limited in creativity. 

So coming back to the subject on hand, and since I did not read the novel, I can say without a pause, that the movie experience was decent enough to have had me glued to the screen from beginning to end. In her narrative, Saoirse Ronan (pronounced Ser-Sher) explains her character's tragic end and what happens after. As Susie Salmon, Ronan portrays a time in America when "do not talk to strangers" was an unheard-of caution; a time when children could roam freely and not have to live in fear of preying eyes. Sadly enough, talking to a stranger was the last thing Susie Salmon did, before being murdered, dismembered and never to be found again. But this is where her story begins, first discovering her own death, then being stranded between her overwhelming feeling of vengeance towards her murderer and watching her family suffer and tear apart during their untimely loss. It is at this juncture, or the "in-between", as she calls it, where Susie shockingly learns that she is not the first, but the most recent victim in a series of brutal murders. 

Questionable by some critics, is Jackson's use of strong visual effects in portraying Susie's transition into the "in-between". After "King Kong" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, we see why Jackson is well endowed in the CGI department. That said, even having Steven Spielberg sign on as executive producer could not have influenced Jackson into telling Sebold's story in any other way but his. Visuals are crisp, abstract, and fluent while his color palette is deep yet intense with contrast, resulting in images that will push your Bluray player and HD display to the max. Is it needed in a murder mystery? Not really, because the plot is not much of a mystery; it is an innocent 14 year old girl's narration of the after-life. Again, this is where cinema CGI has the edge over raw imagination, especially when reading a book. As far as mystery is concerned, there is none. After school one day, Susie doesn't reach home because she has been lured into an underground den, specifically engineered to entice under aged girls. Her last moments are spent with her captor, a seemingly average Joe. Playing this monster is the versatile Stanley Tucci in what has to be one of his best roles thus far, deservingly earning his first Academy Award Nomination in a supporting role. Although his offering is top notch, you can't help but notice the utter darkness oozing out of his character. If the eyes are windows to the soul, then Tucci does an exceptional job as George Harvey, complete with that unmistakable flicker of evil in his eyes. Other supporting roles come from Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as Susie's parents and Susan Sarandon as her grandmother. As always, Whalberg's rage-filled scenes are intense, but very rarely are his characters helpless. For the first time here, we get to see a combination of both. Sarandon's Grandma Lynn is questionable as this character does not add to the plot, nor can her inclusion be considered a sub-plot. But if there is ever a light moment throughout the film, it does come from Grandma Lynn. Another key character is played by Rose McIver as Susie's sister and in doing so, offers some of the film's intended suspense. 

This film succeeds as a drama. As a thriller, it could have been better. Comparing internet reviews between the book and the film will tell you that Jackson has chosen to leave the gory details out to get a wider audience. Although there are no actual scenes of rape, murder and mutilation, the act is heavily suggested during parts of the film and this is why it has a PG-13 rating instead of an R.

If there's one thing I dislike more than a bad movie it's a bad movie with aspirations of greatness. This movie wants to be great. A work of art. Possibly a masterpiece. I have no doubt that Oscars were whispered of at some point during production. But here's the catch: it's no good.

Something strange happened with the adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel "The Lovely Bones" by Peter Jackson and his collaborators. The book was one of the most read in the country after it was published. Unfortunately, what comes out on the screen is far from what Ms. Sebold wrote about, so the finished product is, at times, irritating, at best. The mere thought of translating the text into a motion picture, must have been a daunting work on the part of Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.

The story is a very intriguing one, but it is quite slow complete with holes and any parts that strived to be heartbreaking came across as mawkish. The script is quite weak often. But what hurt the film most was some aspects of Peter Jackson's direction. Jackson is a good director don't get me wrong(he was the main reason that I wanted to watch the movie), but he does make some decisions that detract from the impact of the story rather than enhance it. Especially with the CGI, not that it was bad CGI in fact it looked quite good, what I mean was that there was a complete overload of it and I think some of it was unnecessary. The movie is overloaded with fantasy scenes with too-loud sounds, and it omits much of the thoughtful narration of the murdered girl. The movie veers from mystery to fantasy, back and forth, satisfying neither format. And the small love-story between Susie and Reece is not portrayed with panache and it feels nothing more than a puppy love.

The Lovely Bones

However, the film does look absolutely beautiful, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The score gives a haunting, eerie and intoxicating quality too. While the story is flawed, there is a good atmosphere especially in the more chilling scenes, where they are quite chilling and that's an understatement. Apart from two performances, the acting is quite good. The best performance comes from the very promising child actress Saiorse Ronan, who is just tremendous here. She was perfect for the role. She has a beautiful spirit about her that makes you embrace her. She's so likable that that you care about her character and what happens to her. Thanks to the sweet-faced and deeply affecting Ronan, you'll never forget Susie Salmon. Stanley Tucci is very chillingly effective too, and Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly good. The two performances I wasn't so taken with were Rachel Weisz, who is wasted. She would have had a lot of scope for acting out her grief if the movie had stuck with the book, instead of rushing her out to the wine country of California and making it look like she had been away for just a few months. And then there is normally solid Susan Sarandon, who overplays quite badly. She plays the child's Grandma Lynn who appears early in the movie and does not really help the weak screenplay. Mark Wahlberg as the grieving father is just adequate. I believe the weak screenplay limited both him and Rachel Weisz.

The music, as opposed to fantasy sounds, is excellent. The locales are authentic and well-shot. The writing of dialog in the real-life "mystery" scenes is good. But there is an abundance of fantasy scenes which for us added nothing and frustrated our enjoyment of the plot and good acting. There's also a thriller aspect to the movie, and this part is well-done, but it's also overwhelmed by the excessive fantasy scenes.

Instead of focusing on how Suzie's feelings evolved while she was in the in between place, after her murder, Jackson resorted to inordinate amounts of special effects. The CGI worked well in Lord of the rings and Kingkong, but this movie needed a different kind of handling, with CGI being used only where essential. The special effects in this movie are overpowering and they eclipse the movie.

So, a movie that could have been a masterpiece which sadly isn't. Loads of plot holes, Unsatisfying ending and the unnecessary use of CGI spoils the movie So I rate it 5.5 out of 10.
