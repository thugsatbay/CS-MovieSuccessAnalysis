### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I don't give out 10 stars easily unless it's a film that can keep me guessing. A film that will make me want to see it through to the end, not because I paid hard earned cash, but because I truly care about the characters and where they're going to end up. If you like me, then you're going to want to see this one.

Will Smith has always been an interesting actor for me. I watch everything he does because I'm a huge fan. I must admit that the idea of him playing another heartbroken, distanced from the world individual (Hancock, I am Legend) made me a little annoyed, but this one was a home run. The character Ben Thomas is such a mystery that you want to know what he plans to do; for others, for himself, etc. As the story unfolds, so does his intentions and not in a really simplistic way. He's a complex person, but not so much that he aggravates me. He's intriguing.

The connection between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson is so well done and so believable. This is how it's supposed to be done. There's a chemistry in their acting that I haven't seen in about 10 years or so. I'm not exaggerating. I haven't seen too many films where the chemistry is genuine; kudos to the both of them.

It is very touching and sad, yet heartwarming. Geez, did I say that? I walked away from this one feeling good. That's what it is in the end. A feel good movie.

This is the first time I have ever posted. I saw this movie and it made me want to post. IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks

Let me start by saying I didn't care much to see this movie. Although the trailer left much to the imagination it looked quite boring.

The majority of the movie is mysterious, slightly confusing and will have you guessing a lot. It's almost hard to believe so many loose ends could be tied up as it nears its ending, but it does, and it does so beautifully. Everything culminates in this magnificent ending that will make you want to tell everyone you meet to go see this movie now.

Also, I'm the kind of person that is not easily moved. As a matter of fact I can't even remember the last time a movie made me feel something the way this one did.

I rank this as one of the top movies of 2008, along with TDK and Slumdog Millionaire. And definitely somewhere on my all time top five.

If this movie doesn't touch every sentimental nerve in your body and  reach to the core of your soul, you are not human. 
This movie will touch your heart in places you never knew existed. Each  of us has seen those movies that reach deep within and cause the light  tear to seep out of corner of our eyes and we quickly wipe it away and  hope no one sees us. You will indeed be seen crying on this one. You  will need a box of tissues. 
I do not know how or what the so called self critics are seeing, but I  don't think it's the same movie I just finished watching. Yes it's a  little slow, but its realÂ…. This is a human in tune with what he wants  and doesn't let ANYTHING stop him from completing what he started. 
It's a Shakespeare tragedy in today's society. A movie you should  definitely see.

If this film doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award, there is no justice. It was an astonishingly good film. The storyline unfolds piece by piece and keeps you guessing until the end, trying to figure out who this character is and what he's up to. The juxtaposition of such a dynamically humanitarian man being an IRS auditor is the first thing that piques your interest and the mystery grows from there. In order to be an excellent film, you need a good story, good screenplay, and good acting. Seven pounds has all that and more. The story was upheld by outstanding performances by Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper. It's more than a touching film. It's one of those rare films that actually makes you take stock of your life and reexamine your priorities. Kudo's to all involved.

Seven Pounds follows the story of Ben Thomas, an IRS agent on a mission to redeem himself from a haunting secret. We follow him on his mission to seek out seven strangers in desperate need of help. Ben's plans are complicated when he meets and falls in love with Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with a terminal heart condition. Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Seven Pounds is not a kick back and zone out film, you have to work as an audience member to put all the pieces together. The more you allow your mind to work in this film, the more you will get out of it.

This movie... is amazing. Not even watching "The green mile" and "Million dollar baby" did i get the same feeling i do off this. This is truly a masterpiece.

I wont go in to detail about the movie, since there is already a lot of comments here to get that information. No, i wright this comment ( my first ever) because i wanted to express myself. This is my new favorite movie, and if you don't go see it, you misses out one a truly amazing experience. I think i cried to 1 movie before, not a lot of crying, but still and that was green mile. But this.. this movie got me crying for real. The sacrifice Ben (will smith) makes in this movie is truly a gift for the people he does it too. I don't think i said to much to spoil anything, i hope not, cause that will be me taken the joy out of what is a amazing movie.

Now, after you read this, you should go buy this movie (when it comes on DVD), and watch it. And treasure it, and maybe it will bring something to your life, as it has to mine.

Love Tais.

This film blew me away. The acting was superb, the story was heart wrenching and I truly believed in the characters. Some of you may say that this film is just another in a list of movies such as Pay It Forward.

This is a fallacy. This film here grabbed me from the start and will stay with me for weeks. It's a very powerful film and Will Smith and the rest of the cast deserve our applause and respect for playing their roles so well. Credit to the scriptwriters and director for also allowing this film to exist, it was amazing.

A definite must see film and one worthy of nomination for awards.

This movie is one of the best films i have ever watched by far. The direction of the film along with the acting was simply world class. It's an emotional roller-coaster. Yes it is slow, yes it gets a little boring, but whilst your watching the movie your always taking in the story line and my does the movie make up for it in the last 30 minutes when the jigsaw is put together and the full plot is revealed. I think this movie is actually better than The Pursuit Of Happiness which most will know was also a very good film. Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper all deserve awards with there 10 out of 10 performances. This movie for me is a must see, i am still actually getting over the film as it quite simply blew me away.

Great frigging film.

Let me put that more eloquently.....frigging fantastic.

I was really moved by this work.

It was touching on so many levels.

and the acting and performances were nuanced, layered and authentic.

from all players.

really, really great work that brought tears to my eyes...more than once.

I won't go into the plot of the film. Just see it. The less you know the better.

Will Smith's best work to date. The man has so truly grown and CONTINUES to grow as an artist (and human being) - that's the part that really amazes me.

Excellent work by Mr. Will Smith. (and Rosario and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper, et al...)

*I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens. 

I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will was going around promoting the movie. He was great--spent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture Will! About Will's performance: A lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didn't picture the Fresh Prince (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance.

About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He's sad...guilt-ridden...very determined, but very scared. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth...and somehow, Will managed to bring that to life.

About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes. Maybe she's not the shining star Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Will's did.

About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. But when things eventually fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.

It actually takes a lot out of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment...

******* Minor SPOILERS***** Which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed, though. I will mention some of it here (without trying to give a lot away).

-The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense whatsoever. There was a LOT of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.

-I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of it, I loved him and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. Wait it out though. Everything in this movie: wait it out.

-Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for. It's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think it's a little bit of both...I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.

Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the "I'm going to make you cry" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.

Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancÃ©e. A year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, Ben, an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas. Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and moves in to their new home. Having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name Ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.

Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, I would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. Will Smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.

I am a terminal cancer patient. I pray everyday that somehow things will get better. Every 3 months I get another PET scan and the tumors have either grown or spread to another area. I remain optimistic and continue to hope and pray. I love my son and my wife and it hurts me that they must suffer with me. What I can do is make the best of what I have. I spend precious time with my family and tell them how much I love them. I do the same with my mother. She is so wonderful. In fact, all the people around me have been so helpful in anyway they can. I am so thankful for this. Whether I get better or not, I am so thankful for the life I have been given and for all the people around me that have been involved in my life.

In the beginning I didn't understand what was happening in this movie. When the pieces fell into place I realized why this movie is a 10 and why no other film could possibly stand up to it. Given the state that I am currently in, I have often asked myself if I am a good person. Have I done enough? Have I made enough sacrifice? What do I deserve? This movie gives words like caring, sharing, sacrifice, etc. a whole new meaning. Yes I was moved by this film and I still pray for myself. I also pray for others and am thankful for the life I have been given regardless of what lies in the future. If I have sparked your curiosity at all, then please do watch this film. This film portrays a value that words cannot describe.

It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because I'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so I'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.

Our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. Smith's Thomas has lists of names, one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. Working with the IRS allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give themÂ—a gift that could completely alter their circumstances. He calls an old childhood friend (Barry Pepper) and reminds him to do what it is he promised, to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. Even in a role as small as Pepper's, you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background, hanging above everyone's head. It is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. His breakdowns, whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions, show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.

After that phone call, begins the journey to meet new people. Thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk, trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. This progression takes many turns, from a "blind, vegan, meat salesman" that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient, unable to print her line of stationary, or even run with her Great Dane Duke; to an abused and scared Latino mother of two, too afraid to leave her boyfriend; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. There are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day, and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. Why it is up to Thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his "gift" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the IRS. As he says, though, "he kind of stumbled into the job".

Smith's quest as Thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. As a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. If that means he must yell and make fun of them, he must do it. At every step, though, you see the suffering in his eyes, the pain eating away at his soul, taking each step towards his fate, one as a saint of redemption, not only for those he wants to help, but for himself as well. It is an award-worthy performance and I only wish Smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles, because, while they are fun, this guy is too good for them. The man better win an Oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyÂ—at least in my mind.

The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. His shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. Elpidia Carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. And Rosario Dawson shines as the "once hot" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It is the introduction of Smith's Thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.

It baffles me how anybody can say a bad word about this film; the standard of acting... the mysterious, highly intelligent and gripping storyline... the amazingly thought-out scene sequence... the tearful scriptwriting... it all combines to make this film a definite 10/10. I have always liked films with a twist or two, I like a film to be unpredictable and trigger some emotions. Well, this film certainly did that. First of all, the cast members are all clearly highly trained and the best at what they do. Will Smith has always intrigued me as an actor, with his versatile acting ability. However, in my opinion, this film is far beyond what he has shown us before. There was no second-hand casting, as every person does an amazing job throughout the film, which is necessary for the heart-wrenching script/story. If the actors were not up to scratch, I dread to think what the outcome of Seven Pounds would have been like. The story is unexplainable, and I don't want to give anything away but the quality of the writing must have taken SUCH a massive amount of time and effort to produce, because the end result really has amazed the entire world. The way the characters all connect, and the story unfolds itself, is what can only be described as truly magnificent scriptwriting. I would love to have a conversation with the producers about how they connected everything together and tied all the loose strings up, because the story is very complicated and hard to get your head around, which is why you need to concentrate when watching. It is definitely not another Legally Blonde!

What makes the movie so astounding is the believability of the chemistry between actors. As I've said, Smith delivered in this performance and truly excelled himself for the role. However, his performance wouldn't have been as interesting to watch, if it was not shown to link in with the other characters, and the emotional relationships he has with them all. Of course, the most real of these relationships being the one which develops between him and Rosario Dawson, who plays Emily Posa. Another role well worth paying attention to, is Barry Pepper, who plays Dan. I found his role immensely realistic as Will's best friend, and thought Pepper did an excellent job which could easily be overshadowed by the other characters.

All in all, it is a must-see. I would recommend the film to anyone who enjoys drama and who doesn't mind shedding a few tears!

Seven pounds is unquestionably 10/10!

The IRS tax collector Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks out Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and resolves her situation with the IRS. Emily has a serious heart problem and is waiting for a donor, but her blood is very rare and her odds are low. Meanwhile Ben seeks out other people to help them in a journey for redemption for what he did in the past. However Emily and Ben unexpectedly fall in love with each other, but Ben does not have the intention of changing his plans. 

"Seven Pounds" is a predictable drama with a fragmented non-chronological screenplay about a man seeking redemption for what he did in the past that has shattered his world. The story is simple but the screenplay hides the secret about Ben until the very end. My vote is seven.

It's one of the brilliant emotional movies I had ever seen. Though the starting of the movie was kind of boring and I thought I would kill my friend who suggested to watch the movie.

But as it moved along towards it end I was in tears. The concept was superb and execution too was perfect. Great job by Wills Smith and so as Rosario Dawson. It's easy to make you laugh but it's quite difficult to make a person cry from his heart.

Everyone must watch this movie and it's really SEVEN POUNDS!!

I will rate it 10/10 and it's in one of my best ever watched movies in English language.

Seven pounds is definitely not the worst movie ever, or even comes close. But it is still very bad because you can see the pathetic attempt here to make something insidiously heart-warming and touching. To those who are paying attention though, the movie ends up coming off as the opposite. 

First, within minutes of this movie starting every one realizes what Tim Thomas(Will Smith) is trying to do. He's upset and obviously self-loathing, and I guess in a way he thinks he has good intentions. This will become clear in a minute. 

Basically, Tim stalks several random people. Why? Because he intends to donate parts of his body to them all after committing suicide. Do you see what is wrong with this picture already? This isn't just creepy, it's disgusting! It's sick! It's not heart warming, it's stupid!

In the meantime, we know what's going to happen, we already have figured out the inevitable conclusion to this film.

Even more retarded is that Tim intends to take his own life by sitting in a bathtub and letting a jellyfish kill him. This seems pretty over-the-top, dramatic and again, stupid. Why is it stupid? Because he intended to donate his heart to Emily Posa(Rosario Dawson), and correct me if I am wrong, but the Jellyfish poison would render the heart useless!!!!

Turns out Will Smith wants to commit suicide because he is responsible for a multi-vehicle crash where many people(including his wife) died. He wants to atone for what he did. Now, fact of the matter is that instead of sacrificing your life for a few people, why not just live your live saving as many people as you can to atone for your sins?

The answer? Because death is more dramatic! Basically because the plot needs him to die, no other reason!

Seven pounds is poorly written, and a desperate last-ditch attempt to get Will Smith an Oscar for best actor. It ends up being cruel, nihilistic, misguided and sickening in its moral philosophy.

Many moviegoers left theaters angry they had been duped by misleading movie promotions for Seven Pounds. But the damage of this misguided screenplay could extend far beyond the movie theater to potentially destroy hope and threaten the very lives of loved ones who suffer from depression, grief and post traumatic stress disorder. As a society, we should be concerned, if not outraged.

The movie is billed as an extraordinary love story, while in reality it deceptively showcases the benevolence of organ donation to justify and glorify suicide. The main character, Ben Thomas, is attempting to atone for causing a car wreck that kills his wife and six people in another vehicle. The excruciating pain of grief, depression and post traumatic stress disorder is extraordinarily deep and sometimes seemingly unbearable, as I know from personal experience. But the pain left behind for others when someone completes suicide is even greater. I also know this first hand, having lost my husband to suicide. There is hope even in situations that are perceived to be the darkest.

Yet this movie presents a romanticized portrait of suicide as the heroic answer. Let's get real and take a genuine look at the face of suicide -- the statistics are alarming. According to the latest official data for the United States, there were 32,637 lives lost to suicide in 2005; that's one person every 16 minutes. Set your watch or clock alarm to go off every 16 minutes Â– it won't take long before the numbers become agonizingly real. Ranked as the 11th leading cause of death behind a list of diseases and unintentional injuries, suicide claimed more lives than homicide. Each death by suicide powerfully affects at least six other people. If this not enough reason for concern, consider also that for every death by suicide, more than 25 attempts at suicide are made Â– that's more than 815,000 a year. Romanticizing suicide on the big screen could increase these numbers; research shows that portraying those who take their lives as heroic or romantic may encourage vulnerable people to identify with the victim and even contribute to copycat suicides.

The number of suicide attempts by young people between the ages of 15-24 skews even higher, more like 100 attempts to each suicide death. These numbers are significantly more frightening when you consider this age group represents a substantial portion of moviegoers who would be attracted to any Will Smith film. At such an impressionable age, what message about dealing with life is being role modeled for them in the movie "Seven Pounds?" Suicide in this case is erroneously portrayed as a noble solution with all the Hollywood fanfare. 

Fortunately, there are truly noble organizations, such as the Suicide & Crisis Center of North Texas, that have taken a strong stand to prevent suicide and provide healing support for those critically wounded in the wake of the suicide of a loved one. The risk of suicide hits closer to our homes, our schools and our workplaces than most realize. Reduce the risk by joining forces with such organizations and by speaking out.

During an interview this week in Dallas to promote the movie, Will Smith said, "It's important to stay connected and I work in an industry where it's easy to lose touch." Let's help Will Smith and Sony Pictures stay connected. Let's share real life perspectives about the dangers of glorifying suicide. Let's send a message to Hollywood.

Fantastic movie is Seven Pounds.I regret it seeing it so late after its release.Gabriele Muccino has directed a gem here.Great acting again from Will Smith(Ben Thomas) whom i admire very much after his role in that of Pursuit of Happiness.But this is class acting.Rosario Dawson's(Emily Posa) role is simply superb.She has given a great acting performance here.A performance that will surely touch you.Woody Harrelson(Ezra Turner) & Michael Ealy(Ben's Brother) have also given great performances.

The plot is very very good.The story has a great tempo.Slow to begin but catches up after the entry of the terrific Rosario Dawson.The ending is pretty tragic & sad.But will surely make tears to come out of your eyes.Very emotional & touching scenes by Will & Rosario together. Specially the last scene of Emily & Ezra looking at each other,where tears coming out from Emily.Thats so heart breaking.Recommended.Great Performance & superior directing.In one word,this movie is beautiful.

I saw this movie at least 5 times and every time it surprise me and touches me like the first time. And every time I I wondering how anyone could conceive such a perfect movie. The main idea of this movie is so simple yet so amazingly expressed by the directors and producers and through the characters. Will Smith's acting is just perfect. I think that he is the most complex actor alive. No one could be more perfect than him for this role. His character is complex, strange but a true hero. This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to everyone. This movie has kept alive my hope that there could still be people on this planet that want and can to make up for the bad things they caused in other's people lives. Definitely worth seeing!

Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie, or you just simply aren't touched by anything, it is worth seeing. Don't come into the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual, is amazing. I believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst/best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes YOU feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.

A hilariously misguided vanity project for Will Smith who wants to be a savior and win that Oscar! The twist is telegraphed from about twenty minutes into this thing and we have to endure a frowny face Will Smith for the entire running time of this fiasco, until the last few minutes of the film where the real comedy begins. This whole thing is creepy dreck, when it's supposed to be a profound drama, but the end is the stuff of unintentional comedy gold. Watching Will Smith commit suicide by jelly fish in a bathtub with the most bombastic dramatic score is epic. No SNL skit can ever reach it's comedic heights, Mel Brooks wished he directed that scene, no comedian in their right mind could come up with something so off the wall hilarious. It's the perfect example of the 'what were they thinking?' scene. Seven Pounds is as bad as they get.

The premise of this movie is impossible in the real world. There is absolutely no way that a person can donate organs to particular individuals by killing himself, as the lists used to distribute organs have multiple layers of anonymity built into them and there is no way of knowing who will wind up with the organs. Living people can donate some organs (like one kidney) or parts of organs (the right lobe of the liver) to particular individuals, but a dead person's organs can wind up being transplanted virtually anywhere in the country. Ridiculous plot. I hope nobody is stupid enough to imitate this pathetic movie in real life.

Oscar Performance across the board. This is one of the best movies ever made. The movie opens with only pieces of the story being told and those are out of sequence. It involves a young man, Ben Thomas (Will Smith putting in a phenomenal performance), and his life - past, and present.

The movie is so strong I don't know where to begin to tell you how involved the story is, yet how simple it plays. All I can say is that I was utterly drawn in and I think it was because I didn't read anything about the movie other than I remember someone telling me to see it.
