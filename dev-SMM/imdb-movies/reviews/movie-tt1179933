### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Following 2007's found footage film 'Cloverfield', 10 Cloverfield Lane is produced from the same womb as its predecessor - but is in no way part of the same breed. Most production companies operate under the false ideology that 'bigger is better', however in this instance Paramount Pictures has opted for a smaller scale production  and it is a sensational affair.

Vastly superior to its aforementioned predecessor, 10 Cloverfield lane bears little to no resemblance of its half-brother  and this works to its advantage in more ways than one. Firstly, the frantic and scatter shot 'hand-held' found footage technique of the first installment is ditched for more precise and intimate tripod filmed scenes. This makes the film vastly more interesting and more engaging than the chaotic shaky cam that plagued Colverfield. It is almost a breath of fresh air to see a movie that is so thoughtfully filmed. 

Furthermore, 10 Cloverfield Lane a story that is entirely compelling for the entirety of its runtime  at no stage does it slow down or become uninteresting, and at no stage are there any predictable moments. The dialogue is nothing short of brilliant and keeps you on edge from start to finish, also due to fantastic execution from its cast.

The true star of the film however  is John Goodman. In what may just be one of his finest performances in more recent years, Goodman keeps the audiences eyes glued to the screen and keeps you entirely engaged throughout. Cloverfield's acting wasn't at all that great  it was rather average in all honesty  but this film brings something else. Goodman puts on an absolute powerhouse of a performance, and the rest of the cast are brilliant strong as well.

Ultimately, Bolstered by an intriguing premise, brilliant performances and ever changing storyline, 10 Cloverfield Lane never becomes boring and never fails to intrigue, and is arguably one of the best Sci-Fi films of the last few years.

Two months ago, no one knew that 10 Cloverfield existed, let alone was about to be wide released in theaters. One month ago, no one had any idea how, if at all, this film was related to the 2008 film Cloverfield except for the obvious title and produced J.J. Abrams. And now, all is revealed. Sort of. Here's my review.

One of the greatest things 10 Cloverfield Lane has to offer is that the audience really has no idea what to expect going into the film. Very much in the J.J Abrams way, the production for this film has been left completely under-wraps and the trailers have revealed next to nothing. That's one of the benefits for the movies, so I'm not going to spoil or give anything away in my synopsis or the review. I won't even tell you if this movie is indeed a Cloverfield sequel or if it's something different altogether. You'll have to find out for yourself, because I can tell you right now that you should spend the money to go see it in theaters.

I'll be brief. A woman we know very little about named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car crash in a breath taking opening credit sequence. She wakes up a few days later to find herself in an underground bunker with Howard (John Goodman), a large and crazed eyed farmer standing above her. He tells her that she can't leave, because some sort of disaster has happened and it's not safe to go outside. Finding herself alone with Howard and another man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), and I'm stealing their tag line here because it's a dang good tag line, they find out that Monsters come in many forms.

Obviously I had no idea to expect when I went into 10 Cloverfield Lane. No one did. But within the first five minutes they set the tone so you know what kind of movie they are going for, and I found myself instantly engaged. For the rest of the film, I was floored with what was going on. Director Dan Trachtenberg takes the reigns on creating a film that will hit you with the unexpected, and leave your jaw hanging.

The best word I could think of to describe this film while I was watching it was claustrophobic. For the scenes that takes place in the bunker (I'm not saying how much of the screen time that actually is) they create such an intense and nervous atmosphere that you feel yourself getting antsy along with the characters. 

That's because for almost the whole film, we don't really know what's going on. We know what John Goodman is telling us and leading us to believe, but we have no idea if that's reliable or not. We discover things along with the characters, which is why this film is such a good build up. When the conclusion to the film finally comes, you leave more than satisfied. But don't ruin it for yourself by looking up online spoilers to see if it is a Cloverfield sequel. Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it.

I've heard the argument and I've sited it a few times in past reviews, that the best way to bring out great performances in actors is to lock them in a single setting film where they having nothing to hide their performance behind. That's what happens here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress who deserves to get more work than she does, played the character so well as she captures the nervous ticks without acting completely helpless the whole time. In the end, she was pretty bad-ass. John Gallagher Jr., a character who could have been super annoying, ended up being great in the film too, and had really good chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

But the stand-out of the film if John Goodman. John Goodman is in so many films every year that we sometimes take him for granted and forget how good of an actor he can be when he's not mailing it in (whatever Hangover film he was in. I forget) but rather commits whole heartedly to a role. That's what happens here. He could have easily over-cooked his performance where it came of as cartoon-y or unrealistic, but he hit just the right level of disturbing and off-putting where you are crept out by the guy but you can't be sure if he's in the right or wrong. It's a performance similar to Joel Edgerton's in The Gift.

ALSO just read on IMDb that Bradely Cooper's voice appeared over a cell-phone in one scene. I knew I had heard the voice somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it until now.

At no point of 10 Cloverfield Lane does the film slow down or lose interest. It uses it's hour and forty five minute runtime, a surprisingly long one for this type of film, to achieve the best possible effects. The film flies by and I found myself never wanting it to be over. 

10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie you should rush out to the theater to go see. Accept that you know nothing about it going in, and enjoy that experience. Because it's something that doesn't happen often and it's a rare gift when it does. 10 Cloverfield Lane has a lot to offer despite the fact that it's a very small film. In fact, regardless of the fact if they are in the same universe, I'll say I enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane more than I enjoyed Cloverfield itself. And I want to see the story continued in a sequel. 10 Cloverfield Lane gets an A-, it's one of my favorite films of 2016 so far. Go see it this weekend. " - brands42

10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.

First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.

I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster POV storyline.

Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year.

If this is going to be an anthology or if this is going to be followed by that rumored third installment that has been recently spoiled by J.J. Abrahms, I can say that nobody doubts about the secretly marketed "10 Cloverfield Lane" is a great movie on its own. And a movie that if it were spoiled by someone here or at any review would be cruel.

Since the start it reveals to be a movie that doesn't hide an ace, but a hundred.

The pace can be a little slow at the first half only to add more and more tension, hooking the audience and introducing them into the movie like they were one of the people inside that bunker.

John Goodman will be a real trend the future days thanking its superb performance. He's so twisty, complex developed character. He and Mary Elisabeth Winstead make the movie shine alongside the story.

The story is so little, then so game-changer, with twists and turns that are smart rather than empty. It's one of that makes you guess all the time.

The ending is more of a bang than a whimper. Even when it succumbs to the action and polemic moves, it will leave you on a grim and high note, pestering for another outing if it's any good like this.

If the "Cloverfield" that started it all was about speaking without breath and CGI scares, this "10 Cloverfield Lane" is about deeper intentions, deeper tension and personal stuff that is scarier than a giant monster. While the connection to that movie is not so remarkable until the finale, this installment is so brilliant on its own, so well marketed (without ruining any twist) and so well ended that will surely please any viewer who were looking for a damn good movie. This is a scary movie like the classic ones. Don't miss it.

I'll leave this review fairly concise. 

This film was originally called "the cellar" the premise being what we see for the first 90% of "10 cloverfield lane": an excellent, brilliantly-scripted thriller set in an underground bunker, the tension lying in the "goodie-or-baddie" mystery that is the owner of the bunker, Howard. He is telling our hero, Michelle, that she cannot leave because the air outside is not breathable due to an attack, probably nuclear. She wants to leave because she suspects that Howard is insane.

That premise right there is perfect. Is Howard telling the truth? Is he a deranged kidnapper? Will Michelle eventually decide to leave? Is the air really breathable outside? The magnitude of that intrigue would have made for a brilliant film. 

Would have.

This is when JJ Abrams and bad robot came in and basically did what they do with the end of every single project they ever take on. Ruin it. Ruin it absolutely horrifically. They have clearly seen monetary value in the name "cloverfield" and are insisting on making it a franchise. Do we expect monsters going into this film? Yes. Do we get them? Yes. Was it necessary? Absolutely one million percent no. 

10 minutes from the end of what had been a gripping film, we finally see Michelle leave, and escape the bunker. She realises that the air is still breathable. Now, "pre-abrams" as I'll refer to it, this would've been an excellent ending. A bittersweet tale of abuse, of loneliness from Howard's point of view, of revenge, of victory. But with a huge psychological trauma to go home with. Honestly this film would be perfect had it ended here. But it wasn't to be.

This is when the aliens come. We seem to in the blink of an eye turn from "the cellar", a brilliantly told thriller, into an Abrams, overly-Hollywood, big budget cringefest. For me, it wasn't the moment the spaceship came on the screen, it was the moment our timid hero, portrayed brilliantly up until now, who'd just been crying uncontrollably with relief at the air still being breathable, suddenly turns stern action hero. She looks up and says "you have GOT to be kidding me", in the same emphatic way we've seen in 600 "five out of ten" films down the years. 

I'm sorry, but you've just seen alien life. And that's your reaction? In what until now was a very realistic, well told suspense thriller? Not having it for a second. It was like we could see the moment Abrams took over. And it ruined what could have been a classic.

The remaining 9 minutes are nothing more than a glorified creature feature, culminating in our hero, who's suddenly lost all her emotions, driving off to help the "human resistance" fight against the aliens.

End of movie. What amazes me most is the number of critic reviews I've seen saying "the aliens are a metaphor for what is outside a person's lonely bubble of abuse" or some nonsense along those lines. Sorry guys but you're thinking WAY too much into it. This is a story of a money-grabbing company, who bought a perfectly good script, and ruined the ending with aliens. 

I'm not entirely sure what I expected in all honesty. It's Abrams. I saw the ending to LOST and vowed never to make the mistake of investing my time in any of his projects again. Sure enough, I made the aforementioned mistake again and it's almost as bad as LOST was (minus the 5 years of my life id invested for the lovey-dovey, semi-religious, out-of- ideas cop out snoozefest that was the ending to LOST). 

Abrams strikes me as one of those who inexplicably takes pride in disappointing his audiences, as if he feels he's somehow above them and that the negative reviews are just people who don't "get" him. I think in all honesty it's more a sign that he's just not very good at what he does. 

My advice? Turn off when you see Michelle remove her oxygen mask. Pretend that's the end and you have your film of the year. Watch on for yet another example of "how to ruin a perfectly decent project: by JJ Abrams"

5/10. 10 for the first hour and a half, minus 5 for the last 10 minutes.

Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named "Cloverfield." Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.

Yes, that is the power of film; it can bring people together in the most unlikely ways possible.

So, it's with some excitement that we were blindsided by the brief and vague advertising campaign for 10 Cloverfield Lane. Does it have any connections to the original Cloverfield? What's JJ Abrams playing at here, exactly? Without giving too much away, it's not a direct sequel, but rather a sequel in tone. I'm assuming Abrams is going for an anthology style series here, with each entry being a different story tied together by their themes and science-fiction setting. It's clearly a marketing thing, but if that means we'll get more films like this, I'm certainly okay with it.

10 Cloverfield Lane eschews its predecessor's found-footage trappings, and immerses us in a classic style bottle thriller. The setting is limited and claustrophobic, and the cast small, but the story and tension will grab you and not let up until the end. The nature of the mystery means your opinion will hang very precariously on whether you like that ending, and I suspect it will be divisive. There's not a great deal of resolution, and if I'm correct in assuming this will be an anthology series from now on, I doubt we'll ever get any. But that's fine, because I don't think the story that would follow the film really needs to be told.

What matters are the performances. John Goodman is the real draw card here. He gives a stunning turn that is delightful, sympathetic andabsolutely terrifying in equal doses. He's had so many great roles in the past, but he is unforgettable here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very likable as the resourceful protagonist. Perhaps a little too resourceful at times, but for the most part we're with her happily throughout.

The film looks fantastic despite the cramped environs, with great use of color and shadow and some interesting cinematography. There are some nice designs and special effects toward the end of the film, even if they may be considered a little derivative. The score is tense and effective, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

In my opinion, the script is great with very little flab, and if you like these kinds of stories which lock characters together in tight, paranoid spaces then you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Just don't go in expecting Cloverfield 2, because this is not it. It's its own beast, and has a brave ending that you'll either love or hate.

It isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.

'10 Clover-field Lane' is a perfect reminder that films can still surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.

Of course, it always helps to have the likes of J. J. Abrams and Bad Robot standing behind you, and their experience and talent absolutely boosts this film into the stratosphere.

As far as acting is concerned, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her best performance yet, and shows us a strong lead character who's completely believable in a situation that plays out like a horrible nightmare. Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic.

I've been thinking about what film I could use to compare '10 Clover-field Lane' to, and while I think even a comparison to a specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it is absolutely Hitchcock. It's a brilliant, brilliant movie that's told in the best possible way: by showing, not telling.

Go and see it as soon as you can.

First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.

'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves as a sequel to the 2008 hit 'Cloverfield'. I have to say, it's hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.

Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)

John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.

The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.

I will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about it on the internet. I can't recall the last time a movie kept me guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual clichés in movies, buy your ticket to '10 Cloverfield Lane' and enjoy your time at the movies.

Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!

To describe 10 Cloverfield Lane in one word: Genreless.

I won't say much about the film as I'm a strong believer of going in blind, but I will say that the performances, writing, and cinematic pacing worked perfectly together to create a truly unique film.

I loved watching it, and the moments of comedy sprouting up throughout made the duality between light-hearted humanity and dark confusion work perfectly together. I would give the Titles and Credits 10/10 as well, because they were just so damn fantastic and fresh and reminded me that titling is an art form like any other in the cinematic Genre. If you enjoy good film, you will enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane.

I love the film and am trying to figure out how to write a review without giving anything away. 

A woman on the road at night is suddenly in an accident. When she wakes up you immediately start wondering what direction this film could go in. It could go down several different paths. You think you've got it all figured out. Based upon what you are seeing, there really is no other way to go. Wrong.

At some point things seem to settle into some harmonious normalcy but then things get ugly and disturbing. Always were a bit disturbing but more ominous.

The acting is excellent by everyone, the twists and turns very good especially since these three characters are in an underground bunker. It is edge of your seat, leaning forward intensity. A wild ride for sure. Check it out!

I never write reviews. ever. This is probably my first EVER.

This movie was so bad that I had to write this review and even if one person doesn't watch it because of my review, I will feel accomplished.

98-99% of the movie is in a bunker with two guys and a girl. I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen and finally last few minutes of the movie. The girl finally escapes the bunker (she was originally forced into it) just to find out most of the Earth is taken over by aliens and the best part, she was able to destroy one alien ship with a bottle of liquor. For a girl who runs away from one sign of problems, she did pretty good with an alien chasing her and a ship carrying her in a car in the air. Like what?

I can't anymore. I just can't.

Why can't I vote 0 stars?

Goodman plays Howard, a paranoid psychopath and the proprietor of a large underground hideout, built for the occasion. In said hideout, he plays house to two co-dwellers: a bearded moron (John Gallagher Jr) and an attractive young lady played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Is there really a threat outside, will Howard behave himself? The problem is, after 20 minutes of tedious scenario and bland characters, who really cares?

The film never picks up any speed, sports no subplots, feels like it could go anywhere without sticking to any internal logic (which indeed it doesn't) and merely serves hollow and underused characters. 

It's obvious the writers of this project wanted to fuse two genres of film but ended up having half the audience wet their pants over the ridiculous ending in which an alien spacecraft is destroyed by a bottle of Single Malt and the other half of the audience so abashed, they dare not admit they just wasted 2 hours of their lives.

Why is this movie so critically acclaimed? 

It's your typical horror/thriller. Except this time they're stuck in a bunker with a nutcase who shoots a guy then gets blown up.

Aliens don't show up until the end and Mary Sue, that's what she is not her name, blows their ship up with a molotov cocktail.

Overrated trash, just like the original Cloverfield. People love it based on name and the insane amounts of viral adverting the series loves to exploit.

If this movie had been called anything else, it would not only been a flop, but the same people praising it would be the most critical.

I loved Cloverfield which for me was one of the best films of the 21st Century. I saw it in a cinema and loved it and watched it a dozen times since on DVD and still love it. 

Cue Super 8 which insinuated it had a Cloverfield connection but was just about a bad CGI alien spider that made a space ship out of a water tank. Not a bad movie but not great either. 

Then out of the blue comes a trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane which may or not be a Cloverfield sequel. The clever use of the word Cloverfield hints at a connection and then J.J. Abrams feeds that with his comments. 

If like me you loved Cloverfield then try to be unlike me and don't waste 10 pound on this absolute crock of a movie. Massively disappointed and feel cheated after watching this garbage.

A girl wakes up after a crash in an underground shelter with a young bloke with a poorly arm and John Goodman. He tells her he 'rescued' her as there had been an attack and it's not safe above ground. 

In the trailer we see 

.....the girl fight her way up the stairs and peer out the doorway with a look of shock. Con trick as it's not what you (and I) probably thought. 

.....Something huge seems to walk over the shelter causing stuff to fall on the floor. Again a completely unexplained scene that later makes absolutely no sense at all. 

.....The famous drum scene as Goodman dons gloves and starts to open a 40 gallon steel drum. Could it be a Clovy parasite? Or something equally strange and interesting? No it's a nothing scene that reveals nothing we imagined it would be. It does have a bit of shock value and is a central plot device for the finale but still nothing of any great interest to Cloverfield fans. 

......Then the outside scene with the explosion the gas mask and the light and roar approaching the barn. When that was revealed I thought WTF? 

There we have it. Whilst there may have been some cursory nods to Cloverfield they flash by so quickly that they are not noticeable without freeze and rewind buttons which my cinema did not have. Simply clever marketing using the name Cloverfield prominently to attract attention to a pretty dull psycho film with some utter bilge to end it with. It says something when the film makers have to nick scenes from the incredibly awful WOTW by Stephen Spielberk. 

The acting was very mediocre with John Goodman, who is a great actor, seemingly catching a nap as he delivered his lines. The sound was terrible and even in a cinema I could barely hear what was said. The CGI for the finale would make the Sci-Fi channel blush. 

I left the theatre 10 pound lighter robbed of nearly 2 hours of valuable time and completely disillusioned with J.J. Abrams All that for this complete twaddle that Alan Smithee would disown.

May contain spoilers so read at your own risk.

Pretty much the WORST potential sequel to an unpredictable monster/destruction/action movie ever. Firstly, this lacks nearly all of those characteristics. Second, when did we find out that this was an alien attack in the first movie? It's almost expected of us to know this as we're waist deep into the second movie before we even discuss what could be outside the bunker. Oh, yeah... right... the bunker, the one we're forced to see from nearly every angle possible because 95% of the movie takes place in it. I feel like I know more about the bunker than I do about the surrounding area, location, and what is happening outside. Completely horrible. I expected MAYBE half of the movie to take place in the bunker, but no... 1hr 20mins into a 90~ min movie, and we're still in there, without having seen one monster aside from John Goodman's angrier side when he realizes Winstead's not going to play the role of his lover/daughter, or whatever. This is literally a movie about a crazed man who has the perfect excuse to kidnap this girl who he "bumps" into on the road during the unfolding events of what I assume is the first movie, but we'd never know because we're never told that! Do yourself a favor, and wait for this to hit red box for a dollar rental... or just skip it entirely and watch re-runs of Real World/Road Rules challenge. The scripted drama is far better in those shows than in this. Winstead should have done another Scott Pilgrim film instead of doing this, and the budget they probably spent on making this movie was likely minimal.

Awful does not even begin to describe this mess of a movie. I am absolutely gobsmacked by all the positive reviews here and on rotten tomatoes.....Or maybe I live in an alternate universe? This is right up there with overrated movies like Gravity and Inception.

Anyone ever see South Park's ImaginationLand episode where they interview Hollywood directors for ideas on how to stop terrorist from taking over? They interview and dismiss one crap big time Hollywood director after another until they got to Mel Gibson-who actually had an idea that made sense...Then they conclude, "say what you want about Mel Gibson, but he knows story structure".

Whoever wrote and directed this pile of steaming garbage does not know story structure.

So, I watched the first one knowing nothing about it and walked out of the theater with even less knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. This one is exactly the same. I didn't put 2 + 2 together about this movie being a sequel (kinda) to the other one. Had I known that, I would not have wasted my money.

These people need to choose a plot and stick with it. The first part was going along pretty well, it could have been a good movie, then the end ruined it. It was like someone taped the end of another movie to the reel. And the end was ridiculously dumb, just like the 1st movie. I will never see another movie with the word "Cloverfield" in the title. I mean, the least they could have done is tied up all of the loose ends from the first movie.

How much did the producer pay the critics on rotten tomato to write positive reviews? This movie was EXTREMELY BORING up until the last maybe 5 minutes. It starts as a crazed doomsday prepper finally getting his wish and using his bunker, but with a twist he's a crazed murder. He kills off the guy, we find out he kidnapped a girl, and the main girl escapes only to find aliens polluting the world with a flammable gas. She kills it with a bottle of whiskey, lighting it on fire. It ends with her going to Huston to help save others. Very boring. I would have rather had a movie on the old man and him with the kidnapped girl. I just want to know where I could request to get my money back. Terrible.

The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a "found footage" film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.

I love nothing more than a well created mystery where the audience are left in the same confused state as the character/s and are filling in the pieces of the puzzle as the same pace that they are. This is one of those films. I see it was originally titled 'The Cellar' before it was reworked into a 'Cloverfield' sequel and I can very well imagine it working all on its own as a stand-alone thriller. 

John Goodman is the star of the show. He truly can be a brilliant actor when he sets his mind to a character. He plays the role perfectly never giving away any more than he needs to and adds to the mystery surrounding everything perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also impressed me in the lead role. She's likable and bad ass depending on the scene and plays both equally well.

I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. I think it helps when you go in with no real expectations (as I can imagine a lot of audience members doing for this type of film) and then just out of nowhere you find yourself enjoying the hell out of it. As previously stated I won't give anything away, which leaves my hands tied a touch in discussing one of the key aspects of the film. All that's really left to say in that case is see this film!

First of all, I must say that I was expecting 'something different' considering the 7.3 note here! Something really worth of that note, but this is not that great!

As many have pointed out, this film has a problem with ending. I would have ended the film when she sees the birds flying. But that alien / mars attacks ending was just totally out of the blue. Totally not connecting with the film ( though I admit it proves the story that something bad had happened). I mean... even if they really wanted the alien ending, it could have been more subtle. This was like you added a totally different movie to the one you are doing.

Good point is that you really DO NOT know if the guy who held the girl in the basement is good or bad. We do not know if he killed anyone before he took the life of the guy in the basement. Everything is up to you to decide. All in all, he is actually a good guy from what we were seeing up to the point when he shot the guy ( but only when he said he would take his gun).

All in all, this maybe could have a better note if it wasn't for such laughable ending. I did not like it.

5 from me.

Spoilers Ahead:

First, if you are serious about watching this, do not read this review I will just wreck it for you. I never put a warning like this before a review of mine but the whole movie is one question: Is he an insane survivalist, stalking sex maniac or has there really been an attack? Spoiler: Now, for the rest of you, from the first frame Goodman behaves in a contrived, threatening manner that is so phony that you feel the con coming right away. The reason he had to behave like this, thematically, is to relieve the main flaw of the movie: Boredom. Be warned, you spend eighty minutes trapped in the guy's basement, I could describe to you, in intricate detail every crack or crevice in her cell / room. This goes for every single room, get ready to see every one of the few rooms forever. Did you think Carpenter's The Thing was boring and claustrophobic? That is like Dances With Wolves for geographical freedom, brace yourself. The admirers simply never notice how unreal Goodman acts all throughout the movie. After she sees the 'victim' begging to come in, Goodman goes Bat S and begins acting like a stalking rapist, then he offs beard boy. My main objection was highlighted by a good reviewer above me, who gives a giant crap? You really won't, you will just want it to hurry up and end. 

Trying to get you to identify with Winstead, by making you spend the whole movie trapped with her, was done better in Misery. Have more ambush attacks that almost work, like in that Oscar winning movie. The best summary is: You are trapped with Goodman, he acts kooky, after the survivor, he flips the F out. The intelligent viewer senses the con, we know why he is acting more and more like a rapist abductor, you will not be surprised at the 'shocking' conclusion. Spoiler: They traveled across space, which requires generating a singularity, but one of their ships is destroyed by a flaming bottle of booze hurled half ass into its opening? Why didn't she just flatulate at it? It had just as much probability. Please, stop, people were laughing all through the room. The movie avoids any other empirical evidence of answering the riddle other than the frantic survivor. He has no video / cell phone pictures of any sign of them about his place? He never obtained any small shred of evidence to show Winstead or Beard Boy about the truth of his assertions? Come on, it is just such an obvious plot contrivance to generate phony suspense. As I said, logically you will know the truth just by asking yourself why they didn't give him more proof to proffer.

Besides excruciating, butt compressive, hemorrhoid bursting boredom, you will feel insulted by how stupidly and clumsily the movie plays with you. Notice how, after she sees bad skin woman, Goodman changes from oddly menacing to absolute sex mad, stalking psycho boy? As entertainment, the more accurate title is: Trapped in a basement for ninety minutes with Rosanne's husband. Goodman is a good actor, I enjoyed him in Sea Of Love and The Babe. Even in Barton Fink, he gave an excellent performance. As good as an actor as he is, the director has placed the entire movie upon his shoulders; he does what he can, but Marlon Brando could not have saved this movie from boring the living crap out of viewers. Be warned, if you endure the movie for the last few minutes of effects, one word: Don't. The ship seems to be piloted by aliens who had too much chili, it gives off their gas which conveniently ignites objects. Winstead survives a two story fall without the slightest apparent injury. The only realistic part is where she hears that the 'resistance' has taken back the Eastern seaboard. Yes, if a flaming bottle can blow up one of their vehicles there is great hope for humanity. I am getting out my old slingshot. Please, the movie blows. RUN!! Q.E.D.

*Spoilers further ahead so read at your own risk!* I just got out of the cinema after catching the late show of this film on a Saturday night. Now, let me just start off by saying that I have walked out of movies I hated before, sat through movies I hated right until the very end, and movies I absolutely praised to the heavens (I think all of us have been in all of these 3 categories at least once in our lives when it comes to movies).

However, a fourth category has now emerged for me and reared its ugly head - and it is perhaps the worst one of them all! When it comes to "10 Cloverfield Lane", this was the very first time I've EVER sat through a movie for its near-2 hour running time, in complete tension and suspense, only for the last 30 minutes to come unhinged so abruptly and vapidly.

Why were so many plot elements introduced throughout the film if absolutely none (and I mean NONE) of them were addressed? This is the problem with filmmakers nowadays - many of them have the ability and talent to showcase excellent traits of a movie, such as atmosphere or good casting choices (as is the case with this movie. More on that later). But none of them have the ability to tie it all together into a cohesive story. Boring and incomprehensible are two things this movie is NOT, but that still doesn't mask the fact that the filmmaker had no idea where he was going with this, and that's very clear from the outset.

Comedy was interspersed throughout the film in little sprinkles, but none of it manifested into anything remotely humorous, given the circumstances. Many films work under the pretense of adding a black comedy component, but it simply doesn't work here.

And then we get the absolute worst ending I've ever seen - what were we supposed to take away from this? That our female heroine suddenly has "combat skills" and "medical expertise" just because she can crawl through a tiny ventilation system and treat a cut with stitches? Is it supposed to be a rush of sudden girl power? GIVE ME A BREAK! The main protagonist wasn't even the least bit likable, which slightly alienated me from the start. What was the point of the subplot having to do with Michelle's husband calling her repeatedly before the events of the film? Or the one about Howard's-daughter-Megan-that-turned-out-not-to-be-his-real-daughter? Or something like that.

Do any of these things really matter anyway? Nope, because none of them were addressed! And this is what I'm talking about when I say that there was no semblance of a cohesive story. There wee very trace amounts of character depth or perception illustrated here - just a case of more questions being asked than answered, followed by a hallmark of trite clichés to wrap things up before the culmination of the 103 minute runtime. And then.... aliens????? REALLY??? 

Now, for the one big positive about this film - John Goodman's performance. He didn't fail to impress here, as per usual, but with a script this lackluster not even his overpowering tour-de-force can save this one. I wish that were the case, though.

I have never felt the need to write a public review for a film, but this one is different. I feel like i wasted 2 hours of my life watching '10 Clover-field Lane'. Here's why:

- 95% of the film is set in a bunker, with it's own story line. But in the last 10 minutes, we are introduced to a whole new story line (with an uncertain context) which appears it will continue into a part 2. 

-As for the first story line, the end goal was predictable, which wasn't very exciting. 

-Going from a terrestrial film for 95% and then changing to extra- terrestrial, and expecting an immersed viewer to adapt in 5 minutes is ridiculous.

The only thing i will give to the film is the unpredictability of the immediate following scene. i.e. Not what was going to happen overall, what was going to happen to get there.

As i said, i have never felt the need to write a film review before, but i feel robbed, of my time.

Maybe to be attached to that "Cloverfield" movie back in 2008 (Does the time fly?) is the only misstep of this powerful movie. And that thing can be quickly pardoned. Because "10 Cloverfield Lane" is a surprising masterpiece of tension at a small scale that leaves the audience with a big chill far away from the theater.

The less you know about the movie, the better. Also the less you expect somewhat of a direct follow up from the previous, even much better. Although that won't be a problem because the pace of this movie grabs you since the moment Mary Elisabeth Winsted picks the car and then it never let you go. The story is inventive and involving as well the round of performances. Menawhile Winstead is marvelous in the movie and Gallagher Jr. is really good there is John Goodman who gives the really first Oscar-worthy performance of the year. Goodman has always being associated to a comedic roles and he is fully capable of it. But in this terrific thriller he's masterful and flawless. Every time he appears steals the screen.

With a conclusion that will divide the audience (I personally loved it, leaving you terrifically satisfied and pinning up for more) and counting some people that may find this movie a bit of hollow because they were looking for a more prominent monster, "10 Cloverfield Lane" is a brave and groundbreaking "sequel" that has turned itself into its own. Its "blood connection" to the first may be more for a ticket sale rather than a continuation, but this is a independent movie that must be experienced immediately. Don't let anyone to spoil you anything of the plot.
