### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Upon first viewing the trailer I was immediately giddy to see a new post-apocalyptic film in the vein of The Road Warrior. Being a fan of the genre, one must get used to the repetitive "lone wanderer" theme so prominently used. I figured this film would go through the same formula, but prepared to enjoy myself.

Yes it did use the lone wanderer as a driving plot device, and yes it did bring the arbitrary twist. Yes all the survivors are short on t-shirts, but live in a wealth of leather and goggles. Yes everything in this film looks like and feels like a typical post-apocalyptia. But the substance of the story is far more powerful then I could ever have expected.

Without giving away too much, yes the film is essentially a Christian metaphor. Eli seems to be protected by some mysterious force, guided by "God" to head west. But it's what the meaning behind this admittedly bizarre plot that makes this film so great. It truly is a film about faith and believing in one's self. Using the dreary post-apocalyptic backdrop, the film is able to contrast this powerful message with the harsh landscape. Even amidst such despair, one can rise and accomplish anything. In a world slowly becoming apocalyptic itself, this message is much welcomed.

The other aspects lending to the power of The Book of Eli are its technical aspects. The cinematography is simply beautiful. Moody slo-mo shots abound with wonderfully toned colors. Everything looks dark and dead, the sun beating down endlessly on the dusty dunes. The soundtrack adds immensely to this feeling, using soft ambient chords and blasting action-scene drums when necessary. Overall The Book of Eli is an excellent film itself and an excellent spin on the post-apocalyptic genre. 

Oh yeah, and Denzel Washington actually manages to pull off the part of a wizened, old bad ass.

Not sure how much the church was involved with this project, but it seems as though it was funded almost entirely by the church. And maybe Oprah. If not, the church should provide the people who made this movie with free blessings for a year - or whatever.

This movie uses misleading advertising to draw us in. (which goes against the messaging in the movie....) What we expect is an apocalyptic thriller with a super strong survivor trying to make his way through life. We know from the advertising that he has a book he must protect - but we are not told that it is a bible. The last bible.

The movie progresses normally for about the first 1/3rd or so. And then the propaganda begins. Despite Eli's best efforts, his friend and the villains become aware that he has a bible. The villain wants the bible to begin a cult in his own name, Eli wants the bible because a voice told him to go to a place where the book was, and then, vaguely, to go west. He reads it every day. The premise of the film is that he followed the voices instructions, found the book, and has been walking west for the past 30 years. (it seems Eli could have used some help from Forrest Gump) The movie devolves into actions segments spaced between dialog about the bible and faith. If that is your thing enjoy. My feeling on it was that the acting was not bad, the feel established by the cinematography for the movie was good but overall this film was a transparent vehicle for religious cheer leading and not much more.

The Book of Eli has the potential to be a great film or complete rubbish depending on your expectations of what is to come. If you are looking for a film with some deeper meaning then I would not recommend it. However, if you are looking for a film with beautiful cinematography, solid acting and a little bit of fun action then you will be pleased.

The key in watching the film is to not buy into the plot too much, which is where the viewer is going to be disappointed. The ending is a little far fetched and I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Although I honestly don't see a particularly good ending for the basic premise of the film.

If you are able to put the silliness with the story behind you, the film is wonderfully done. There is great camera work with interesting angles and framing; the set showcases the contrast between the stark light of the sun and the shadows where humankind is hiding; and the acting makes you want to buy into the characters and their conflicts.

I would recommend seeing the film, just don't get too involved with the story. Instead concentrate on the acting and the scene.

I have to agree with one reviewer that stated the movie should have ended with the shot of Eli's eyes. Solara becoming the next warrior is ridiculous. The actors were fine but why doesn't Denzel Washington realize that most of the movie doesn't make sense. He uses his bow in the first scene and takes the arrow. After that we don't see where he carries his bow until he needs it later in the film. He has his backpack emptied a couple of times and no shells for his guns or bow is seen. After killing the 2 guys he didn't take his arrows. Eli then tells Solara to take down the bow and wind up the bowstring and he is carrying 1 arrow. In the next scene the bow and arrow are absent. In the opening scene the sky is ominous and an eerie green with particles falling from the sky. At the end of the movie Alcatraz has blue skies, clouds and grass. Am I expected to think it took Eli 30 years to walk across the US? Were those plastic wrapped twinkies that he was sharing with Solara? How would they have tasted 30 years later? Would someone explain how he got out of the locked room (I missed that part)? The house where they were in the shootout with Carnegie and his henchmen was completely full of bullet holes except where the old couple and Eli/Solara were standing. When Solara causes the vehicle she's in to crash how does Eli's blade (which was on the dashboard) get embedded completely to the hilt in Redridge's chest? Is the woman hijacker (with the grocery cart) the same as the second one nearer to the end of the movie? If so how does she get a new gang (since Eli has killed all of her first friends) and get further down the road towards Alcatraz for Solara and Eli to meet again? To have the same ambush using a woman crying with a grocery cart seems lazy to me. Now after dictating the entire bible (with a big hole in his gut/chest) the bible is printed, leather bound and gold leafed only to be placed on a shelf where no one is going to read it. I'm glad for those who enjoyed the movie. It just has too many questionable and unbelievable scenes which caused my frustration. And I wish people would stop comparing this sham of a movie to 'The Road'.

Everybody's talking about what happens after the apocalypse these days.  "The Book of Eli" is sort of the boiling point of this science-fiction  concept, a combination of last year's "The Road" and George Miller's  "The Road Warrior." America is a post-apocalyptic wasteland and Denzel  Washington is the only self-sufficient badass. So originality is not  exactly "Eli's" calling card, but it clearly establishes its ruinous  world and the Hughes brothers ("From Hell") take good care of its  characters while supplying top-notch action. 
Washington stars as our stolid protagonist, Eli, journeying westward  with his canteen, a large machete, a couple guns and a special  leather-bound book. He lives on an Earth that was fried 30 years before  by the sun because of a war that ripped a hole through the ozone layer.  Sun-goggled bikers run amok pillaging, killing and raping passers-by,  yet Eli is morally sound and focused on keeping his book safe no matter  what so he can deliver it somewhere out west. 
Although written by a first-time screenwriter and former PC Gamer  editor, Gary Whitta, "Eli" impressively creates its world between the  sunglasses/goggles due to the sun's power, trading of goods because  money's obsolete and the constant examining of hands to determine if  someone is jittery from eating too much human flesh. Whitta also places  Eli squarely in the story. He's a good but dangerous man who's not  afraid to kill, and as he sits idly by as a couple gets attacked, it's  abundantly clear that this is a world where compassion is secondary to  survival and self-interest. 
Where the plot comes in is "Eli's" weak link. It doesn't try too hard  to hide just what exactly the book is and that sort of dissolves some  of the film's mystique. The plot is essentially Eli wants to protect it  and take it west and he has a run in with Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an  older man who runs a small town and desires it for selfish  power-related reasons. Along the way, anyone who threatens to lay a  hand on Eli gets sliced up or shot. In the two or three fight scenes  where he takes down numerous guys at once, you can't help but wonder  why after he kills the first few guys, the others don't run the hell  away, especially considering people are otherwise in self-preservation  mode living in a wasteland (and they know nothing of the book). 
The Hughes brothers make those scenes worthwhile, however. There's a  style and grace to their action scenes -- they create a sort of a  moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the  action sequences to make them more intense. When Carnegie's men  encounter Eli and the young woman (Mila Kunis) that he inspires who  follows him at the home of some old folks (cameos by famous Brits  Frances De La Tour and Michael Gambon), they place the camera in the  middle of the action and sweep along with the gunfire (part- digitally)  from one side to the other. It's very cool and is an example of one way  the Hugheses keep the focus away from the plot's shaky skeleton. I only  have beef with their excessive slow-motion walking-toward-the-camera  shots and showing a bit too much of the cloudy green-gray sky. 
Some people are going to be more surprised and impressed with the  film's big reveal than others, but anyone with a love of action and  that post-apocalyptic context will find something to make "Eli" a  worthwhile watch regardless of plot weakness. Washington is slightly  under-utilized but he's an ideal fit. He brings an intensity in his  demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a  good job of making his character more central than anything else.

I am always hesitant when movies come out in January or February. The Oscar buzz is about last year's performances and the summer blockbusters are still five months away. So, when movies come out this time of the year there is a distinct possibility that the movie is going to have a weak story line and sub par acting. This is not the case with "The Book of Eli." For a January movie  it exceeded my expectations.

I have respect for both Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman and their choice of past roles. Gary's role in this film was that of the old bad guy running a small western front town 30 years after a nuclear war (I am assuming it was nuclear war, they only vaguely described what happened). He sends his traveling bandits out of town to find the last Bible on earth. He does this because with the last Bible on earth he can reestablish civilization under his reign. It does seem far-fetched but then again it is a January movie so I will cut it some slack. Gary did a great job, reminded me a little of his bad guy character in "The Professional," but he wasn't over the top with his acting, only when he needed to be.

On to Denzel, who did another great job. He reminded me of Clint Eastwood in his western movies where he didn't say much because he didn't have to. Denzel's actions spoke for him. That leads us into the action sequences. The Hughes Brothers delivered the action with a wallop and without a lot of blood and guts. The first fight scene looked like five silhouettes fighting a shadow of a man. There's also a shoot out scene where they used some pretty innovative camera shots to put the viewer into the action. The action was quick and to the point and just as important, it was memorable.

We covered the actors and the action, so what about the story? The story could have taken place in the Old West just as it could have taken place in an apocalyptic future. It was simple and didn't have many confusing elements to it. The premise was to get that Bible. Denzel's job was to head west to deliver the last copy of the Bible to someone. He does everything in his power to protect the book. Since the Bible is the main focus of the hunt there are some religious overtones but nothing too heavy. There is also a good use of humor, something totally unexpected considering the drabness of the film.

The camera helped in telling much of the story. Through much of the movie the camera and landscape was all that was needed to carry key elements in the story. In one scene Mila Kunis' character was attacked and instead of talking about it afterward, the camera took time to focus on her reaction to the situation. There are also several shots of Denzel walking in the desolation showing the audience the ruined landscape. Dialogue couldn't have added much more.

Should you see this movie? Yes. Even though it won't get Oscar nods or be the next big summer blockbuster, it will still keep most people entertained. The ending might make you want to see it a second time to see what you missed the first time. All I am saying is keep your eyes open.

Well, I went to see this film last night not knowing much about the actual plot of it. The start was promising, with some great fight scenes and on the whole, it was well filmed with some great cinematography. Washington played his role well, as did Oldman as Carnegie, however Mila Kunis who anyone who watches 'Family Guy' could tell was the voice of Meg Griffin wasn't good at all. The fact she is the voice of Meg also made me unable to take her seriously, but thats probably just me. I enjoyed the film at the start up until it becomes apparent that 'the book' is in fact the Bible. The fact that the whole film was based around this alienated a lot of people who may be atheist or even if they were Christian, as it was completely hypocritical that Eli killed maybe 100s of people in order to keep the book. Is this in-keeping with Christianity? Well, now the ending. It just about had it for me when we found out that Eli was blind. This put the great fighting scenes that i mentioned earlier in a poorer light for me, as we realised he was supposed to be fighting several people single handedly whilst blind?? Completely ridiculous. as was the fact that he was shot in the stomach, and then 5 minutes later back on the road with some duck tape over the wound. On the whole, its maybe worth seeing if you don't mind contradictory and frankly ridiculous plot twists, hearing Meg Griffin's voice throughout a supposedly tense and serious film and of course, if you don't mind killing 100s of people for the possession of a Bible written in braille.

You might be jaded already with a number of big budgeted science fiction films that are set after some apocalyptic disaster that wiped out most of humankind, and having the protagonist become some sole, lonely survivor up against others who have banded together for worse, and without law and order and faced with severely limited resources to survive, cannibalism in a wild wild west environment becomes the order of the day, with those having weapons commanding over those who don't, and a clean bed, warm food, women and clean water are precious, tradable commodities.

I assure you that The Book of Eli, despite what so many others have said, remain refreshing, with Denzel Washington in a charismatic starring role opposite Gary Oldman back to his villainous best, both being top draws in the film. Written by Gary Whitta who had fused key religious elements into science fiction, his effort triumphs against recent others such as Legion, and gets a better execution by the Hughes Brothers Albert and Allen who are sorely missed since their last film From Hell some 9 years ago, a film I enjoyed (despite the butchery here), bringing back their signature way of telling a tale through dark, brooding atmospheres. The first few minutes of the film which introduces Washington's Eli, is nothing short of brilliance relying solely on his enigmatic, silent presence, clearly surpassing that of Will Smith's turn in I Am Legend.

Washington's Eli is what carries the film, a man fixated in his sole mission for some 30 years already, doing so based on one word - faith and a vision and instruction given unto him. He's the modern day missionary, executing his god-given task without question, believing that he fulfills his calling with as little fuss as possible. He truly believes that he's being protected from harm, and of course that also meant through the use of a shotgun, pistol and one hack of a machete (pardon the pun and intentional misspelling), dispatching bandits like spreading butter on warm toast. As such he's indestructible almost, giving himself some reputation into a small town he wanders into, especially when he has in him a possession of the titular book that seems to hold the hope to mankind's salvation.

And Gary Oldman's Carnegie is the anti-thesis to Eli the messenger. For Carnegie, possession of the book is key for his power consolidation, because being able to influence the weak, the desperate and those in despair, would translate to loyal obedience. And in some ways this is quite true, in the way the power and influence religion has over the masses. In fact, Carnegie's explanation to Eli on the need for the book, is something which you'll find hard to dispute about, because even if one aspires to be a false prophet, one will require firstly the scriptures from which to twist from, since groping verses from the air just doesn't cut it even to the simple minded.

As seen in films like There Will Be Blood, false prophets are abound, and this is one of the stronger aspects of the film blatantly made so explicit. You cannot help but to think about the same concept in today's context, where one's perceived knowledge and ability would bring about tremendous power and followers because of the seeding of hope and salvation in one's mind, and top marks given if one can influentially enslave the mindsets of desperate others through faith, something which Eli also has problems trying to explain to his new follower of sorts, Solara (Mila Kunis).

For action junkies, you'll not be left out by the handful of battle sequences, where the hand to hand combat scenes have Washington showing off what he had learnt from a student of Bruce Lee, and reportedly doing so without the use of a stunt double. And if slicing and dicing opponents in close quarter combat is not your cup of team, there are also those which are laden with gun fights that just rip everything apart in their way, although I prefer the more elegant alternative of the use of the bow and arrows, with the Hughes Brothers knowing a thing or two about shooting proper action sequences that you can actually follow comfortably.

Testosterone-laden action aside, In some ways the film also touches upon the importance of culture, without which we're reduced to nothing but savages, knowledge being buried in books and encyclopedias that no longer exist save for those still in collective memory. The final act, together with its sucker punch makes it all the more satisfying and poignant even, giving you compelling reason to want to watch this a second time with that little bit of background knowledge to observe performance and nuances that had probably gone unnoticed. That said, there are still a minor loophole here and there, but as Eli puts it, it's accredited to nothing more than faith. Highly recommended!

Well, I love apocalyptic movies, because the possibilities to make a good movie are endless. Add to that a "lone wolf" character roaming the wasteland, and things can get even better. 

But, what can we do when these Hollywood geniuses decide to dumb down the story to such a low level? 

First of all, the Bible is one of the most printed books of human history one can find a copy of it anywhere. If one can find a shotgun and shells, rockets, ray-ban sunglasses, and other things shown in the movie, I am sure that it would be very easy to find a copy of a Bible. OK, maybe the film was an allegory. But still this is plain stupid.

Second, how a Bible would help humans in a post-apocalyptic world? People will need books on agriculture, medicine, metallurgy, etc... It is idiotic to think that all humans need is religion to straighten things out. 

Third, with a name like that "Eli" one can guess which is the secret book in the first 30 seconds of the movie...

Fourth, since the book is the Bible how come our "hero", the harbinger of the sacred word, is willing to kill for it? Don't those guys ever learn? What about that message of brotherly love, turn the other face, etc, etc, etc... Only a few chose are deserving of salvation? Come on...

The only positive thing in the movie is that the "Book of Eli" was not the Quran. In these politically correct times we do not know what to expect any more....

The first thing that strikes you about this film is how horrid and beautiful it looks all at the same time. We are in a post-apocalyptic world of washed out colours, destroyed structures and dying people scrabbling to make sure they are not the next to die; and it is a world that is really well designed and really well filmed by Don Burgess. Everything looks convincing and it doesn't feel like they just shot it out in a desert location, it genuinely feels like a scorched earth. The only slight irritant about the look of the film is that it does feel very much like a great copy of the world of Fallout 3 as created by Bethseda  right down to the design of the "bandits" with their goggles and ragged clothing; this bugged me and those very familiar with this world via gaming may also feel the film is "borrowing" rather than creating.

I talk about the look and style of the film first because to me it is really one of the main reasons to watch this film and indeed for the first 20 minutes or so, it is all we are drifting on  this sense of the cool and the barren without much in the way of who's or why's. Unfortunately when the plot does start to come in, it does so with a terribly corny story and message that wouldn't be out of place in one of those overly-earnest low-budget films made by Christian companies. Indeed this is what this film is  an overly earnest religious film, it just happens to have cost millions and have massive Hollywood stars involved in it. Now, this is the point where you assume that I dislike the film because it is to do with God and the bible, but this wasn't it all at  it didn't help for sure, but this isn't the reason.

The main problem I have is that the film doesn't actually seem interested in making this message work and the plot just seems like a necessary evil to get the character walking in slow-mo around this cool landscape. There isn't much development beyond the basic dialogue about the power of this book and it is nothing but endless corn in the main; I may have respected it more if it had done something with the content, but it doesn't, indeed it seems almost embarrassed by it. The Hughes Brothers for sure aren't particularly interested in that and thus the performances and shots are all about the style, the atmosphere and the look of the film. Accordingly the cast do the same  which is fine because I wonder why they were all queuing up to be in this story. Washington is a great lead because he is all style and presence and he fits the landscape well. Kunis' character makes less sense as she goes on but she is stunning to look at and again fits the style aspect of the film. Oldman's villain is poor and as a result he is only OK.

What all this leaves then is a film that should be watched by fans of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, simply because it is a great film recreation of those worlds, from the colour of the sky down to the costumes it feels and looks like the games. Outside of this though, the casual viewer is left with very little of interest going on behind the style; the story is cloyingly religious and lacking any insight or intelligence  in terms of writing it feels like having two guys at your door trying to sell Jesus to you with platitudes and clichés. It all looks fantastic but unfortunately the script simply doesn't deserve the visuals.

This 'movie' left me feeling slightly used - by Denzel Washington. It's a bit like battlefield earth, but with God instead of thetans, and Gary Oldman instead of John Travolta (the parallel is fairly loose really, but i think it stands). I'm really not happy being preached to by movies, especially those whose central character fails to live up to anything he tells other people (how Christian is it to cut another mans hand off?). If you're a Christian, don't go to see this movie - it's violent (this violence is seemingly OK, as long as it's a good guy killing people in the name of God, rather than the bad guys killing people - which I find to be a rather worrying message). If you're not a Christian, don't go and see this movie, unless you like being preached to. Go and watch The Road. It's much better.

It started off with such promise, the fight scenes were excellent .... But then the horrible truth dawned on us that the book was the Bible , bearing in mind that the war which destroyed the world was a religious one ! After this point the Movie began to get more and more far fetched and funny "30 years to get to the Midwest ?" then when we realised he was blind ! we couldn't help but laugh :) this how ever explained some things like backing into the shadows to even the fight (not sure how he knew there were shadows there though.) Killing a Cat with a bow and arrow while lying down and erm BLIND ! Shot in the stomach with a 9mm hand gun,then back pack on and off down the road we go?! The end creased us up too, after dictating the entire bible, they reprinted and bound it and placed it in between the Quran and the Torah ! I think the irony was lost on them.

This movie explains that the Earth was destroyed because of wars of religion and that therefore the survivors destroyed every religious books to prevent from repeating the same disaster. And yet, one man  Eli played by Denzel Washington  who's supposed to be a good man, a wise man chooses to preserve one of these religious books which was partly responsible for almost destroying the Earth!! What's the idea? He expects this time the job will be done correctly and Earth and mankind will be destroyed completely? The Hughes brothers are trying to say that religions are a good thing that can be bad if used by the wrong people (Gary Oldman's character). Which is a stupid message. The good question is: do we need religion to live together? The answer is no because as soon as someone has one religion he rejects anyone having another religion (or no religion at all). Religious tolerance is a myth, it does not exist. Man has invented something better than religions to live together, it's called Laic Democracy. One more thing, Eli hears voices (like Joan of Arc) telling him what to do and the Hughes brothers, who obviously believe in God, implicitly assert that God exists by this subterfuge (since "He speaks to Eli"). Didn't the Hughes brothers ever heard of medical science? Someone who hears voices from God (or anyone else) is not a Saint it's someone who suffers from schizophrenia (a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder). By the way, religions do exist, it's a fact. And God does not exist, it's a fact.

SPOILER(S) BELOW! The Book of Eli is basically a Christian propaganda film dressed up as some sort of action flick: For the first 30 minutes or so they do a mediocre job of masking the fact that he's carrying nothing but a bible with gore and gritty action, but then it becomes very obvious what the movie is about once he reveals himself as a devout Christian quoting passages incessantly and enforcing Christian manners.

Once it sheds it's action guise, the film basically devolves into some horrible Christian martyrdom flick, where acts of faith go unchallenged, people are stupid animals without Christian mores and bad guys lose.

The acting is good, but not very memorable; both Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington perform their roles adequately.

So why did I give it 1/10? It's a religious propaganda movie.

Considered for me so far out of the twelve films I have seen at the cinema in 2010. The Book of Eli is the worst and probably will remain that for the rest of the year. I was looking forward to this movie but it was a pile of rubbish.

Denzel Washington (at his worst) plays the character of Eli who travels across post-apocalyptic America (which is desolate) blind whilst carrying a bible, which he quotes out of. He has astonishing fighting skills with guns, swords and hand to hand combat. He comes across Gary Oldman (who acts just as bad) who plays the principal villain Carnegie. He wants Eli's book as he believes it will help him control the world. At the same time a young woman Solara played by the pretty Mila Kunis who is being terrorised by Carnegie joins Eli.

This movie is crap, the plot is ridiculous with gaping plot holes like we don't find out why America's become a desolate wasteland and there is no back story to Eli's life, which makes him an uninteresting character. Eli talks sanctimonious babble about religion and preserving life, which he dosen't do. In one scene he lets an elderly couple get raped and beaten to death and says to himself he can't help them as he "has to complete his mission" He's meant to be the hero but I didn't like him. He also goes over the top in killing people like one scene in a bar he pushed a man's cat off the bar counter and then when the guy and his friends start on him he slices them to pieces. How pathetic. The action was not exciting as it happens too fast.

The ending as well was completely implausible though I like what happens to Eli as he actually dies! The only things I liked about this film was a cameo from an odd old couple the man played by Micheal Gambon and whose time in the film was unfortunately too brief was entertaining and Mila Kunis was pretty and had some redeeming acting quality, but even that couldn't save this movie. It's one great big turkey.

This is the type of movies that make you want to cry for spending the time watching and for feeling sorry for yourself that had to endure this monstrosity; the type of movie that indeed turns to you God, finding yourself praying that it won't happen again to have to suffer through this kind of visual and aesthetic abuse. While it starts in an engaging, atmospheric direction of a post-apocalyptic world, hoping it is as good as the original Mad Max that started it all, as the plot unveils the idiocy is gradually revealed. Why is this book so important? it's the last Bible! So for once humanity is close to eliminating this violent, incoherent, contradicting, third-rate philosophy, for the right reasons I may add, and this idiot goes to the greatest lengths to save it. Personally, I would find a cook book far more interesting. While the villain Gary Oldman wants the book to use it the good old fashion way (spiritually enslave people and turn them to his followers), the "good" guy wants to save it at all costs. Apparently, so that other people can do the same. In the end, Denzel Washington turns out to be a blind man (obviously, God was being his eyes while he was fighting the largest part of the remaining humanity). My prayers that the female protagonist would lose her top or that Washington would finally be killed by Gary Oldman or something interesting would happen did not work.

Few things are hotter this winter than Mila Kunis walking around a post-apocalyptic town in a pair of Aviators. That and a quiet Denzel Washington wielding a sword sets up The Book of Eli, yet another post-apocalyptic thriller set in the future (or lack thereof). The post-apocalypse film may be getting old after films like Children of Men, The Road, I Am Legend, etc., but The Book of Eli manages to keep itself away from the cliché apocalypse film.

Denzel portrays the title character of Eli, a mysterious man who walks around around a destroyed world carrying a book he believes can save humanity. He wanders into a makeshift town where a sadistic villain (Gary Oldman) desperately wants the book. Enter some hacked limbs, explosions, and cannibals, and you got yourself an interesting film.

This is a different role for Denzel. Usually, he's just the calm talker who tries to make sure the bad guys don't do anything crazy (think Inside Man and last summer's remake of The Taking of Pelham 123). However, not only does Denzel do a lot of talking, but he's cutting off people's arms and shooting up the place like he's Jason Statham. One memorable scene involves Eli killing Oldman's men-who are armed with sniper rifles AB machine guns-with a simple handgun.

It's also very refreshing to see Gary Oldman return to the role of a villain. Younger audiences now see Oldman as a good guy after portraying famous literary protagonists such as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films and Jim Gordon in the recent Batman series. While there's nothing at all wrong with that, I was starting to miss Oldman's villain days, including classic turns as a drug addicted cop in Leon The Professional and a Russian terrorist in Air Force One. Oldman shows his versatility in Eli, where he makes his character a complete psycho.

When I first saw that Kunis was cast in this film, I was a little worried. Sure, everybody loves Mila, but could the star of comedies like That 70's Show and Forgetting Sarah Marshall make the transition in a serious film? Kunis plays her role well, but she should stick with the comedies until she's given a character with more to do.

The Book of Eli isn't perfect with its choppy action sequences or pacing issues, but its a fun film nonetheless. It's films like these that keep the post-apocalyptic genre alive and well.

I've always liked The Hughes Brothers. From Menace II Society to Dead Presidents to American Pimp to From Hell, they are amazing filmmakers. That said, The Book Of Eli separates itself from their other films. This is not to say this is a good thing. See, The Book Of Eli lacks what The Hughes Brothers usually have. Examples of what those are-characters, a story, a plot, good acting, good direction, entertainment value, ETC. Look, I could go on and on of how bad of a film The Book Of Eli is. From its boring, stupid, absurd set up to its final, terrible, rip off final twist, The Hughes Brothers, as much as their other films have amazed me, have made an undeniably bad film. Denzel Washington is supposed to be a bad ass at the end of the world, and Gary Oldman is supposed to be the evil gang member who wants Washington's magical book. Mila Kunis is the daughter of Oldman who follows Washington. However, the actors are so painfully dull that none of them can pull of their roles, and the roles, along with the movie becomes stupid and boring. As for the twist, even if the movie was amazing, the last 5 minute twist would have made me hate the movie anyway. Avoid this movie at all costs, and I mean all costs.

To be honest i thought i was going to enjoy this film. I was strongly wrong however. This is Washingtons worst role to date and a thorough let down on all sides technically. The Book of Eli was stupid as well as idiotic in that nothing made sense. The action, dialogue and casting was absolutely out of place and didn't serve any meaning or emotional response from me. It had this tone of being an MTV style movie that looked tacky and out place. And why did Gary Oldman want to take part in this gruelling and underly layered flop? I mean, he starred in The Dark Knight so surely seeing the quality of that compared to this he should have easily said no. But obviously not.

I am disappointed, Denzel ? This movie gets a minus 10 (what movie) Praise the lord, or Eli for that matter. Quite a shot with that bow and arrow for a blind guy. He probably thought that cat was a small deer. 30 years after what? The big boom? If there were so many humans alive what happen to the other bibles. Funny how the only one left would be in Braile, owned by a Blind guy that can shoot moving targets out of the air with a bow and arrow. And P.S. Where was the Nuclear Winter? Looking forward to a good horror flick, as obviously to me this didn't make any sense, although, I'm sure my local pasture would love this movie. Along with it's incredible miracles, I think my dog got more out of it than I did. This movie was so bad, it is hard to critique it more without becoming abusive, I would recommend it to someone who is really pressed for time, sitting there patiently in their pressed time trying to figure out what the hell this movie is about.

Amen.

This is a film that starts with one of the most strikingly beautiful scenes I've seen in a long time . Credit to the Hughes Brothers for directing it and most especially a big thank you to cinematographer Don Burgess for shooting a scene that instantly draws you in to the movie . One does feel slight apprehension that the film can't sustain this opening and you're going to be watching a film that is style over substance . Guess what ? You're going to be watching a film that is not only style over substance but is quite illogical and even insulting in its storytelling 

The film follows Eli who treks through a post apocalyptic American landscape . To compare it to MAD MAX 2 is wrong because the wonderful technical merits of the movie keep you hooked but then the film quickly and continually shoots itself in the foot by having a scenario that throws logic out the window not only after you've watched the film but while you're watching it too . It's explained there's been a war almost certainly a thermo nuclear war . It's not said when this has happened but characters in their late teens early twenties have no knowledge of life before this war . So now people are reduced to cannibalism and yet 20 years after this holocaust people have access to petrol to drive vehicles ! I know Americans love their cars but this is too much to believe . The film contains several instances of this lack of thought going in to the screenplay 

The plot revolves bad guy Gary Oldman trying to get his hands on " a book for the weak and desperate " so you're able to guess it's not written by Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens . This also leads to another lapse in logic . Are we to believe that in an evangelical protestant country like the United States no one has a Bible at hand . Indeed what makes this even more bizarre is that for some reason no one seems to have any conception of Christianity . Eli quotes the Bible to his companion Solara who is intrigued by his words . I know the God Channel won't be broadcast after world war three but isn't the whole idea of religion to appeal to people who have nothing ? You don't have to say Marx is right but the thinking behind this film is entirely wrong 

There is also something that seems to have confused the audience and that is Eli is blind . He isn't . He might carry a Bible written in braille that doesn't mean he's blind . Nowhere is it stated on screen that he is blind and in many scenes Eli looks at objects such as a man hanging from rafters or a house in the distance . There's no sound emanating from this objects and yet Eli looks straight at them . One wonders reading the trivia section if this site has been the victim of an internet hoax ? One would also like to see someone contribute to the trivia section explaining why Eli is bulletproof 

I really wanted to like this movie . As I stated it is an impressive film from a technical viewpoint but as so many films prove if you've got a bad screenplay then unfortunately great directing and camera workcant rescue a bad screenplay . Worse than that because you'll find yourself becoming frustrated at the way a film that could have been excellent ends up on your mediocre list

I'd like to make a short list of things that annoyed the living hell out of me in the film.

1) The blatant thievery from Mad Max II and Waterworld. Only one of those films is worth stealing from, and its pretty damn obvious when you do.

2) Canned goods are still edible and can be traded 30 years after they were made and have been through a nuclear war? They're hardly edible now! Also, clothes and designer shades have survived without any damage and you can look like a model from one of the higher end catalogues if you put a little effort in.

3) The world appears to be a sandy wasteland with no agriculture or industry, so what did the people eat and where did they get the cloth to make their clothes, the ammunition for their semi automatic weapons and the fuel for their still functioning motor vehicles?

4) Further to that, it is stated that not many people from before the war survived, so who taught the ones born since to drive and operate complex machinery? 

5) Books can survive war and fire and 30 years without getting scorched or even turning a bit yellow,and your Ipod will still work. Nobody has thought to plant a crop, but they have developed battery chargers.

OK, those are the most obvious flaws, but now we have to take a look at Eli himself, a character so ridiculous that its impossible to take him seriously. First up, he's bulletproof (except he isn't) and he's blind, although right up until that little bombshell is revealed he performs tasks that would be impossible for a blind man to complete. Oh, and he can stand in the middle of a firefight and not get hit once, but he can shoot down about 12 baddies with a single magazine from his pistol. Not since the A Team have the bad guys been such lousy shots. When he isn't using his pistol, he uses a big machete to hack people to death with, all in the name of the Lord. But thats OK, because the Bearded One has chosen Eli to be his last prophet, delivering his word to the poor folk of the now ravaged earth. Only he doesn't.There is absolutely no back story to Eli, we only know that he's been walking for 30 years murdering anybody he doesn't like (which is everybody)and in that time has never found people worthy of his teachings. Oh yeah, he has the only copy of the bible in the whole world. Its a King James bible obviously, because God is a W.A.S.P

We are told that after the war, the remaining citizens of planet earth spent the time that followed not rebuilding or replanting, but seeking out copies of the book and destroying them. It appears that only 10% has survived the war and subsequent scorching of the earth, but between them they managed to destroy about 5 billion copies of the gospels. they must have worked awfully hard.

So, a bullet proof blind prophet of God wanders the deserts of America for 30 years killing everybody, unless they really deserve it because they're rapists, trying to find a safe place for the holy book he has in his possession. There's a baddie after it, but he is so inept and stupid that he lets Eli keep his knife and gun when he takes him prisoner, and even sends him a young girl to keep him occupied while he's being detained, in the hope that he'll join his baddie gang. He doesn't, of course, but the girl hears a few words from the book and instantly becomes his disciple. They escape his clutches and walk out of town, hotly pursued by vehicles that he manages to outdistance by miles in about 15 minutes. 

If it sounds like I'm making this up as I go along then its because this is exactly what happened I suspect. to fill in the massive plot holes and action sequence absurdities, the writers appear to have patched the script with garbage like 'Oh, lets make him bullet proof. Thats gets him out of that one'

So onward we plod until Eli gets bested, which makes God angry and there's a big flash of lightning but no repercussions, and the baddie, played by a completely wasted Gary Oldman, gets his prize. Only he doesn't because TAADAA!! The book is in braille! Genius. Luckily Eli has memorised it and finally reaches his destination, having taped a bullet wound in his stomach up, and recites the entire thing to a man with a pen and around 10000 sheets of paper to spare before finally dying.

Now, the entire film is nothing more than a poorly realised piece of Christian propaganda, the message being that without the word of God, the world will descend into savagery. I don't really have a problem with that, films have to be about something and thats as good a premise as any other, my problem is that it is just very badly played out. I don't mind being fooled, like in The Usual Suspects, what I object too is being treated like a fool. The close up of Eli's eyes, where his blindness is revealed is supposed to be the big 'Ahhh!' moment, where everything suddenly makes sense, but it makes a nonsense of the entire film and you just wasted 2 hours being lied to by the most inept story tellers I have ever come across. It is suggested that he's only half blind, so perhaps in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king is the moral here, but even on that level it fails miserably.

Unbelievably stupid scenes added together make for quite a time waster of a movie. I too would want the world to adapt so that I can always be in danger, but in what ever situation fate has in store for me somehow come out the winner! Had this been real, Eli would have died probably 10-15 times within those two hours, which would have actually made for a lot more entertainment than the actual movie.

The only person getting anything right here is Oldman's character. He tells us viewers in no uncertain terms that it's the Bible that has created all this devastation ("That's why they burned them all after the war!") and that if only he got a hold of it and started preaching, everybody would start mindlessly gathering around him and do as he says. I have to ask... who is the bad guy here again? It certainly doesn't seem to be Oldman's character, as that guy lives in a town with rules, shops, bars and so on and seems to be an overall relatively easy guy to get along with as long as you're not acting up too much. He's even very honest, and a guy who has got the truth pretty much nailed down. And in the red corner we have Eli, a misanthropic loner who in most cases seems to be the one instigating the violence. He could have just dropped that bag as that actually pretty nice robber asked him to (to be honest, had I been the robber I would have just shot Eli as soon as he came around the corner, no need to make things more dangerous or complicated than necessary). But no, he seems to want to let Eli live, so he only asks for the bag. Eli chops the guy's hand off and kills his mates. Good job Eli! Acting like a true Christian. Besides... people with bibles are bullet proof. We all know that! But if you really take your time analysing what happens, thinking about the dialogues, you realize soon enough that the movie isn't really about the book but it's about keeping Eli alive as long as possible, saving him for the "grand" finale.

One final thought: Does this movie make sense? The bibles were burnt after the war, for good reason. If it's such a commodity after 30 years, if it's something virtually unique, there must have been good reason to destroy all the billions bibles, and as Oldman's character practically says straight out - the war was because of the message, because of the book. So why would the ending of the movie come down to the saving of the book, the reprinting of the book if it is what destroyed the world in the first place? Does this mean that Eli in reality represents Satan, working to destroy even the remainder of civilisation? A reasonable conclusion, if I may say so myself.

Right... Next!

With the recent revival of the post-apocalyptic genre in Hollywood, it would be easy to overlook this film, and that would be a mistake. Thirty years from now the world is a barren, desolate wasteland filled with the charred remains of a civilization that destroyed itself through war. In this bleak future a lone man wanders west (Denzel Washington), guided by nothing more than faith, to deliver the last remaining copy of a book that changed the world, and will do so again. While Washington seeks to deliver the book to those who would do good with it, a local warlord (Gary Oldman), an erudite student of Mussolini, wants to possess the book so he can use the words to sway the masses and become a powerful dictator. The characters are very well acted, the action is fluid and well choreographed, and the setting seeps into your skin, immersing the viewer in a world devoid of faith but in desperate need of salvation. The final plot twist is creative, unexpected, and poetically just. The Book of Eli should shoot to the top of your Netflix queue.

The whole premise of this movie is simply too ludicrous for anyone with two brain cells to rub together to believe. The Bible has been translated into 2,479 languages and has been printed literally BILLIONS of times. The Gideons alone have placed 1.3 BILLION Bibles and New Testaments in hotels across the world. There is a Bible in virtually every hotel room in America. Yet somehow we are to believe that after a nuclear war, the few remaining survivors somehow successfully harnessed what little energy and resources they had left and channeled them into destroying BILLIONS of copies of the Bible. They did this rather than, you know, say, trying to survive in the aftermath of nuclear war. Preposterous!
