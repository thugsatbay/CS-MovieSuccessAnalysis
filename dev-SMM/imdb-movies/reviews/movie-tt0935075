### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Following on from his first two audacious features in the niche of queer cinema, John Cameron Mitchell now enters relatively mainstream waters to bring us Rabbit Hole, adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play. It's a quiet, contemplative film, brimming with sadness and humor, and lead by a wonderful central performance.

Nicole Kidman returns to the theme that first brought her to international attention - that of a mother grieving the loss of a child, and the emotional aftermath that such a trauma entails. Of course in the two decades since Dead Calm was released, Kidman has explored of multitude roles and worked with some of the finest directors in the industry. She has gained such an authority on screen - yet somehow, here, she manages to strip away all of our preconceptions so that we are left with something as raw and natural as she was opposite Sam Neil at the age of 21. This is her most fully-rounded character and detailed performance in years - nimble, layered and completely magnetic.

Becca's journey with her husband Howie (Aaron Eckhart), eight months after the tragic accident that killed their son, is beautifully captured by Cameron Mitchell's lens. Despite the film's stage origins, the story never feels too talky or confined, shots are simple yet beautifully composed, the editing and pace have a fluid rhythm. The couple's facade of normalcy - making dinners, attending pious bereavement groups and keeping up appearances with friends and neighbors, begins to crack as the mementos of their son's life disappear. Becca gives his clothes to goodwill and takes his paintings off the fridge, she accidentally deletes a video of him playing on a swing - causing a distraught reaction in Howie. The difference in the way this couple deals with the loss is compelling, and the friction between them palpable outside of the few explosive scenes.

Their disconnect becomes more and more apparent, and Eckhart plays it with a wounded humanity that's really effective. Howie wishes they could "get back on track" and perhaps try for another baby, something which Becca is not prepared to do. Instead he starts hanging out with Gabby, a woman from their bereavement group, played by the always reliable Sandra Oh. Meanwhile prickly moments between Becca and her irresponsible sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) are very well played and Dianne Wiest provides a lot of warmth and wisdom as Becca's mother, but doesn't really get a defining moment. Becca both yearns to escape the reminders of her grief and seeks closure and solace in her pursuit of Jason, the young man who accidentally ran over her son. This strand of the story, exploring the idea of parallel universes and fate, gives the story a unique edge and Miles Teller is easily the stand out of the supporting cast.

Ultimately what gives this film its power is that Mitchell's focus is always fiercely rooted in the reality of the situation, side-stepping the potential sentimentality of the subject - biting humor undercuts the sorrow and there certain moments of confrontation between Becca, Howie and Jason that strike quite a visceral chord. The scenes on the bench between Kidman and Teller contain moments of such purity and depth as to be heartbreaking - and to me, the final montage is one of the most sublime and emotionally resonant endings of the past decade. I can't recommend the film enough, and if there's any justice in the world Kidman will finally be recognized again by the Academy.

A subject like this requires attention and scrupulousness and it definitely had plenty of both. Based on the book "Rabbit Hole" written by David-Lindsay Abaire, the movie is riveting as far as execution and concept. It's very well organized, it's narrative structure is impressive and it definitely catches you emotionally. The story is about a family, husband (Aaron Eckhart) and wife (Nicole Kidman), that have to deal with the emotional consequences of losing their 4 years old child. In order to free themselves they have to accept the past and move on and also to regain their trust in themselves and recommit to their marriage. The movie is getting real honest approaching the human's allowance to forgiveness when the confrontation between the "broken" family and the one responsible for that finally has place. It might appear to be a simple story but it's not thanks to the patience and passion the director, John Cameron Mitchell, invested in it. Dazzling visually and very inspiring, this movie succeeds to entertain, amaze and replenish it's audience with hope in totality.

Carried not only by it's execution but also by it's memorable Oscar-worthy performances, Rabbit Hole finds himself to be one of the best movies of 2010. Nicole Kidman as the simple Becca, offers one of her best performances in a long time. It's a simply astounding, honest and passionate performance of this weakened but reasonable and powerful woman that must be rewarded by the Academy with at least a nomination if not the award itself. Aaron Eckart does not get over-shadowed by Kidman's performance and proves once again that by portraying Becca's husband, Howie, his acting capabilities exceed our expectations. There are also notable performances by Dianne Wiest as Becca's mother and Miles Teller as the one responsible for the suffered loss.

Visually the movie finds it's own identity in the beautiful palette of colors. The cinematography it's the most you could ask for this kind of movie. There's no need for any other requirements. The most beautiful thing though it's the soundtrack which as simple as it might be... it fits the atmosphere and the story perfectly. Those violin and guitar chords, the little piano rolling in the background create a unique peaceful mood.

What I do want at the end of my review is to recommend this movie to anyone because it's simple but stunning, it's usual but complex, carried by three overwhelming performances. This is without a doubt one of the best movies released this year.

Rabbit Hole is a tragic tale that won't sadden viewers. That is simply not the purpose despite what the plot and trailer may show. Rabbit Hole is a story of how two previously happy couple cope with the loss of their four-year-old son. The what/who/where/why/how is what makes Rabbit Hole one of 2010's finest films.

Right off the bat you will notice what surrounds this couple; a world filled with joy and life at the worst moment in their lives. This feeling does not lend itself to that Oscar-feeling feel it may have wanted but it certainly works. 

These actors give highly realistic performances that fit perfectly with this demanding plot. Nicole Kidman steals the show with her best performance (and movie) since 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Aaron Eckhart also gives a terrific performance as the grieving husband and father and, after 'Love Happens', shows that he is back to serious acting as he was in 'The Dark Knight'.

The best aspect of Rabbit Hole is how you begin by knowing very little about these characters but end up knowing them as if they were your own neighbors. You progressively learn what happened to their son and other details within their past that fit perfectly together without feeling as they are giving the audience answers. The dialogue also lends itself to this method and, surprisingly, never feels directed to the audience.

What I found unique is how with such a depressing feel to the film, it never actually makes the viewer sad, but interested. It is a film that will make you laugh more than cry and I found that impressive. It isn't your normal tear-jerker; you are watching this couple live their lives and deal with this death in an interesting way. Rabbit Hole never has a dull moment; my eyes were glued to the screen from the start.

Rabbit Hole is simply one of the finest films of 2010. Its execution is sometimes brilliant and the feeling of self-awareness and thought it lends to the viewer is unlike anything you may have ever seen. It's not your run-of-the-mill Oscar contender. Rabbit Hole is a beautiful tale of life. And death.

Nicole Kidman has an outstanding resume collected in the past 25 years. The Hours, Moulin Rouge!, Eyes Wide Shut, The Interpreter, Margot at the Wedding, The Others, Birth, Dogville, Nine, Cold Mountain, the list goes on. She's proved herself to be the best working actress out there, today, but has had a bit of a rough patch since her Oscar win with many films flopping critically and or financially. "Rabbit Hole" reiterates the fact she's the best there is. 

Kidman plays Becca with intense, explosive motivation. She really gets under your skin; you see Becca, not Nicole Kidman. It really is a landmark in her career. She's bound to get a well- earned Oscar nomination and will go head-to-head with Natalie Portman for the win (Don't you wish there were more ties?) She transforms into the role and drenches it in realism. sorrow. It's beyond words can describe and mothers who've gone through such a horrible loss will thank Kidman left and right. 

The script plays a character itself. Its dark subject matter was a risky one, but it unflinchingly succeeds at all costs. It displays accurately the process of grief and does justice to the sorrowful topic. The much needed comic relief moments are in there as well, which lightens up the mood. Some dialogue will stick with you as you leave this film and will haunt you. You'll find yourself repeating what's said in the film. The direction goes hand-in-hand with the script. The delicate approach is perfectly matched. With a film like this, it could be over- the-top and obnoxious, or flat and lifeless, but the director finds just the right note and strikes it right for 90 minutes. 

Aaron Eckhart plays opposite Kidman as the husband, Howie. He is dignifying in his depiction of a grieving father in need of conquer this tragedy. Diane Weist is also a wonderful standout as Becca's mother who has also lost a child. She has her dramatic moments which are the weight of her performance, but has so much warmth to her character which really makes you care for her. 

Rabbit Hole isn't to be missed. It's a fascinating, deep, and moving film that will knock you on your feet. Kidman is terrific, but not without the support of Eckhart and Weist. The score is also brilliant and beautiful. At a nice, short running-time, Rabbit Hole will have an impact on your day.

'RABBIT HOLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) 

David Lindsay-Abaire adapts his tragic play about a couple who lose their young son in a car accident. The film is directed by actor turned director Cameron Mitchell (who also directed 'SHORTBUS' and 'HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH', in which he also played the title character). It stars Golden Globe nominee Nicole Kidman (who also produced the film) and Aaron Eckhart (who's equally impressive). The film is full of tough hard to watch drama and strikes a very realistic and believable tone. Depressing but worth the watch.

The film focuses on how each spouse copes differently with their tragedy. Becca (Kidman) wants to get rid of everything that reminds her of her son, including the dog he chased into the street the day he was struck by a car. Howie (Eckhart) wants to hold on to all the things that bring him cherished memories of his son, including videos he constantly watches and the dog (which he brings back into the home after getting into a heated argument with his wife over it). The couple's marriage nearly falls apart as each looks for comfort in different ways. Becca finds peace in an odd relationship with the teenage driver (Miles Teller) who struck their son and Howie finds happiness with others outside the home as well including a mutual friend of he and Becca's (Sandra Oh) they know from a counseling group. Dianne Wiest plays Becca's mother who also lost a son but, as Becca points out, an adult son to drugs.

The film has some dark comedic moments to lift the tension but for the most part it's a pretty hard hitting drama. The acting is all outstanding, especially the two leads, and the film is smartly written as well as nicely directed. Some might be afraid to watch it because of it's dark depressing subject matter but it does manage to find a little small ray of hope in the darkness. Of course there's no happy endings here but it has some nice commentary to deliver on life and coping with tragedy.

Rabbit Hole is a wonderful drama. I thought it might be good. I honestly didn't think that it could be that good. It's sad tale. The movie is more suitable to people who are more mature. People who have kids or who have lost someone really dear might find this one a real pleasure. Younger viewers who enjoy mostly American-pie-style movies don't find it much interesting. Everybody, who likes good dramas which are based on a tragic stories and concentrates on the relationships between characters, will fancy this film very much.

Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman are a great couple here. I clearly see why Kidman personally chose Eckhart to play his husband. They are so natural. It was pleasing to see those two together. A definite match.

I must admit, the story is quite somber, but I found myself happy after seeing it. That's probably because I was fascinated by the great performances of both lead actors. It may work for you too.

John Cameron Mitchell's piece is the most simple film of the year, yet one of the best. Please do not confuse simple with simplistic. It's a rather complex turmoil of emotions that come together to provide an intense account of a couple coping with their son's death. However it is done in such a clean and polished manner that one might wonder if the secret of success lies on the "simple" process of feeling the imagery and capturing the visual style. It's extremely effective and gives room to the actors do what they do best. Rabbit Hole is not about the loss, but how to cope with it and how hard and emotionally heavy it can be. Through day-to-day actions people try to forget, believing that the solution lies on the non-existence, but the truth is that facing reality is much more efficient. Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart prove that point by engaging the audiences in the dimension of their loss through significant and remarkable character development. This is to say that their performances are astounding, but much more important than that they don't feel like performances: they feel real. Though it may be hard to avoid getting into the field of sentimentalism, both actors manage to escape the melodrama and focus on what is real: going to work every day, cleaning the house, going to group therapy, baking, playing squash, reading In the process there is an intrinsic desire to confront the situation, but it's too hard. It becomes physically painful and intellectually devastating. Men and women are different to the extent of physical appearance since when it boils down to the bare essential, the human being just wants one thing: to cope with their existence. It's not about sex, procreating, loving it's accepting that people die.

Through a rather simple and undesirable situation, John Cameron Mitchell (who also suffered a loss that would become a part of his childhood) manages to express himself visually in such a liberating way that makes the dark humor all the more interesting. It is not by chance that the viewers are forced to face nature so many times. The characters are small compared to their environment; they wonder everyday what it's like to be a part of that almost intangible world of the absence of thought, just living. In fact, nature provides the perfect antagonist to our characters. They don't blame the kid that killed their son, but the circumstances, circumstances bigger than God, than the dimension of nature and the peacefulness that surrounds it. Rabbit Hole gains strength through the little pieces, the little moments of bondage and the little moments when people actually try to understand, when they stop to feel and let go of their anger and frustration. It's not easy to write a movie like this and it certainly isn't easy to direct it or act in it. But all the pieces come together to offer an amazing film. It's incredibly rewarding to see the fight against irony and the fight against the self while the cycle is reaching its final steps. Haunting!

Actor John Cameron Mitchell directs a wonderful film version of Pulitzer Prize winning author David Lindsay-Abaire's play which the play write adapted himself. Nicole Kidman (Becca) and her husband (Howie) have just lost their son and are trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. Slowly, the events of that terrible day are revealed and we see a family in distress. Nothing is working for Becca as she tries to come to terms with her loss. Howie remains in grief therapy after Becca bails, but neither can communicate with each other anymore. Becca finds little solace from her family and seeks out a young adult named Jason (Miles Teller) who was involved in the events that ended her sons life. Howie becomes involved with Gaby (Sandra Oh) a woman from his grief group. Both are reaching out to others due to the wall that their son's death has placed between them. In the end they are able to work through the wall and provide that healing touch that can only exist in their own relationship.

This is certainly a Kidman tour-de-force, she produces and acts here for the first time in tandem. She hand picked Eckhart for his role, and from the dynamics of the two actors working together; made an inspired choice. Dianne Wiest as Becca's mother "Nat" was convincing as the, perhaps, not intellectual, but worldly sage who guides the hero (Becca) toward finding the answers she needs to heal both her life and her family. Sandra Oh delivers her usual spot on performance and new comer Teller is competent, but perhaps a bit lost in such a stellar cast as this. Nevertheless, this is a fine production and a deep film. The subject matter is far too deep for teenage date night, and perhaps too frightening for young couples. Individuals, like myself, who have lost a child of their own will appreciate it; as will others who know the healing process is complicated but can be achieved with hope and patience. Excellent film...

I found out about this movie only when Nicole Kidman received awards nominations for her performance. When I found out that its sad story is about a mother who lost her son, I felt I did not want to watch another one of these somber family dramas. However, today I had a little window of time, and this film was only an hour and a half long, so I finally relented and gave it a chance.

"Rabbit Hole" tells about how a modern young couple, Becca and Howie, was dealing with the death of their very young son, about eight months after the boy got accidentally run over by a car. The drama intensifies as Becca's immature younger sister gets pregnant and healing wounds are disturbed again. What's more, Becca strikes an awkward "friendship" with the teenager who drove the car that killed her son.

Nicole Kidman is getting all the acting notices as Becca. Not meaning to put her down, Nicole was very good, but I felt that this performance was already very familiar. I felt that Aaron Eckhart did even better to essay his role as the bereaved father Howie. I think there is a bigger challenge for a male to connect and project the proper emotion in stories like this, and Eckhart delivers. I do not know how she does it, but Ms. Dianne Wiest never fails to exude warmth in her roles. Here she plays Becca's mom who also lost a son, albeit already 30 year old. She is luminescent in her few scenes, best of which was the one in the bowling alley and another one in the basement.

To its credit, the screenplay was compelling despite the subject matter. The gamut of emotions as could be expected from a situation like this were all there, from grief and anger, to frustration and cynicism. There were some moments of humor in it as well to lighten the mood a bit, especially scenes with Sandra Oh as a woman already eight years in group therapy. Contrary to my initial impressions, it did not feel boring at all. But again, the sad depressing topic may not really make it so popular for the general public.

Recently I saw Rabbit Hole, a drama that centers on a married couple that includes Becca (Played by Nicole Kidman), and Howie (Played by Aaron Eckhart), who are going through a tough time. It's been eight months since their child, Danny, was unexpectedly killed after he was hit by a car. They also go through tough times with Becca's family, a young boy she begins having conversations with, and a veteran of their support group (Played by Sandra Oh).

The film is not always highly ambitious, but it's a slow burning, devastating experience. The film is written by David Lindsay-Abbaire, and based on his stage play. He writes the film with a realistic touch, and words it oh so finely. Themes of emotional hardships, and desire to block out the past are very much so explored within the film. Still, as thoughtful as the writing and direction may be, the film can't help but feel stagy at points, and a tad distracted.

Regardless, I recommend seeing it, if only to behold the performances of Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Their performances are brimming with heart, and they infuse genuine heartbreak, anger, and joy (What little there is) into their performances. They give us gripping and memorable portrayals of sorrow and regret.

Sure, I'm not too fond of a few things, but I still liked Rabbit Hole. I give it *** out of ****

Nicole Kidman back in form with this funny and deeply moving tale about grief. The unusual side of the story is the palpable love between the married couple facing a devastating loss. They may live it in different ways but the love is the anchor and that in itself puts the film in a category all its own. Kidman and Eckhart are superb an so is the supporting cast, specially Dianne Weist, Tammy Blanchard and Miles Teller as the sort of character that we've never seen before on the screen. Not quite like this anyway. Their first meeting - Kidman and Teller - is one of my favorite film moments of the year. Cameron Mitchell, the director leaps into the main stream after "Hedwig" and "Shortbus" keeping an enthralling sense of integrity. Bravo!

'Rabbit Hole' is a nice tidy showcase for the acting talents of an above average cast, but the story doesn't have much of an arc, and neither do any of the characters. Prosperous middle-class Becca and Howie have lost their four-year-old son in a car accident eight months prior to the film's opening. Howie is struggling to move on from their loss, but Becca tries to deal with the situation by suppressing her feelings. She rejects her husband's overtures for mutual consolation, treats friends and family with icy politeness when she's not snapping at them, and tries to banish memories of her deceased son by disposing of his possessions. The couple interact joylessly with their acquaintances and each other as they struggle with the burden of grief, even as their differing responses to the tragedy widens the breach in their relationship. Director Mitchell extracts respectable performances from the actors playing the six principal characters - Aaron Eckhart in particular - but he misses several opportunities to give his characters sympathetic nuances that would have resulted in deeper emotional impact. Unfortunately, in the final analysis the film doesn't amount to much more than a superior Sunday Night TV-movie weepie for some bourgeois intelligentsia demographic.

Rabbit Hole absolutely moved me. They don't make emotionally charged films like this anymore so I was delighted when I discovered it. And as someone who as experienced loss similar to the one in the film, I completely related to both Kidman and Eckhart's characters Becca and Howie. Even though the two characters reacted to loss differently, while watching them I thought "I've been in both places". 

I was so impressed with Nicole Kidman and her ability to give such beautiful, understated yet fierce performance. She completely consumed her character which is such a treat to watch. We see the film through her eyes mostly. A woman who can't leave her house but at the same time trying to erase any memory of her past in the house. I completely connected to this woman. 

It may seem strange to say but Becca is very funny at times. The way she snaps at her overbearing mother is sprinkled with humor. And when we lose someone, it isn't all "doom and gloom" so I really enjoyed the humorous moments. Aaron Eckhart was also on top of his game, this is a side of him I've never seen before in his other films: sensitive and emotionally open. Of course Dianne Wiest is great as usual!

I can't think of any other film that has shown loss and grief in such a realistic and true way. Maybe Ordinary People, but this film is quieter, less showy. It really touched me. I laughed, I cried and I reflected on my own life. I hope everyone that has lost someone close to them sees this film because I know it will help them in some way. To see "myself" up there on the screen made me feel like I wasn't alone. Rabbit Hole is an uplifting piece of art. It'll truly give you hope.

David LindseyAbaire as screenwriter for this film, based on his own play, really gets into the head and the emotions of two grieving parents 8 months after the death of their five year old son who died running after his beloved dog. We never meet Danny and barely see a picture of him but we come to clearly understand the relentless pain in all it's forms which his parents Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are feeling. Each of them are grieving in his and her own way which despite sharing this most personal tragedy and a good previous relationship, there seems to be no room for empathy between them. Becca's quest to find some way to deal with her deep dark feelings leads her to establish a relationship with Jason (Miles Teller), the 18 year old high school senior who swerved his car, which he confesses to her may have been going a mile or two over the speed limit, which led to the tragedy and now has created a bond between them. Becca's somewhat religious mother (Diane Wiest) whose son died at age 31, eleven years previously, provides a counterpoint from where she is coming. Nicole Kidman who saw the original play and started the ball rolling to make it into a movie chose John Cameron Mitchell to direct it. Mitchell and Lindsey Abaire who were guests at our screening acknowledged that they complemented each other as they explored the fine points of this film. The director, who had only a 4 million dollar budget, shared with us that he let the actors steep themselves into their emotional roles which he appeared to nimbly direct as well as spending a great deal of time in editing the fine points. He gave a touch of humor to a primarily a dark movie and kept us the audience observing at a slight distance from the unimaginable tragedy. We did not shed a tear for the young boy who we did not meet or really know. As mental health professionals who have worked with many grieving patients, we had the feeling that we were empathizing with people we cared about, as we might with a patient who is involved in their own dynamics that are unfolding before us at somewhat rapid pace. The fact that the writer, director and the actors really nailed the complicated feelings and interactions without ripping apart the guts of the audience (which they could have easily done) may be judged a shortcoming of the movie by some or the height of sophistication by others.

This movie also merits comparison with four other movies which we have seen in the past year and each of which shows attempts at dealing with grief in a different manner. A Single Man shows Colin Firth in an Oscar nominated performance as George a college professor whose lover has died in an auto accident and in his grief he is on the verge of suicide when he meets a young student who cares about him. Robin Williams does an excellent job as an unsuccessful writer in World's Greatest Dad grieving a teenage son who committed suicide. The father pretends his late son has written the story of being bullied and the result is a game changer for the community and for the dad which gives some meaning to this tragic loss. The Lovely Bones deals with the murder of a young teenager (Saoirse Ronan) who had just begun to feel the glimmers of romance which leads the audience to feel her parent's unresolved grief despite the youngsters ethereal existence. There is a small amount of compensation as the killer is caught through the efforts of the girl's sister. The film, which most closely resembles the Rabbit Hole, is The Greatest which brought together a comparable great performance by Pierce Brosman and Susan Sarandon who are the grieving parents of a teenager killed in car accident while he is with his girl friend played by Carey Mulligan. The potential for the parents to live with their grief is the unborn child being carried by the young girl friend whereas in the film which we reviewed today, the hope for a better future is only hinted by a subtle but important gesture at it's conclusion. We thought these two were both excellent films The Greatest didn't achieve the critic's Oscar acclaim and it appears that the Rabbit Hole may get some such bids. However overall, we rated the Rabbit Hole a notch lower. We certainly do believe that this movie is the finest example and should be used as a teaching tool and stimulus for discussion for those who are studying the grieving process as well as a movie worth seeing for anyone interested in these all too real human emotions.FilmRap.net

"Rabbit Hole" stars Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart as a married suburban couple. As with all married suburban couples, there is more going on beneath the surface. Here, though, what's beneath the surface are insightful concepts, instead of additional plot lines. Becca and Howie are trying to find solace after their young son dies.

This is an extremely well written film with smart, quick and funny dialogue, and intelligent subtexts to how and where to find solace. The brilliance of the writing allows these profundities to become the main reflection, rather than just their relationship. It's also a spectacularly acted and beautifully shot film; put together in a way that it wasn't obvious that it was based on a play.

Similar to "Revolutionary Road"(2008) but set in modern times. Not very similar to John Cameron Mitchell's previous films ("Shortbus"(2006) and "Hedwig and the Angry Inch"(2001)), but shares the same intelligence just finally more accessible. 

David Lindsay-Abaire's screenplay rivals Aaron Sorkin's "The Social Network" for Best Adapted Screenplay of the year. Unfortunately, like "Doubt"(2008), which is also based on a play with a multi-layered story, lost to "Slumdog Millionaire"the more popular film of its year, so will "Rabbit Hole".

'Rabbit Hole' is a modern day drama about how people cope with death. In particular, this film is about how two well-adjusted parents deal with the untimely death of their son. Uplifting, I know. That may sound like an unenjoyable premise, but 'Rabbit Hole' delivers a subtle but delightful punch that will leave you smiling. This movie, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play, is absolutely worth seeing.

From the get go we learn that the stakes are high. The main characters, Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart), are unable to deal with the loss of their son. At a support group of similarly suffering parents we see that, as one may expect, everyone's state of mind and well being is constantly in flux. Even more, the very relationships holding these couples together is tearing at the seams. The mood is subtle and sad, but interspersed with melancholy snapshots of everyday life. I cared about these people because they are unique, they have incredible challenges to overcome, and they have imperfections they must deal with.

As the story unfolds we witness Becca and Howie's fruitless attempts to cope with the grief while slowly glimpsing the details of their son's death. Becca's family is supportive, however that doesn't prevent a number of confrontations when the topic of the accident comes up. Her mother (Dianne Wiest), wants nothing but to help but only ends up provoking Becca. These tension relieving arguments are both painful and believable. While Becca and Howie seek out their own individual outlets to get over their loss, they remain loosely coupled in what appears to be a now loveless marriage. It is what they find on their own that ultimately results in a wonderful final scene that is captivating, sad, and uplifting all at once.

I laughed at some of the atheistic remarks that Becca makes, most of which were biting and inappropriate. It closely mirrors my internal though process, words which I think but would never say. But Becca has no reason to hold things back. She's dealing with the death of her only son. This results in Becca putting those around her in unfair and difficult situations.

I also really enjoyed one of the group therapy scenes. Howie and another mother Gaby (Sandrah Oh) decide to get high in the parking lot before the meeting. The two stoned sufferers then laugh inappropriately when a couple talks about the death of their daughter. It was absolutely inappropriate, but their marijuana induced haze let them rise above the anguish of their children's deaths despite suffering that very same experience.

Nicole Kidman really shines in this movie. She has several awkward moments that are pitch perfect and entirely realistic. It's easy to identify with this character as we've all had such clumsy social encounters, however hers occur much more frequently as the result of the constant dwelling on the death of her son. Aaron Eckhart and Dianne West also shine in their performances, although Eckhart could at times be accused of being too subdued. West is rumored to be in the running for Supporting nominees. However, Miles Teller, a fairly unknown young actor who portrays Jason, the driver of the car in the accident, is perfectly cast. He's genuine and reserved and is completely captivating. His self made comic book, an artistic outlet to escape the death he caused, gives the movie it's namesake. It is the often unplanned meetings in which Jason and Becca speak about their shared misery that are the highlights of 'Rabbit Hole'.

As I hinted at earlier, 'Rabbit Hole' is very well written. The music accompanies the mood perfectly, primarily featuring a piano that slowly creeps in and out. And although it is very well shot, cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco takes no artistic risks beyond capturing the story on screen. I'm really happy to see director John Cameron Mitchell take a step back from his otherwise risqué films. If this is the sort of drama he is capable of directing then I am excited to see what he'll do next.

I think this movie may never reach a critical audience because of its somber subject. That's unfortunate, because this sort of writing, acting, and story deserves to be both told and seen. 'Rabbit Hole' is truly unique in that it focuses squarely on people overcoming sadness and coping with pain in a very realistic human way. It tackles this somber subject with a refreshing sense of grace, humor, and relief.

RABBIT HOLE (2010) *** Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckart, Dianne Wiest, Miles Teller, Tammy Blanchard, Sandra Oh, Giancarlo Esposito, Jon Tenney, Patricia Kalember. Kidman and Eckart excel as recently grieving parents over the loss of their beloved child in an accident and the broken pieces of their relationship rests on tenderhooks as the couple attempt to go on living their lives in spite of the tremendous hole in their lives with equal bits of bitterness, resentment, sorrow and ultimately hope. John Cameron Mitchell does a fine job keeping the pace and tone evenly to David Lindsay-Abaire's screen adaptation of his play with a blend of drama, comedy and tragedy that is leads handle with aplomb and a superb supporting cast including Wiest as Kidman's mother who knows only all-too well the deep pains she is dealing with and newcomer (and John Cusack look-alike) Teller as another key ingredient to the unfolding storyline (he also provides the film's double-meaning title with a graphic novel he is working on). For anyone who has ever grieved and finding it difficult to make any sense of a severe loss it is a must-see.

John Cameron Mitchell's film version of David Lindsay-Abaire's award winning film is the very definition of Oscar Bait. It's a film that was designed to get Nicole Kidman another Oscar.

The film follows a couple in the wake of the death of their four year old son. She is trying to cope by erasing any trace of him. He's fumbling about just trying to connect with his wife who seems to be a stranger. Complications arise as her sister reveals that she is pregnant. She also begins a relationship with the young man who killed her son.

Strong on performances the film doesn't have much beyond that. Director John Cameron Mitchell's direction is workman like but isn't all that creative. the film feels like any number of small budget independent films. While this isn't surprising considering that Mitchell turned out two good small films (Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Shortbus) previously. Unfortunately while those films, like this one were good, there was nothing to set them apart from any other independent film except perhaps the subject matter or stars.

This isn't a bad film, but its very much like any number of other better films and other than the big stars and Oscar push this film would rightly fall into the cracks. I'm guessing that once award season is over this film will quickly disappear, especially if it doesn't win any Oscars.

Worth a look, but not something you need run out to see.

What can I say; I actually signed up to IMDb just to warn people about this film.

With all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to going to see this film. I couldn't have been more disappointed.

Slow, devoid of plot, and without any real substance, this film is absolute drivel. It attempts to play on the heart strings, but had nothing to to so with. There's an attempt at emotion, but it never arises.

If you want to see, yet another, movie of Nicole Kidman playing the part of a woman who can only look sad (since Cruise, that's all she can do) then go and see it.

As for me; those are minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Even my fiancée was bored, and glad when we were finally released from this empty experience.

I have no doubt that the worst thing that can happen to someone is the loss of their child. It's also not a subject that will get people flooding to the cinema simply because of how grim that world can be but if you don't see this film you will be making a big mistake. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as a grieving mother as are the rest of the cast , Aaron eckhart , Dianne Wiest and Miles Teller. This is a very emotional movie and you cant helped but be moved by what happens in Becca & Howie's world and the way their relationship unfolds after the death of their son. Its both fascinating and strangely therapeutic. Why this was not up for an Oscar is beyond me , perhaps the subject was just too much for some people. Highly recommended.

A little Oscar baity - you just know Nicole Kidman purchased the rights to the play because she knew it would get her an Oscar nomination - but it is undeniably moving. Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play two grieving parents who lost their son to an auto accident eight months before the film opens. The two deal with their grief in different ways, and it's beginning to tear their relationship apart. Dianne Wiest plays Kidman's less sophisticated mother (she seems to be more from a blue collar background, which Kidman seems to have left behind), who also lost her son, albeit to heroin addiction when he was 30 (Kidman despises when her mother compares the two losses). Tammy Blanchard plays Kidman's younger sister, who tells her near the open of the film that she is pregnant. Sandra Oh plays another grieving parent, with whom Eckhart connects. The last major role belongs to Miles Teller, who plays the teen who hit the couple's son. Kidman surprisingly connects with the boy (at first I thought that he just reminded her of her dead son, which I believe was an intentional mislead). All the actors are excellent. Yeah, Kidman may have bought it because she knew it would get her a nomination, and I would guess nine actresses out of ten could have garnered a nomination from the role (it's just too well written not to attract Academy attention), but that doesn't take too much away from her achievement. Wiest would be an obvious second nomination (most certainly deserved), but the Academy should not overlook Eckhart, who gives his best performance to date. I have said nothing of John Cameron Mitchell, whose previous two films, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Shortbus, are among my favorite of the previous decade. He doesn't show his hand here at all. Indeed, it's definitely a director-for-hire type of job. But he is very subtle, so there's at least that.

Sensitive drama from writer David Lindsay-Abaire, based upon his play, about a benumbed married couple, mourning the death of their little boy, who seek different paths to deal with their grief; the wife forms a tentative friendship with the teenager who hit the child accidentally with his car, while the husband contemplates having an affair. The film unfolds carefully, and at times beautifully, but the bloom somehow fades with about fifteen minutes left on the clock--when one can almost sense the filmmakers' dilemma in bringing this story to a satisfying close. Director John Cameron Mitchell has an artistic eye, and he does superlative work with his actors, but many of the stronger scenes (such as Nicole Kidman slapping a woman in the supermarket, or Aaron Eckhart accusing Kidman of erasing a video from his phone) aren't built upon. The narrative is rather slipshod; instead of a forceful whole, we get intriguing episodes. **1/2 from ****

Initially, I avoided this movie because I read this sentence summary on IMDb: "Life for a happy couple is turned upside down after their young son dies in an accident." This sounded like a real downer. Yesterday, my wife and I had to decide between Another Year, The Company Men, and this movie. 

I checked out some of the reviews on Metacritic and IMDb and found some that said Rabbit Hole was inspiring and the other two, although good, could be depressing. We decided to go to Rabbit Hole and I'm so glad we did. 

I already knew the acting would be excellent and it was. I also found the cinematography to be very good and the story of coping with death of a child to be surprisingly up-lifting. I didn't find the film in any way to be difficult to watch.

Make no mistake about it, if you like independent films like the King's Speech, you're probably going to like this movie and you might love it as my wife and I do. Normally, I wouldn't give a move a 10, but this is definitely at least a 9 and I gave it a 10 so more people would possibly go and see it.

Rabbit Hole evolves around the drama of a family who lost their child. What can be more sad than this? There's no fiction in Rabbit Hole. Many people have suffered such lost. Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman melt together in their own drama, taking acting to another level, a level of realism and empathy. This movie is inspiring in its sadness. No special effects, no big screen 3D bangs, no forced screenplay. Rabbit Hole is the imagined cartoon world of an unintentional murderer, the driver of the car that killed Becca and Howie's son. In searching for forgiveness, the young driver invents this DC world, in which he finds redemption and more than that, a source of communicating his feelings to Becca, The Mother. This is a powerful drama. All i can say, in the end, is that forgiveness can be a cure for many wounded destinies. 10 from 10.

Im astounded at the positive reviews this movie is getting and the Oscar nomination for Kidman. Im sorry, but this movie is just not worth your time and lacks the emotional maturity and depth to deal with the subject matter in anything approaching a substantive way.

The goal is admirable enough. Delve into loss, grieving, moving on, tensions in a happy marriage. None of it is pulled off, everything is surface level with no resonance and the performances (Eckhart is best) are just bland and overly orchestrated.

There was only one part of the movie that actually drew a reaction out of me - when Kidman attacks the woman in the grocery store. The rest is completely unbelievable, their "climactic" argument is most agonizing.

To boot, the movie contradicts itself with its attempts at humour. When Ekhart and Kidman giggle and laugh at other in their 'grief group', and later on outright mock them, for their ridiculous self pity babbling, their own moments of grief cannot be taken seriously. Their own arguments and struggles become laughable - this is a main flaw in this film.

In any case, this is just my opinion. But I would HIGHLY urge anyone who did enjoy this movie (or did not but is interested in its subject matter) to watch Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Blue" (1993) for a movie that tackles this issue with true emotion and true maturity. Its for adults.
