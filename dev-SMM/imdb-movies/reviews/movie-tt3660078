### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
It's not about the goal, it's about journey. Or something like that, though if you're in a hurry you just want to arrive where you're heading. If you're one of those people this slow driven (pun intended) drama might not fit your viewing pleasures. It's decent overall with characters who "complete" each other, though in a very strange way.

There are hints of things that are interesting (prejudices or clich√©s depending on how you look on it), not all of them get explored properly though. Still the relationships work most of the time (no pun intended). There is a sense of dread that almost stops any lighter entertainment to break in, which might have helped the movie on some occasions. As it is, it's OK, but not great

"Taxi" is a German 2015 film that runs for slightly over 90 minutes with credits. It stars Rosalie Thomass as the main character and Peter Dinklage as her co-lead. Let me talk about Thomass a bit first. Sadly, her performance here proves that she is basically nothing more then this generation's Veronice Ferres. Big curves, blonde hair and no range. A very forgettable actress. The only thing I can say in her favor is how badly her character was written. But her lack of talent adds to that a lot as well. Peter Dinklage, on the other hand does a good job with what he is given and his performance makes painfully obvious how limited Thomass is. I really wonder how they got him to star in here. I cannot say a whole lot about Kerstin Ahlrichs' direction. I think it is okay for the most part. Karen Duve is the author who wrote the novel and adapted her own work for this film. It is a pretty disastrous effort I have to say. She attempts so hard to make the main character look likable but flawed. Instead the outcome is an arrogant, egocentric, ruthless, promiscuous young woman that is completely uninteresting and honestly I did not care at all what would happen to her. Actually, she was so unlikeable that I would have been okay with her not surviving the taxi crash, but hey a "Totalschaden" is something entirely desirable of course. And the worst was possibly the scene when she appears at Dinklage's character's home after weeks of absence and orders him to call the other girl and cancel their date. What a spoiled brat. Funnily, Thomass' looks do contribute nothing that justifies this egomaniac behavior, even if everybody wants us to believe otherwise. She is not good-looking. And this is not a good film. This is "Taxi Driver" gone very bad. Do not watch. If you want to see a good recent taxi-themed film, check out Jafar Panahi's.
