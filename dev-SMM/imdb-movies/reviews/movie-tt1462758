### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Buried is a film that keeps things deadly simple, one character, one location and a one line but horribly inspired plot, those looking for flashy visuals or big action should turn far, far away from this one. It's worth noting though that the film is well directed and photographed, director Rodrigo Cortes has a nimble eye for visuals and angles to keep things visually interesting, while cinematographer Eduard Grau gets the best out of the mere two light sources to make the experience a frighteningly vivid one. The plot sees Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin, with nothing more than a cell-phone and his lighter to help him out, things develop through his series of fraught, occasionally bleakly amusing and increasingly desperate communications with the outside world. Its rather interesting to see a film so based around interactions on a mobile phone, devices so often objects of fear, suspicion, or in the case of some horror films and of course the cinematic experience for the viewer, irritations. Here every ring is crucial, the battery bar is nail-biting, even the light of the screen is important. For me, just as interesting was the choice of lead. I've never had time for Ryan Reynolds, a face from some of the worst in lowbrow comedy and someone I never expected to appreciate breaking through into not just serious film but something as bold in its structure as this. A lot of people are likely to dislike the film on a fundamental level, but Reynolds gives the performance of his life here, running through a rainbow of emotions, angry, sarcastic and terrified are but a few. Compelling and sympathetic, likely physically arduous too (though I'd don't know how the film was made it must have been tough, barring serious trickery) he holds the film wonderfully. The script is of course of utmost importance too, and writer Chris Sparling does mostly terrific work. An ordinary man reacting as best he can to a nightmare, drawing on the sort of resourcefulness he probably hoped he'd never need, occasionally breaking down but keeping ploughing on, shades of dark humour in the protagonist's travails on the phone, its endlessly interesting and as time goes on, nail-bitingly suspenseful. I had minor issues with realism in the film, and there was at least one interesting little aside that could have been developed a bit more, but overall this is a great achievement. It surely won't appeal to everyone and my rating might seem generous, but for doing this well on such a risky concept, and putting together a suspenser that remains thought provoking after, a 9/10 from me.

I caught this gem at Sundance earlier in the year. It was part of the 'Park City at midnight' group of films, which showcased horror and thriller movies, and played them at, can you guess? Midnight. I saw Buried on the last night of the festival, Ryan Reynolds wasn't there, but both the director and writer were. It was a small theater on Main street, very artsy in it's look. But once the film started I had eyes only for the screen.

It starts off with Ryan waking up, trapped in a box. A long box, the length of a human body, buried deep beneath the ground. From there the film plays out in an awe inspiring way, especially seeing as there's only so much you can reveal from one location. The way Rodrigo Cortes handled the filming is truly exceptional. From the start the camera switches between closely claustrophobic, and flying high above Ryan, showing the box with him inside and black all around. It's constantly on the move just like our main character's thoughts. Diving in when the action is intense, and then cutting to black when you don't think you can take any more.

The pacing and plot of the film were nothing short of genius. And Chris Sparling, the writer, should be commended for his work. He said after the showing, that after having his scripts rejected for their cost of locations he decided to go for a cheep but genius idea. One location, one star, and a wealth of idea's. It makes a film like 'Salt' look like a giant waste of resources, when Buried does what even some of the best thrillers can't do, it brings us inside the character's head, and does it all without a romp through the city, or blowing things up.

If you're one of those people who loves to sit on the edge of your seat, chewing at your fingernails, while you're constantly asking yourself what's going to happen next. Then by all means watch Buried, and consider yourself lucky that you're not in his shoes...

If this doesn't remain in my top five come year-end I will be shocked. Who thought that a movie can not only sustain a full 90mins stuck within the confines of a coffin (and believe me, it doesn't leave the coffin) but that it would be one of the most cinematic and audacious pieces of cinema I've seen in a good few years? Like this year's Inception and Toy Story 3, movies like Buried are the reason I love cinema. It is escapism at it's best, ironic considering the setting. Who thought Ryan Reynolds, Van Wilder: Party Liaison himself could be so utterly mesmerising in such a challenging role? The movie is literally his. Sure, there are those he speaks to over the phone (he's buried with a Zippo and a Blackberry) but for the film's length, he is the only physical presence on screen. He goes through every emotion possible: fear, panic, anger, sadness, happiness, depression, acceptance, and all of it played so convincingly that you almost wonder whether they genuinely buried the actor and left a camera in there with him.

There are minor gripes, all predominantly found in the first half. It feels somewhat episodic at times and there's a lack of any real tension during the first forty minutes but this is a pressure cooker of a film and the last half is unrelenting to the point of nausea, culminating in a truly great finale that caused me to shout-out in the quiet, near empty cinema.

Buried is extraordinary. The only performance to beat Reynolds' in recent years is Sam Rockwell's stunning turn in Moon. High concept thrillers like this rise or fall on the delivery of their challenging set ups. Fortunately, Buried works.

It really, really works.

I wasn't expecting this film to be set entirely within a coffin and nor was I expecting Ryan Reynolds to be much good. As it turned out I was wrong on both counts! Brief summary:Ryan is a contract driver in Iraq whose vehicle is attacked by Iraqis. He wakes up in a coffin buried underground with a few "helpful" tools...and so ensues a claustrophobic, frustrating and scary journey for both the character and the audience! I found Ryan's performance quite compelling and was almost living the experience with him, I even found myself holding my breath at times and feeling quite panicky! The fact that you can't see what is going on above ground adds to the tension and you are never quite sure what to believe.

I also found this a thought provoking film on another level. It's very easy to immediately dismiss the hostage takers as "the baddies" but I think this is a very shallow and naive view of human nature. It made me think, that transcending race, religion and nationality, what would any human be capable of doing in the their situation. These are sometimes hard working law abiding people who have seen their country torn apart by war, who have seen their children dying and who no longer have any other way of making money, and who see the Americans as to blame for this....not that I want to sound like I was on their side at all or that I condone it in any way, which I don't, but I found this film a very interesting study into human survival instinct and desperation. 

A very good film, probably the best thing out at the moment, along with The Town, and definitely worth the ticket price. 

And to the reviewer that felt this was a 95 minute terrorist propaganda movie, shame on you! You clearly misunderstood the entire film!

I hate it when fantastic movies such as this get completely overlooked when it comes time for awards to be handed out. Buried is a triumph in minimalist filmmaking and is a heart wrenchingly intense movie experience. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and terrifying. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a box. Paul Conroy, who is played by Ryan Reynolds and is the only character in the movie we actually see, wakes up in a coffin buried under the ground with no idea how he got there or who put him there. He shortly finds out that he is being held by ransom by a group of terrorists in Iraq. With only a pen, a flask, a cell phone, and only 90 minutes of oxygen, Paul has to act fast. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredibly thrilling experience.

How much can you really expect from a movie that takes place in a human sized box with only one person? Buried delivers a lot more than you would expect from this scenario. It has all the right elements to make it as enthralling as any action film we see today. To start off, Rodrigo Cortes does a great job directing his limited space. He miraculously pulls off a lot of great shots and brilliant claustrophobic nuances. He directs with enough skill to keep the movie interesting in its entirety. The movie never felt lagged or drawn out and every moment where it would have slowed down it would throw a great twist or shocking moment that drew you right back in.

Furthermore, the director does a lot of great artistic work with what little he to work with. We have to take into consideration the fact that when you are buried underground in a coffin, there is obviously zero light. Thankfully Paul has various light sources with him in the coffin. And so to keep from breaking the realism of the film, these light sources are the only light in the film, making sure all light is authentic. Paul's light sources include a lighter, a flashlight, a cell phone, and a green glow stick. Each of these light sources gives off a different color, and these colors which obviously encompass everything when they are present add to and reflect the mood of the film. When things are calmer (relatively of course) we are treated to the soft blue light of the cell phone. As things grow more suspenseful and harrowing we are treated to scenes lit by the green glow stick. And when things grow more sinister the red lens of the flashlight is used. I found these minute details fascinating and they artistically added a lot to a film which had little room to work with.

While Cortes' directing gives the film plenty of life, Ryan Reynold's stalwart performance really drives the emotion of the film. He delivers a top notch performance, and he as to seeing as he is the only character in the film other than the various people he talks to on the phone which we never actually see. It can't be easy to carry a film all by yourself, but this year we were treated to two performances that did a superb job at it, the other of course being James Franco in 127 Hours.

Buried is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of. It is a groundbreaking thriller that does so much with so little. It is such a harrowing movie experience that you cannot forget. All 90 minutes of this film are fascinating and gripping, especially the last fifteen. The final moments of the film are some of the most captivating and enthralling moments I've ever experienced through film. During the finale of the film you will want nothing more than to know the fate of Paul Conroy, and when you finally do learn his fate at the close of the film your jaw will drop and you will be utterly blown away by such a captivating on screen experience.

Buried has an interesting concept to work with... man stuck in buried coffin, limited supplies and oxygen... yadda yadda yadda. But the filmmakers decided to make the story and the protagonist (Ryan Reynolds) dumb as bricks, which basically tanks the movie. There are so many flaws in Buried that it's beyond irritating and makes you demand your 95 minutes back; from the constant use of a lighter when there's supposedly limited oxygen, to the inability of the protagonist to stay calm for one second and figure out an escape plan instead of shouting into a cell phone from beginning to end. Any thrills or intrigue are quickly stifled by the aforementioned poor writing and trademark Ryan Reynolds school of douchebaggery acting.

127 Hours was another 2010 movie that had a guy stuck in a tough situation where survival seemed impossible. But the protagonist in that one actually survives because he was resourceful and tough as nails. Throughout, the movie is thrilling and really takes you on an emotional and sensory roller coaster. However, the thing that is really ironic is that 127 Hours is a TRUE STORY. The filmmakers of this fictional trite that is Buried couldn't even come up with a story that is more interesting than what happens in the real world. The point of many fictional movies is to take you out of the realms of reality, like an escape. Buried not only doesn't do that, there are also no thrills or excitement. Even if the movie was supposed to be more grounded in reality, it fails at that as well.

It's a bit hard to review this special movie. You can't go into special effects because there were non. You can't say anything about the cast because it's just one person you see. And the set is simple too, just a coffin. Yes, indeed, it all takes place in a coffin. So that's already tricky to watch because I know a lot of people who didn't liked it because there was nothing to see or watch and I must agree with them. It takes indeed almost an hour before the suspense comes in. The first hour you will learn everything about the character, perfectly played by Ryan Reynolds. But it's all done on phone. Of course, being buried you can't do anything else than phone but for me it was a bit too long, an hour as I said. But from then on it goes faster and things go from worse to terribly wrong. The ending was a surprise for me. I won't spoil it just watch it. Still, I won't state it as a horror either a suspense or thriller. But you have to experience the coffin setting to sit it through. Simple story, excellent camera tricks.

The movie is full of flaws. The lighter burning during most of the film?? How much oxygen does he have. He also uses the lighter to look at the screen of his phone which has a back light and nearly has as much light as the lighter. The snake comes out of nowhere and disappears into nowhere.

The people he rings to help couldn't care less. He writes with a pen upside down even a marker wouldn't work due to gravity. And there is many more. So many mistakes will turn smart people off.

Why he didn't try to use the knife to break out of the coffin is beyond me. He was told he was only a few feet below the sand, even as a last resort he could have attempted it.

Its just so obvious its a low budget movie but where did they spend 3 million honestly its mind boggling. Its a miserable film and I kept checking how long more was left. With a few minutes to go I was wondering how they will end it and ya the end was as terrible as the whole thing. It has no point at all. Its so slow all the way through and to be honest if it was any longer I would have packed it in and cut my losses.

Stay well clear of this disaster

In 90 mins, you will see how fast this Blackberry battery goes, and how stupid Paul is trying to get himself out from the coffin.

Okay, this is probably a man's worst nightmare - buried alive. But in this movie, no fancy story behind, but just about war, terrorists, govt, etc. The most boring boring boring element.

So here we goes, with a phone that actually have reception, a zippo lighter, a knife, there are lots of ways to try to get himself out, but in every ways he does, he did it the wrong way.

Now I think even an idiot knows we need oxygen to stay alive, and in this case, our Paul seems to think there are actually too much oxygen for him, so he decided to light up the zippo and burn as much as oxygen every time he make a stupid phone call!!!! COME ON PAUL!!! I don't see Paul is getting smart but with a phone he probably could just call anyone that able to help him. But he chose to trust the US Govt. Alright, that's your call Paul, but when his company, FBI and whatever dealing-with-hostage-expert cannot help, Paul, You'd better think of something better.

Here is my favorite part, a fxxking snake came from no where, suddenly appear in Paul's pants and then get out. Okay, I can live with that, becoz when a snake could get in, and Paul have a knife, he could probably at least try to break the coffin and dig his way out! Nah, our Paul still think he has enough oxygen and let's burn the snake heck out! Blah blah blah that with that lawsuit phone call from his company, what the hell??? There are ways to make Paul desperate but this part is just a really sick cheap shot!!!! I don't really see how Paul is getting himself out, but just watching him die every minute closer.

Some people might think they not gonna buy a blackberry phone becoz the battery run out in 90 mins. =p Some people might think Paul might get out and let's see how he do it. But no, he is dead becoz he's stupid.

Some people might think what the heck, I just want to watch a movie for fun... OOPS, "Buried" is not fun either.

So that's it, there's no way Paul could live, why don't we give a chance to some other movies?

Seriously this movie is just disappointing!!! A very, very stupid guy in a coffin trying to figure out how to survive but doing absolutely nothing worthwhile for 90 minutes... :( It takes a few minutes then you really dislike the guy! OK so its very sad for him he's buried alive in a coffin! I'll give him that! But after fumbling around with the Zippo lighter for what feels like YEARS - he should get the point! He's in a coffin - he needs the oxygen and YET HE KEEPS BURNING THE STUPID ZIPPO LIGHTER! Even after he finds a telephone with more light than the Zippo he still uses the LIGHTER who consumes all his oxygen.... ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? And everyone who's ever held a Zippo knows how hot it gets if you burn it a long time... Not only that but he spends most of his time talking to people who gives a damn... or doesn't believe him or he's horribly rude to people! And so many things are just done for the action and are so not believable... The snake for instance... if it can get IN the coffin and OUT again so can he! But no he has to use the brandy or whatever it is in the cantina to start a fire and burn all the oxygen! He has the knife from the bag that he doesn't find before the KIDNAPPER informs him its there although it has LOTS of thing in it! And whats up with that ridiculous call from his employers?!? Even people who doesn't know ANYTHING about lawsuits and insurance can hear that he should hang up that call after just the first few sentences but he just lies there and answers! Seriously after that I almost wish he just dies! Thats how obnoxious he is! Thats how illogical he is... He keeps doing so many stupid things in that coffin that you just can't believe it!!! And yes its not even original - People have been buried alive in movies so many times - and yes the CSI episode probably is fresh in memory but at least Nick Parker doesn't behave like an obnoxious little brat for 90 minutes so I'd rather watch that episode ten times than having to ever re watch this horrible, horrible movie!!!!

Overall, I was utterly disappointed with this film. After hype surrounding the release my expectations were running high, but I found myself leaving the cinema feeling cheated and empty.

It follows the story of an American truck driving contractor who, prior to the start of the film is ambushed and placed in a wooden coffin and buried underground. The film starts with Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), waking up inside the coffin. The rest of the film follows Paul as he tries to follow the demands of his captors as well as negotiate his rescue with seemingly incompetent and unconcerned operators in America.

The film lacked any real plot line and major events, and seemed to just flow from start to finish in almost a single scene. With an estimated budget of approx. $3 million I expected so much more, especially seeing as it started Ryan Reynolds, but I was let down with poor camera work and a very poor script.

A very claustrophobic atmosphere is created inside the coffin, but the film is just over saturated with close up shots a dark lighting. I understand the angle the director was taking whilst creating this atmosphere but it was just too heavy, and I am not surprised that the film only make approx. $100,000 on opening weekend. I feel for anyone (like myself) who entered the cinema with high hopes as you will most likely be solely disappointed and left feeling why a star such as Ryan Reynolds would put his name to such a travesty.

Buried: in which Ryan Reynolds is en-tombed underground in a coffin like structure with only a cell phone and a lighter for company spending 90 minutes crying out for help to anyone who will listen. Director Rodrigo Cortes keeps the drama entirely inside this average-sized coffin-like box but as anyone who watched Hitchcock play with space and tension in Rope and Lifeboat will know how inventive one has to be with limited room, Cortes used his skill to make this experiment work brilliantly with some interesting lighting effects to keep it visually interesting. After watching this movie I was left physically trembling. This was partly because the final five minutes are about as nail-biting as five minutes of film can possibly be, but mostly because of the tremendous adoration I have for the filmmakers who have achieved so much with so little. Whoever says you need to think outside the box should think again, because Buried is nothing short of a minimalist masterpiece. bravo for a very brave ending.

Amazingly for once the movie critics actually like a film. This movie is well liked by critics and generally has received acclaim from different festivals, including Sundance. Also as per usual is the critics' keen eye for being horribly consistent with their poor choices. They hate and pick on great movies and love the awful ones. 

Buried has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one of the most unconvincing movies ever made.

Firstly, the premise is boring. I, unlike critics, didn't find it claustrophobic or Hitchcock thriller like. For any potential viewers, I warn you now: DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! 

In all seriousness, the plot is that Ryan Reynolds' character Paul Conroy is a truck driver in Iraq, delivering random goods to a community center when his convoy is attacked. He blacks out and wakes up buried alive in a coffin. He finds a cell phone in Arabic, a knife, a canteen and a Zippo lighter. He gets a call from the person who took him hostage. They are holding him ransom for $5 million dollars. They're not terrorists but simply commoners who have a starving family. The movie revolves around Paul trying to get out of the coffin. He spends a lot of time, calling different law enforcement agencies in America, before getting hold of a hostage negotiator in Iraq, placed there by the US.

The entire film sees Ryan Reynolds in a coffin. There are not even any flashbacks, so we see nothing but the dark and the inside of a box.

MAIN ISSUES 

Acting- Let's throw out a general disclaimer of 'I have no beef with Ryan'. I love his other movies. But, he is just not cut out for serious acting. He tries to record his final will and manages to do so horribly, even attempting humor. "You can have the $700 dollars in my savings account" makes me want to punch myself out, to put myself out of my misery. The people he manages to reach on the cell phone all have ridiculously fake accents and their daftness makes you wonder of the IQ of the scriptwriter. He tells a woman he's buried alive and she asks for his social security number. His emotional scenes leave us wanting, and the movie is quite offensive to Americans. He repeatedly says that they don't care to save an innocent truck driver and that he'll die like so many other innocents have.

Percentages- We spend 1% of the movie with a black screen, indicating darkness. 10% with him scribbling numbers with his pen on the roof of the coffin (you can't write with a pen upside down! Gravity...), 30% with him making pointless phone calls and the remaining 59% of the screen time with him grunting and carrying on, unrealistically. He sounded like a squealing pig when he grunted and groaned, trying to move in the confined space.

General Plot- There are a few issues and points raised. A lot of things just don't add up. If he was a few feet from the surface, why didn't he use the knife and break open the crate and make a run for it? He could hold his breath for 30 seconds and doggy-paddle through the sand.

Why didn't he give the hostage negotiator his phone number to trace after he managed to change the phone's settings to English? He said the tracing didn't work, but they only tried it by location. Had he given them his phone number, they would have found him.

So, did he end up cheating with Pamela or not? How did he not run out of oxygen? How did the phone battery not die? How did his torches and everything else survive? He would always leave them on for no reason when he randomly 'gave up'. Where did the petrol for the snake fire come from? He'd been using the canteen as water earlier to take his anxiety tablets.

Who jokes in a "last moments" video? Why didn't he send it? How will anyone find the buried video? 

There are just too many plot inconsistencies, poor acting etc... I can't handle it. I'll hit the sack instead. But, in summary...

...it's a catastrophic miss.

The plot is a guy with a zippo lighter and a mobile phone is trapped underground in a box for 90 minuites while the oxygen runs out. That is literally all it is a guy in a box. The guy winds everyone up that it is possible for him to such as wasting his phone battery, accepting calls at stupid times most of which are either pointless video requests or being put on hold. He literally calls everyone he knows before calling people worth talking to and does not figure out how to change the language setting until half way through. He makes fires and spills chemicals no wonder this man died after 90 minuites in a coffin. The ending is poor as the man dies after just being told that they are digging up the wrong guy. One that they had said earlier had been saved.

Strongly advise against seeing this film I have to admit to being this bored only a very few times in a cinema. The plot is predictable, including the death of Mark White, and frankly repetitive. This film was very much an attempt, in my eyes, to be the new "Blair Witch". The entire film being shot in the coffin was a poor attempt to offer atmosphere, the cinema screen being large and not offering any claustrophobic feelings. Also, I heard several people snoring during the 4pm showing. I won't tell you the comments at the end of the film, due to the guidelines we need to stick to. 1 out of 10 is a generous review for this waste of 95 minutes. Zero would be more accurate.

A man wakes up to find himself locked in a buried coffin with nothing but a cell phone, lighter and a flask of alcohol. That's the simple premise for this unique thriller. Ryan Reynolds brings his acting talents to a role that breaks from his usual comedic style. The film's 95 minute running time is completely dependent on Reynolds and he delivers a completely believable and realistic performance. 

On top of Reynolds' performance this Spanish/Australian production boasts amazing direction by Spanish director, Rodrigo Cortes and a thrilling musical score by Victor Reyes. The simplicity of the plot allows the filmmakers to truly get creative. Having an entire film with only one character in a coffin using what seems to be natural lighting? Not a problem. The script even manages to have a lot to say (it's set in Iraq) whilst continuously raising the tension levels to the point of it nearly being unbearable. 

Buried is a suspenseful and exciting thriller that forces the viewer to feel claustrophobic at every opportunity. This isn't just a movie, it's an exhausting experience that leaves you breathless.

Although I might touch on a few details appearing in the film, I do not consider this to be a spoiler, as there is not much to spoil really!

The film is about a (stupid) guy in a coffin with a Zippo, a Mobile and some Lights... 

As I want to spare you with the sudden appearance of a death-bringing snake and calls to people that seem to have decided to prank him, this is all you have to know! 

One and a half hours of terrible dialogs and a picturing of someone dying in a wooden box. Whether this takes place in Afghanistan or elsewhere really does not matter at all...

Definitely not worth filming OR watching!

With all the raves about this movie before its release, I KNEW it would be good and have sat waiting on pins and needles for it to reach my town. Now that it's here and I've seen it, I have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life! 

Suspense only works when there's rescue and a pay-off! Hitchcock-like in its opening music and spacing of tension,"Buried" ends up as pointless as a mother who gives birth to a baby and then buries it in the back yard to all loss to her, where she and everyone around listens insensitively to it scream for a rescue, only to berate it for crying in distress and insisting it needs to calm down and change its attitude--baby whose loss of life she's paying for! Thirty years later, baby buried in its hole in the ground where Mama has left it is still crying to everyone in hearing distance to be saved--with no savior in sight and having been accused of deserving its abuse and neglect by everyone in a life just thrown away for no point!

Atypical of anyone who has no helper that has been overtaken by an enemy and left good as dead, Ryan's character of Paul Conroy sufficiently wastes the first THIRTY minutes of the movie trying to use the cell phone he was left with to get someone in the world to hear and understand that his truck had been seized and him buried in a coffin somewhere he couldn't pinpoint underground--all the frustration of answering machines and no one home, hold calls, hangups, the fight with his what--mother- or sister-in law as he tried to learn his wife's whereabouts, disconnects and reconnects...before inevitable contact by the embezzler that had buried him with the phone on the heels of a hostage negotiator determined to find him out of thin air--literally--I should have known then: all that suspense--just for the "call" to be dropped at the end with no further reconnect.... And after his 'indecent' "Proposal" of a movie with Sandra Bullock last year, I'd thought Reynolds had come into his own with this one--but it looks like it just got buried in its dirt! Waste your time watching it and you're going to be the same--buried in a hole of a cemetery plot-line with no way to dig yourself out! I can't understand how it is that so many reviewers here have found it divine! 

Thus, successfully murdered by my hour and a half on this turkey of a before-Thanksgiving Dinner Cortés has served me for nothing, I'm going to get the life and blood pumping back into me by feasting on a reviewing of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz' high octane summer comedy romance suspense adventure thrill-ride "Knight And Day." A REAL Thanksgiving for THAT happy meal...!

My English is questionable, but if you after this movie READ the so called MASTERPIECE movie statements and mainly on the message board. Then it gets pretty clear what kind of IQ those people posses to call this a masterpiece. 

Long story short, man gets taken hostage and buried alive, he has a cellphone. And then the man in that coffin gets to hear he was already FIRED (to cover there asses) then in the end he dies very realistically. 

That is according to the "this is a masterpiece" mediocre reviewers. 

Here some FACTS Mr realistic..

Say for argument sake he is buried 6ft under the ground (average size coffin). A quick calculation would come to a running out of air in about an hour and 18 minutes. And this is when he breaths NORMALLY. 

The movie is already to long for that not to mention the how he is full of fear (using up more air) make it 1 hour and he would be going to the other world and that is not fiction. However the ending is that he dies and end of the movie. 

He is a American, the hajid has a totally wrong VOICE to be one. Then his so called angel (the man who talks him through it) sounds nothing like a American (UK by the tone of it) nothing wrong there. I mean I've been even fast forwarding this movie it was that BORING. And that badly done, then the snake that comes into the coffin. 

HE LITS A FIRE TO CHASE IT AWAY...so the air would run out in 45min already. I mean realistic? Really some of you guys should do some more research. Nobody needs a SUPER IQ these says to simply type a few things on the WWW. 

OK but i do respect both camps, some like it some hate it. To me this is properly the worst piece of movie-making i have so far seen in this year. Buried flopped as i heard some were here lost 2 million or something. WELL THATS BECAUSE ITS NOT A GOOD MOVIE! SORRY FANBOYS...

I know will get critics over me now, and properly many 0 people find this review not helping them. That is OK I'm glad i set my standards higher concerning movie-making then them. 

Do enjoy, but you have be warned you will be utterly bored by it. And the so called "realism" well see what i write do the math. Its not that hard to defeat that comment of the fans. 

Just another overrated "masterpiece" by groupies here on IMDb.

If you are going to watch this movie, please fast forward the first hour because it is extremely boring, predictable and frustrating. A guy in a coffin makes a bunch of phone calls from his blackberry. Yes, the blackberry can take it all, fire, dust. Nice commercial. Thats about it. 

All you want to watching this movie is to put duct tape on the coffin dudes mouth. Ofc he is scared and all that but Jesus... He acts like a tard. Can't even do a phone call without questioning everything. Everything! Frustration...

Heck they even had to put a snake in the coffin. They really had no other things to come up with than to put a snake in the coffin with the guy. 

In the beginning of the movie the oxygen was running out as the guy in the coffin had a hard time breathing. Luckily however, oxygen came into the coffin (magic?) because at the end of the movie he can breathe without problems, even tho he spent most of the time in the coffin being rude to people on phone and acting like a complete tard wasting his oxygen on as many things as he could come up with, i.e shouting.

Tbh, I would rather spend 1,5 hours buried in a coffin than watching this piece of crap.

Your task if you choose to accept it is to escape from a wooden box several feet below ground using the handy knife we left in there with you. Should have been over in 15 minutes if the guy had seen a film like Kill Bill 2. But of course we had 90 minutes to fill so instead our 'hero' was in fact a brain dead American who had the survival skills of a lemming. The first thing he does is drains the battery of the handy phone his captors left by phoning everyone in America to shout at them instead of finding someone who could help and just phoning them. After that he does his best to drain the array of handy lights scattered around and use up his oxygen by having hissy fits and lighting a Zippo. When he does get in touch with someone who can help who gives him handy information such as he is likely buried a few feet below ground he wastes time doing a survey with his bosses who want to disown him. Most non Americans would have used the knife to break out and moled their way to the surface but then we would not have had the climactic ending which resulted in much sadness as Coffin Boy found out his rescuers had rescued the wrong coffin. All this shows the viewing audience is that Americans really should not be allowed to stray more than a 100 yards from their home as they are incapable of survival and poor at stress situations. Possibly the most boring movie ever made but who knows we may yet see Buried II.

The stupidest movie I've seen in my life. It probably looked good on paper in the development stages. Too bad no one involved with production asked any serious questions before committing to film. (At least it wasn't an expensive film to make. Must've saved a TON on location shooting.....Reynolds' basement?)

Here come some spoilers (not they could possibly make your experience worse): 

I can understand the anxiety being buried alive in a coffin, but c'mon. Everyone knows that even a small flame is going to burn a lot of oxygen in a small space. Why do you keep burning the lighter? Keep doing that and you'll be dead before the end of the movie.

And who, taken hostage by the enemy and buried alive would even TALK to his captors? "F you, buddy! I'm not talking to you until you get me out." Block his incoming calls. At the very least, don't answer.

I don't know about you, but if I'm a hostage trapped in a coffin and my boss calls me to confirm all my employment info, I would have told him to go F himself and hang up. Then I would make a video about what my boss just did and send THAT to Al Jazeera.

The problem with this film is that it's totally unbelievable once you ask yourself that very first question.

Don't waste your money and your time on this one. You'll likely be very disappointed.

This obnoxious movie has made me produce my first IMDb review ever. Realized as the director's sadomasochistic fantasy on the screen, the movie left me almost physically disturbed and nauseated. Extremely visceral tortures of the main and only character shamelessly exploit everyone's fear of being buried alive - with no apparent moral or artistic reason. If this movie is about being buried alive, then any value it could have has always been born dead.

After spending these awful ninety minutes in the coffin with the stupid Paul, I was trying to understand why the director put me there. And I see no other reasons than the most stupid ones such as these: 

Showing that the more you like national symbols (the terrorist mentions the American flag decorating Paul's house in Michigan, and there a tattoo reminiscent of American flag on Paul's wrist) the less government cares about you.

Showing that all mothers-in-law are inane witches who like to have fun and not to care if their sons-in-law call in trembling voice (from Iraq, by the way) and not even bother to tell about this their daughters.

Showing that, while all the other technology fails on you, your cigarette lighter is an everlasting product with amazing qualities. (it is good though that, together with dying Paul has also quit smoking)

Showing that all lawyers are deeply inhuman beings.

Showing the exciting underground life of snakes whose little hobby is to get into and out of every man pants.

Showing what happens to the person who is cheating on his wife. The director did not provide us with any other possible reasons of why the universe was so cruel to Paul and not to any other American citizen which was available for kidnapping that day in Iraq.

I could not get any other comprehensible messages ("the famous American family values") from this movie. Paul's voice message to his son is the epitome of very bad taste and very poor acting. It is a boring and stupid reason to make a movie, unless you are a sadist and like to see what happens to a person who is buried alive with the closest approximation.

Why the director who cares so much to make you feel like you are in coffin, treats his spectators as the most stupid people? Why Paul is burning his oxygen with his lighter? Because the viewer needs to see something and it is not possible without light. Why the director would not come up with something more inventing? As a result, you cannot be compassionate for someone as stupid as Paul.

The movie's aim is to hit you, literally, physically hit you - not to move you aesthetically or ethically but to simply kick you in your face. That's what that dull movie is all about.

I have no idea why would someone make a movie as boring as this was. Also I have no idea why the hell it has so good rating. It's a movie about some guy in a box. What pi**ed me off was that he had a flashlight, phone, some 3'rd light option and lighter. Guess what option did he use to see in the dark. Yes the dumbest of them all.. lighter. As you know light burns air but I guess the film makers didn't bother to check in to these little details. Also he was constantly doing something instead of trying to stay calm and not waste air. But again, I guess the film makers think that you can dance in a coffin with candles for 120 min and everything is cool.

Do not waste your time on this crap.
