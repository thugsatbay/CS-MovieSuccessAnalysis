### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
As a fan of the "coming of age" story structure, I am happy to report that this film met my expectations in every single way. Some key plot points were predictable, but the writing, performances and soundtrack were all on point. The emotions and experiences the film conveys do not feel artificial, and Hailee Steinfeld shines! Intelligent writing and little twists here and there will likely leave you genuinely invested in the life of these characters and leave you wanting more. Woody Harrelson plays a wonderful image of a teacher dealing with his life amidst high school drama and Kyra Sedgwick's performance as a struggling mother was especially heart felt and real. This is not to be missed for fans of this genre!

Remember all those teen movies about how much fun it is to be a teenager? Porky's, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all those American Pie movies and movies that spend an inordinate amount of time at the beach, to name a few. These are typical teenage movies. The Edge of Seventeen is not a typical teenage movie, and that is what makes it so great. Oh, there have been other great non-typical teenage films of late, like The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but somehow Seventeen stands alone.

Perhaps it is the intense and thoroughly committed performance of Hailee Steinfeld who started her film career under the tutelage of the Cohn Brothers in their remake of True Grit (oh yeah, and was nominated for an Oscar at the age of 14, although principle filming occurred while she was 13). Hailee so captures the angst of Nadine, whose name alone sets her apart, (Nadine was the most common name given to baby girls in 1958); that one cannot help but ache for her. Nadine carries the weight of the world on her shoulders and believes herself to be unlike any of the other kids who text each other about the tacos they're eating, and communicate in emojis.

She plays well alongside her favorite teacher, portrayed cheekily by Woody Harrelson who provides some of the best laughs in the film, as one might expect. Also of note, I think, is the quirky, lovable and downright cute performance of Hayden Szeto as Erwin. Erwin sits next to Nadine in class stumbling and bumbling his way through awkward repartee in the hopes of some sort of hook-up. But nothing is typical here, and the course that said repartee takes leads us into uncharted teen territory. It might also be interesting to note that the name Erwin was the most common baby name in 1918, which makes this Erwin an old soul, to be sure.

Kelly Fremon Craig has written a real gem here, and his first directing effort will earn him much critical acclaim, to be sure. The thing he does masterfully is take us inside the character of Nadine by giving us so many moments alone with her; moments when we experience in her stillness, in her eyes, and in her facial discipline as an actress the absolute bankruptcy of her isolation. None of us would want to be seventeen again, or ever; at least not her seventeen.

I am grateful to the studio, and to the Marcus Corporation for giving some of us movie lovers an opportunity to pre-screen this film that will be released on November 18th. I suppose they hope we will say good things about it and get others to go see the film. Well, go see the film. You will laugh, and you will need a few tissues, but you will not regret having spent a few hours walking in Nadine's shoes. Perhaps there is a little Nadine in all of us after all.

John Hughes is an unmistakable touchstone of the coming of age 1980s high school dramedy. Films like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off chronicled the adolescent experience of growing up, dealing with teen angst and self-actualization while mixing in a dash of old fashioned screwball comedy which at once provides relatable laughter for the viewer while making the dramatic pills easier to swallow. All of those undeniably come to mind when watching the directorial debut of Post Grad screenwriter Kelly Fremon Craig, The Edge of Seventeen, a coming of age high school comedy about a socially awkward and unhappy teenage girl named Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld from True Grit) whose best friend enters a relationship with her hunky older brother (Blake Jenner from Everybody Wants Some). And yet it is Amy Heckerling's Fast Times at Ridgemont High that The Edge of Seventeen finds its closest antecedent in, providing at once a funny and sympathetic rom com and a decidedly darker, more explicit look at budding female sexuality in a world adorned with dumb horny males who care nothing for the heroine's plight and emotional crossroads. At times its unbearable watching Nadine suffer while at the same time the film doesn't deny her own complicitness in the creation of her teenage misery. At first on the outset this looked like another Juno/Ghost World lovechild but as it progressed I was surprised how funny, charming, touching and well thought out this portrait of adolescent fear, anxiety and depression really was. Sure we've seen this movie done to death, but The Edge of Seventeen provided a fresh spin on the proceedings that kept it from blending together with what came before it.

I can't say that I expected to see this movie opening weekend, or at all for that matter. But I'm glad I did. The Edge of Seventeen is an awkwardly charming coming of age tale that flirts in the same vein as some classic John Hughes 80's flicks.

I think all of us have been keeping an eye on Hailee Steinfeld since True Grit in 2010. When you can steal scenery from the likes of Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin, you know you have someone special. The Edge of Seventeen is an entirely different genre and obstacle for Steinfeld, however. I almost think that the coming-of- age-teenage-angst-comedy-drama's are the most difficult films to reach a broad audience, perhaps even more so than westerns. I usually need something to hook me before I spend money on one of these, and that came by way of Woody Harrelson.

Harrelson play's Steinfeld's teacher and common companion at lunch when there's no one else to sit with. The brilliant thing about this relationship is that its neither too dramatic nor too goofy, the writers find a nice balance between gut busting laughs on Harrelson's end to a nice dramatic payoff in the latter half. For all the clichés that this film inevitably has, this relationship was something very refreshing and served as the highlights for most of the film.

Nadine (Steinfeld) has several issues with her mother, brother, and best friend to figure out throughout the course of the film. But it was pleasing to see that the writers didn't choose to make any one character in the right or wrong. I constantly felt like I was playing out both sides in my head as to who I believe had the right to be mad at the other or vice versa. Being in a family of 7, I can definitely relate to some of the family obstacles Nadine goes through, and it wasn't Hollywoodized just for the sake of pushing the plot forward. There's unfortunately quite a few clichéd tropes that this film ends up taking you toward, but it felt more natural than most of these types of films. This could be attributed to the welcomed R rating the film received.

It isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't even consider myself the target audience. But it speaks to larger personal and family issues than the trailer sets up. It's also one of the best Woody Harrelson performances I've seen recently, even if he is probably as reserved as he's ever been.

+Steinfeld carries this film

+With the help of the hilarious Harrelson

Kelly Fremon Craig wrote and directed the 2016 coming-of-age story, The Edge of Seventeen. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Haley Lu Richardson, and Woody Harrelson, The Edge of Seventeen tells the ever so familiar tale of navigating high school and the awkward teenage years just as your world begins to fall apart. Kelly Fremon Craig follows the formula of a coming-of-age story while still managing to tug at the heartstrings of the audience and keep us engaged through the final scene. Brilliantly written with a wonderful cast, The Edge of Seventeen is sure to gain attention this Oscar season.

Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) has always been, a little different. There was a time in her life in which she felt like such an outcast, she refused to get out of the car and enter school. Everything changed when she met Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) Finally, Nadine had a friend and felt like she belonged with someone. Nadine and Krista were attached at the hip, navigating life's challenges and the unique difficulties of their lives. Nadine has always felt overshadowed by her older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) who seems to never have a challenge with any aspect of his life. Nadine never felt worse about her brother than when he began dating Krista. The union between Krista and Darian was too much for Nadine to bear, and she drew a line in the sand presenting Krista with the ultimatum of choosing between Nadine and her brother. When Krista refused to answer, Nadine abandoned their friendship forging through life and high school and every awkward situation that comes with it friendless and alone, with the exception of her favorite teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson). 

Kelly Fremon Craig crafted a brilliant script, reminiscent of Diablo Cody, with a perfectly conversational tone and wonderfully engaging pop culture references. The most brilliant aspect of the script was that each character was fully developed. It is so rare, especially in a coming-of-age story to have each character so beautifully fleshed out so the audience can understand the film from each perspective. The Edge of Seventeen, especially, was dependent upon being able to see the perspective of each character, as Nadine was often criticized for being self-centered in her belief that she was the only one experiencing problems in regards to the change in her family. The edge of Seventeen was an incredibly relatable story, which is the driving force of a coming-of-age tale; this inherent relatability is in no small part aided by the wonderful acting of the film's lead. Hailee Steinfeld played a perfect lead and was scene stealing and captivating every moment she was on-screen. Kelly Fremon Craig also makes some brilliant directorial choices to allow the audience to see their own similarities to the tale. The fact that the principles attend Lakewood High School reminds me of a line from A Nightmare on Elm Street, "In every town, there's an Elm Street. My hometown in Colorado has a Lakewood High School, and I'm sure, most towns in the U.S. do, as well. The most striking stroke of relatability is the illustration that we are all struggling through our own unique journey, and there is no one among us to save us. Many teenagers believe that when they are an adult they will have all the answers and won't have to struggle through life so much, only to find out that it is only the circumstances with which one struggles with that changes. There is no rule book for understanding given once one becomes an adult, and there are never any easy answers no matter how old we become, the best we can do is find someone that makes the struggle worth it, and navigate life together. 

The Edge of Seventeen was a bit formulaic and predictable in parts, but that is easily forgiven, considering it is a coming-of-age film. The script and cast avoid the predictable hole the film avoided. Whether you were a Darian, who on the surface never met a struggle, or whether you were a Nadine, a self-described "old soul" who always felt out of place in your generation and missed out on the "beer pong ice breakers", there is something in The Age of Seventeen for everyone.

Here's the thing, this movie paints a very authentic portrayal as life as a teenager, and the dialogue is fantastically well written, being funny, cutting and emphatic. The problem is the main character quite literally creates almost all her own drama and problems through being aggressive to everyone around her, and then does it again, again and again.

It's not the teenage angst or the introverted awkwardness (both of which she has in spades and which are reasonable character traits for her to have), it's the fact that she consistently verbal attacks her friend & family, especially when they are trying to apologise or reason with her kindly; and this aggression is often the only thing driving the story. I guess that could be considered perfectly realistic, but it makes everything in the movie so predictable and hard to feel much sympathy for her.

(SPOILERS) Unsurprisingly life gets consistently worse and worse for her and if you stop the movie when she goes to bed five minutes before the end, the main character is exactly the same as at the beginning: selfish, aggressive and with no confidence (so zero character development there). Lo and behold she wakes up a completely different person: confident, polite and kind to all around her - an utterly unbelievable and unrealistic transformation, literally overnight.

So I'd have to say it's a mostly fun movie, with well written dialogue, but a repetitive story and a sloppy tacked-on ending.

Some of the best comedies distinguish the touching hysterical irony of life's joy and tragedy, and celebrate the very best in people in life's paradox. "The Edge of Seventeen" is that and much more. First time Director and Writer Kelly Fremon Craig masterfully navigates that fine line between cleverer than thou, and the reckoning of one's self. Craig captures the natural speak of high school kids without some of the pretense of "Juno". "The Edge of Seventeen" makes you burst out loud with laughter, and touches your heart. Hailee Steinfeld makes this all possible. What a revelation. I remember Hailee from the Coen Brothers' "True Grit" phenomenal. Here she is a star. Steinfeld's performance is funny, vulnerable, and fearless. Hers is one the year's best as well. 

"The Edge of Seventeen" begins somewhere in the middle of the story. Steinfeld's teen drama queen supreme Nadine interrupts her favorite teacher Mr. Brunner played by Woody Harrelson, "I'm gonna kill myself" After a deadpan stare, Mr. Brunner reads Nadine his own drafted suicide note. Too funny. Steinfeld artfully invents Nadine as worthy of love, even when she says the vilest things. She tells literally her only friend in the world Krista (big hearted Hailey Lu Richardson) to choose between her and Nadine's brother Darian (dashing and surprising Blake Jenner). On the ferris wheel ride with Korean American Erwin (good-looking and whimsical Hayden Szeto), the charming animation nerd who is so in love with Nadine, she spews out a comical stereotype rift about of his parents. Then she admits, "All of it was racist." Craig and Steinfeld compassionately walk that fine line with inspired humor. 

At a defining story arc, following a drunken indulgence Nadine weeps to Krista, "I've got to spent the rest of my life...with myself." This is heartbreaking. Her self-loathing is visceral and sad. Growing up in her eyes, older brother Darian was her parents' favorite. Not at all his fault. She constantly clashed with her Mom Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), who just did not 'get her'. Fortunately, her Dad Tom (patient and kind Eric Cooper) was not so much the buffer between Nadine and her Mom, rather the only one who could calm the fear deep in Nadine. As Nadine narrates everything tragically altered when she was 13 years old. She was with her Dad when he unexpectedly passed way. 

Now 17 years old Nadine is a junior in high school and in seemingly self imposed exile with her only friend Krista (Richardson). Darian (Jenner) is the high school teenage godhandsome, smart, popular, and captain of the football team. Mona (Sedgwick) is the overwhelmed single Mom, venturing in the perils of on-line dating, and grateful for raising her perfect son. Nadine yearns for "hot" mysterious loner Nick (Alexander Calvert), who works at the local Pet Land. She indifferently dismisses Erwin (Szeto), who wears the crush for her on his sleeve. History teacher Mr. Brunner (Harrelson) is Nadine's only adult confidant and caustic reality check. 

Hailee Steinfeld is radiant, pretty, and killer smart as Nadine. She wears the uniform skirt and cool shoes as eclectic couture. Outwardly, she would not occur as social pariah. Steinfeld naturally realizes her social outcast with Nadine's merciless words and her tragic refusal to love herself. All are armor to cover the hurt buried within her. 

Waking up from a hangover, Nadine catches Krista 'handling' Darian in a bedroom tryst. Nadine reacts like Nadine, and life spirals out of control. She loses her only friend. Her desired rendezvous materializes and is nearly costlystrikingly and gently envisioned by Craig and Steinfeld. On the bright side she begins to see the wonderful guy in Erwin. Now if she could only just 'shut up' long enough. Nadine's words have a mind of their own: both a curse and an expression of her miraculous being. 

Director and Writer Craig eloquently has Nadine's back. Darian and Krista might have been revealed as selfish jerks. Instead Jenner and Richardson only have unconditional love for Nadine. Jenner is impressively strong in the scene with his Mom. He reminds that though she is the only adult in the house, she calls him when there is trouble. The theater was silent as he and Nadine say, "Good night." Sedgwick's vulnerability strengthens the desperation and spirit of their Mom. Szeto is disarmingly brave and humorously clumsy as Erwin, who really sees Nadine's beautiful soul. Harrelson is subtle comic genius, and anchors "The Edge of Seventeen". As Mr. Brunner, we like Nadine underestimate him. Harrelson's hysterical cynicism masks the most generous soul. He sees the possibility of greatness in Nadine, even though she can't, yet. 

"The Edge of Seventeen" is a wonderful surprise. Hailee Steinfeld is witty and boldly human as Nadine reluctantly emerges as the hero in her own story. Her performance is raw we feel her agony, fear, and joy. We pull for her Nadine to love thine own self. Above all Nadine deserves to love and be loved. We can all see the possibility of this for ourselves as well. "The Edge of Seventeen" is one of the best movies of the year. Thank you, Hailee and Kelly. You've done great.

"The Edge of Seventeen" (2016 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Nadine, a 17 yr. old junior at Lakewood HS. As the movie opens, Nadine is racing the school's hallways to meet with her favorite teacher and tell him "I'm going to kill myself!" The movie then goes back in time to see how we get to this point. After a short look at "Nadine, Age 7" and "Nadine, age 13", where we learn how socially awkward things are for Nadine, but for her strong friendship with her BFF Krista. That brings us to "Nadine, 17". At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is the directing debut for writer Kelly Fremon Craig (who wrote 2009's "Post Grad"). Here, Craig takes another shot at bringing the social awkwardness of being in high school and trying to survive all of the pressures that come with it. When was the last time that I've seen such an awkward teenager, who blurts out "I'm seeing myself and I can't stand it. I gotta spend the rest of my life with myself!". So nothing original here as such, except of course that Nadine is played by none other than Hailee Steinfeld, yes the little girl who was nominated of an Oscar in 2010 for "True Grit" is now grown up into a wonderful young lady which bunches of acting talent. Steinfeld basically carries the movie on her back, and is in virtually every single scene. There is some terrific support from Kyra Sedwick as Nadine's mom and Woody Harrelson as Nadine's teacher, but believe me when I say this is all about Hailee Steinfeld. Last but not least, the movie has a TON of great songs in it (check out the soundtrack).

"The Edge of Seventeen" opened nationally this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people in the entire theater). This movie has not gotten a big marketing push, and it remains to be seen whether it will benefit from strong word-of-mouth. I quite enjoyed it for what it was, a strong vehicle for leading actress Hailee Steinfeld, even if the territory she explores here has been done before and doesn't offer all that much new. If you get a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd suggest you do and draw your own conclusion.

What seems to be the typical "teen" movie of young teenagers in high school ends up being an unusual movie of its kind. I explain: although it is true that the film is a teen movie (it does not deceive anyone), it is also true that it is more complex and adult than it appears at first glance.

It is true that the film has the typical clichés of the genre, I will not lie, but still breaks with the typical dynamics of these films, as it shows a fragile girl and reveals all her fears. The viewer sees how Nadine is with her problems and concerns.

Mention aside its two protagonists: Haliee Steinfeld. It is the ideal actress for the character of Nadine, she is the queen of the film and manages to make her character credible at all times, getting you to empathize with her and make the film an extraordinary work within the genre. Without she, the film probably would not have been just as good. The other character is Woody Harrelson. Seriously, incredible, all the scenes that come out are great. He does a very good role, and the peculiar Nadine-professor couple with their conversations are the best.

To finish, to say that it is a film that is very worthwhile, and that reflects in a superb way the stage that we have all passed, that stage that can be wonderful as well as tragic, that we are misunderstood by all and believe that nobody Understands, that terrifies us and that we have all had to face it with fear to finish knowing ourselves: the adolescence.

100% recommended.

The Edge of Seventeen directed by Kelly Fremon Craig is all about Hailee Stenfeld as Nadine, a 17 yr old girl who feels isolated from others in school because she is too matured for others and too focused on having no one on her side after her only friend , her best friend from early childhood ,Krista(played very well by Haley Lu Richardson)starts dating her good looking brother Darian( Blake Jenner , loved his character in Everybody wants some). Nadine lets out her anger and frustrations about life to her teacher, callous and calm Mr Bruner (Woody Harrelson). Mr Bruner is an excellent listener and understands the turmoil of a 17 yr old female who lost her father at a very young age and now has to cope with life's mole hill problems turned into mountains because of her anger and jealousies. Movie is very pleasant and Hailee Stenfeld has potential to do good roles. I enjoyed conversation between Krista and Nadine after Nadine sees Krista with her brother. And then conversations between Nadine and Mr Bruner about wanting to die. Haley Lu Richardson and Blake Jenner did well as a very nice calm and pleasant couple. Not Oscar worthy for Direction, script, editing but overall a pleasant 1hr44minutes movie.

I just saw an early screening of the movie at a local Cinemark in Texas. It was really good! Had a very unique and fresh feel to it. 

Hailee Steinfeld did a fantastic job selling the role and coming across naturally as a seventeen year old trying to figure out life. She has a natural talent for comedic timing and she was just downright enjoyable to watch in this movie as her character Nadine. While being a immature teenager with next-to-no friends who feels like she has the worst life ever, she surprisingly has a lot of depth. 

Most of her conflicts she causes herself due to her stubborn and self-loathing personality. These things along with her insecure personality make for a realistic approach to a seventeen year old constantly desiring to fit in but not possessing the social abilities to do so. She is not the most likable person but as the movie progresses she slowly starts becoming more tolerable. 

Other conflicts relate to her brother Darian (Blake Jenner) who she is envious and resentful of, best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), and occasionally her mother (Kyra Sedgwick) as well. The cast great job overall and I would have to say there wasn't really any performance from this cast I did not enjoy watching. 

I already mentioned that Hailee nailed her role, but it was Woody Harrelson as Nadine's teacher Mr. Bruner that completely shined in every scene he was in. I could have watched Nadine and Mr. Bruner in a classroom for the entire movie, because their comedic chemistry was such a pleasure to watch. Mr. Bruner is a cynical school teacher that is constantly being bombarded by Nadine with the drama and troubles she goes through on a frequent basis. The scenes with his character always had the theater laughing and he added a great touch to this film as her teacher. 

There were only a couple of issues I had. While Nadine was an very enjoyable character to watch, it was sometimes hard to believe her situation being as bad as it was. Being played by Hailee Steinfeld, she is not exactly unattractive even without make-up. One scene when she dresses up in the movie she is downright stunning, which makes me wonder why she didn't just dress this way all the time? That is instead of complaining about how much she hated her face, voice, etc. They did a good job attempting to dress her in a way that she would not appear as attractive, but you can only do so much as Hailee is naturally attractive and this made her troubles at times unbelievable. 

There would be several scenes in the movie where she would be unable to relate or socialize with others, such as at a party. She would state on several occasions that she hated how insecure she was and hated several of her characteristics, but then scenes later had no issue going swimming alone with a boy for several hours and not appearing socially awkward in the least. These inconsistencies made it a bit hard to narrow down her personality but it did not take away from the entertainment value of the movie. 

Overall I really enjoyed the movie and believe it was very well done. Nothing too serious but definitely a breath of fresh air in this type of genre.

You know that feeling when critics and everybody around you praise some movie and give it the best rating, while you think it's a bowl of poop? Yea...

This is a story of 17 years old girl Nadine. Nadine has problems. Nobody likes her, her brother is a douche bag, she misses her father that's just passed away, her only friend starts dating her brother, her mother doesn't understand her, she's depressed and overall misery and angst.

That's what people responsible for this poop want you to think. All I see is self centered, loud, annoying brat with imaginary problems, no hobbies, terrible personality and true, scary aggression of a raging bull boiling under her skin. She was supposed to be this sad character that audience is supposed to identify with and care about. But I didn't. I was amazed how Nadine kept doing the dumbest things imaginable over and over again, how many old teenage movies plot tricks there are, how every 'person' in this movie is just a plot device to push the 'story' a bit further, how muddled and awkward this bore fest feels.

The only good thing about the movie was in the title of my review. The teacher, played by Woody Harrelson. And by the way, apparently in that school there's only this one guy, because you never see other teachers or our heroine taking some other classes. So our main character is constantly coming to him to throw up her verbal diarrhea about her miserable life and the guy wants to help her, but she doesn't listen, because she's just sad, annoying brat with mental problems.

Few words about R rating. There are 2 categories of R rated movies. The ones that feel natural, where violence and profanity feels like an integral part of a story (Tarantino and Scorsese movies for example) and movies like Edge of Seventeen in which characters just swear a lot. It comes out as fake and forced and it doesn't impress me in the least.

SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING 

The ending is just laughably bad. The change of Nadine's character is one of the most unconvincing in movie history. She just magically turns 180 degrees overnight. Angst is gone, problems don't matter anymore, she's just happy person all of the sudden! She even starts dating this talentless, rich, clearly retarded (can't even construct a proper sentence) Asian guy that was hitting on her for the entire run time of a movie and everything's fine now, happiness is all around, so hooray. I guess.

END OF SPOILERS 

So yea, The Edge of seventeen. A movie about loud, aggressive girl with imaginary problems and poor Woody Harrelson plopped as a cherry on top of a crap cake.

2/10, terrible movie.

Pros

- Great performance - Even greater cast - A good balance between Drama and Comedy (one didn't overshadow the other) - Average yet enjoyable/ meaningful dialogues. - Much more

Cons

- Story telling / Plot

I will go in more details about the plot.

** Rage mode on **

Writter ? WTF bro ? Can you explain how did you end up with Nadine feeling sorry and apologising to her brother for being mad at him for f*cking her best friend ?

How is this acceptable ? Why should Nadine feel happy and "okay" after she practically lost her only friend to her brother ? Because when her friend got in a relationship with her brother we clearly see her overcommitting to her new boyfriend and leaving Nadine behind. How is that okay ? How is that something that nadine should accept and embrace ?

Her brother obviously doesn't care about hurting her feelings, her mother do no understand or support her and on top of that she insults nadine by telling her that her father wouldn't be proud the way she turned out. And after all this cr*p the movie throws at the protagonist, she makes her look like this rebellious teenager that she is mad for no reason at the very end of the movie.

Good job movie. Good job .

If taken purely as a comedy, it's not the funniest film in the world (although it has plenty of very funny moments) but compared to other films of this genre (coming-of- age drama/teen comedy), its one of the best out there.

Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, a teenager with only one friend, struggling to find her way in life. She doesn't get on very well with her family either. Things get worse when her best friend Krista starts dating her brother Darian. 

It is a pretty basic plot and something which we have seen plenty of in the past but with Hailee Steinfeld giving an outstanding performance in the lead role, this film had a likable character that I actually cared for. 

Usually in films like this it's ALL about sex, and although this film did revolve around sex at times, it was more about her character growing as a person, overcoming her struggles, meeting new people & making new friends. There was a lot of depth to Nadine's character and the scenes with Woody Harrelson (teacher) were some of the best moments. 

It was a thoroughly enjoyable film but I wish it had been tied up a bit better at the end. Although you get the general idea with the ending, it would've been nice to see a little more. Maybe there will be a part 2 to carry it on further but if not its still an excellent film which I highly recommend. 

8/10.

To be honest I get the point of the director, but the movie was below average. Nothing to do with Juno or Clueless (as the trailer displayed) Truly being seventeen is not being totally selfish, mean, impolite, irritating and unsympathetic! The story is about a self-adsorbed bitch that in the last 5 minutes figures out that other people have problems and that she should be a better person. Yeah if all the people in the world got so many chances as you did and everyone was so forgiving! Also the fact that sex is such a cool issue for a virgin so much that she sends her crush(who thinks she is a loser with a capital L) a place to do it, had me in laughing tears of what I am seeing. Oh yeah! Sexting is a thing now and everyone has a pool in his house! Even if these things do happen should a movie portray them like that? But the only thing that saved this movie is the actors and the music! Woody Harrelson is amazing as always and the only one that cracked some jokes in this film! Hailee Steinfeld and Kyra Sedgwick do indeed give a very good performance!

Why did I waste my night watching this film? Lets see, "Growing up is hard" and for most parts of Nadines life I agree, bullied and losing your dad is hard. But what for some reason takes the cake is when her friend starts dating her brother. We already know That Nadine is whiny, selfish and annoying, but she just takes it to a whole new level. Not able to act like a normal human being... Until she gets a boyfriend her self. Both Krista and Nadie are the kind of girls that have no life, no personality or anything going for them until they get a man by their side. After that life is peachy, such a great story for young girls. You don't need friends, you don't need friendship, what you need is a man on your arm, and life will sparkle. Your other alternative is to claim that you will kill yourself as the drama queen you are. Besides this movie is formulaic and obvious, I seldom watch movies where I hope the main character will jump in front of a U-Haul. But that is the only thing that could have made this film worth finishing This is the worst film i've seen in 2017.

If only the whole movie were just scenes with Woody Harrelson cracking jokes with the girl. These were the only moments that I really enjoyed and thankfully there were a few of them. Most of the rest of the film was entirely forgettable.

The revenge of Long Duck Dong as Asian Americans get a representative who is a little cooler than the John Hughes slur from 16 Candles. In this version he is stinking rich so that we can accept him a little more because a middle class orgod forbida lower middle class Asian boy would just be unacceptable.

The less actingwait, the less "acting" we see from teenagers in a movie the better. This means no crying scenes and really not much in the way of what you might call real emotion because it's just tedious to watch and completely unconvincing so please, please stop! If you want to make a teen comedy then make a damn comedy and try to limit the DRAMA (James Earl Jones voice over for that last word).

Way too much drama from this over-privileged little spoiled brat. Screw her and all of her teen problems none of which approaches anything even remotely essential to what anyone would consider a decent life. Does she think that everyone is guaranteed a boyfriend and love while in high school? Jesus, grow the F up already. Few kids this age can handle relationships involving sex and everything that goes along with that. I don't think that many university students are ready for that kind of commitment which usually drains the individuality right out of them.

High school is something that almost everyone simply survives so that hopefully you can go on to have something approaching a satisfying life. Most of the people who had these supposedly satisfying relationships at that age went on to marry the slobs they were with or someone exactly like them a few years later. News flash: most of them went on to be the butt of jokes for all of the kids who were dorks in school.

But for any problems I had with rich kids with problems the end was sweet, so there's that.

You know that thing where you see a lot of great reviews and very few mediocre and no bad reviews so you expect the movie to at least be decent but it ends up being completely boring with nothing new or interesting at all in any way even the camera work or direction or acting or setting, and totally clichéd in every scene and very predictable, but you keep watching because you can't believe the reviews would be as wrong as they very obviously are? 

And you know that other thing where you wonder if the world of reviewers and movie watchers that leave reviews were all on drugs or drunk or distracted or didn't watch the movie but gave a review for some reason or another while thinking "hey, people say it is good" and "hey, why don't I compliment it in the same way others have" and then they write their pretentious dribble about what is basically a second-rate after school special from back in the day in America when networks would make those corny "life lessons for teens" melodramas which had nothing of any value in them but showcased young pretty people in the hopes of getting ratings from teens and tween girls who just got home from school and didn't want to watch talk shows or game shows and were bored wit nothing to do? 

And you know that thing were a studio or producer or writers has a checklist of "moments" that they start off in the hopes of getting a hit and then write a script based on that even though every single scene is hackneyed and literally has nothing to offer except some pretty actors speaking like a writer, a bad writer at that instead of anything even remotely fresh, interesting, fun, etc, etc, etc?

Overall a good film. A few laughs, some likable and unlike able characters, good storytelling, but nothing great. 

For higher expectation films of this variety I would recommend Juno, Smart People, or Rocket Science. Still this is entertaining and worth seeing. 

Woody Harrelson Gave a Maverick performance without him the film would have seemed disjointed. Those teen years are awkward, overly dramatic, and they seem exaggerated and one sided. 

There were some good messages in the film.

In entertaining but convincing way you could see trouble on way throw begin teenager. It is very convincing in how easy is for teenager to react extremely silly for some situation, only because it is so much new a unexpected. And sadly I must confess that I many times would not react so good as teacher of this troubled girl.

Enjoyed the humor and performances and the sweet upbeat ending. The only downside was the insufferable behavior of our heroine throughout most of the movie. She was thoroughly unlikable. Also, the improbable casting of Hailee Steinfeld as someone who would be unpopular in high-school with her gorgeous face and super-model body and quirky fashion-sense, was eye-rolling. The writing was excellent as there was not one one-dimensional character in the cast. No one was all bad or all good. This movie turns the typical John Hughes- type cast of characters on their ear: the nerdy Asian with a crush on Nadine, the former friend who abandons her for the popular clique, the dumb jock brother, the neurotic mother, the trusted, unconventional but wise teacher, the handsome entitled and popular unrequited love interest. they are all here...but not here. They are different. Even our lovable but awkward heroine who finally finds her way. Like I said, she is not all that lovable. Hmmmm. I take back what I said about this being a downside. As far as the ending: Yay! this is how Pretty in Pink should have ended.

This is the most stupidest movie I have ever seen. I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this crap. All this girl does is complain. I can't believe it got such high ratings. Makes me think twice about life. There is no moral to the story or even a story line at all.

The Edge of Seventeen follows a young girl in high school who, after learning of her best friend's and brother's romantic relationship, begins to distance herself from other people and ultimately ends up diving into something of a depression. 

The writing here is fantastic. I don't think I've ever seen a teen 'comedy' as relatable and real as this one. The characters talk and act like teenagers, and despite being a male, I was able to relate to most every problem Nadine (the main character) faced to an extent. And the other characters are interesting and, again, relatable. The movie progresses in a way that typically proves to be unpredictable simply because we don't get a lot of movies that capture teen-hood this well, so while I expected some conventional- ism, I got little to none of it. 

The acting is all great. While everyone gives a good performance, Hailee Steinfeld stands above each one. She gives a performance that topples her first Oscar nomination in 'True Grit' without a doubt, yet somehow she got snubbed. Regardless, I think we can all appreciate just how good her performance here was. 

The comedy is really well integrated into the movie. I used the word 'comedy' in quotations earlier because I wouldn't necessarily call it that. It's a teenage drama that has circumstantial comedy in it. It doesn't go out of it's way to make the audience laugh, yet it still manages to capture the hilarity of being a teenager from time to time, and for those who can relate they prove to be very funny parts. 

I don't usually complement a movie for it's pacing because the expectation is that a movie is well-paced. If it's boring, usually that means it failed. If it isn't, well good job movie you met my expectations. And yet, this movie is completely enthralling from beginning to end. Not once was I bored by it, nor did I ever really care to check the remaining run time. In fact, I wished the movie would just keep going on forever by the time it ended. 

If I have but one problem with this movie, it's the way it started. Something about it was just a little shaky. Looking back now I'm not entirely sure why, but it seemed a little off, and I wasn't exactly sure what to think of it.

Overall The Edge of Seventeen is fantastic. The writing, characters, music, pacing, and acting are all just that. And on top of it all, it proves to be very emotionally effective. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.

Much of the positive buzz about "The Edge of Seventeen" came from positive comparisons to films like "The Breakfast Club" or "16 Candles". As I'm always up for movies that describe the emotional state of the teen years (provided they aren't gross-out/sex comedies...I don't care for those all that much), and am a big fan of Hailee Steinfeld, I decided to give this one a try. What I found is that while the film is most certainly authentic (i.e. seems to be true to what teens go through these days), I can't say it was really all that entertaining either. It just lacked that emotional investment towards the characters that one needs to truly fall in love with a film.

For a basic plot summary, "Edge of Seventeen" tells the story of Nadine (Steinfeld), a teen girl who doesn't fit in with anyone in her school. The only way she wards off utter depression is that best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) always has her back and teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) proves to be a great sounding board for her problems. Things don't get much better at home, as Krista resents her super-popular brother Darian (Blake Jenner) and mother Mona (Kyra Sedgwick) struggles to function after the death of her husband. A chain of complicated events/emotions is put into play when Krista and Darian become a pair, prompting Nadine to really examine many different aspects of her life.

First and foremost when evaluating "Edge of Seventeen" is the fact that this movie is completely and utterly carried by Steinfeld. She is a true acting talent (and has proved as much in previous films like "True Grit" and "Pitch Perfect 2") and dare I say without her presence this film may have been a complete dog. Even when the beats seem predictable or the acting isn't up to the highest standards, Steinfeld can carry both the light-hearted and emotional scenes. The only times I was emotionally invested in this film whatsoever were when she was front and center.

Unfortunately, there are just too many other problems that plague this movie to really give it anything higher than a middling rating. For example...

-Richardson's Krista looks like she is going to be a great character...but then is basically abandoned about halfway through the film.

-Blake Jenner is cast perfect for his role in terms of physical appearance and stature, but I felt that perhaps his acting chops weren't what was needed for the part. I won't go so far as to call him a "poor actor", but a big part of family dynamics on the film center on him, and I was wholly underwhelmed when that was the case.

-After the first 30-40 minutes (in which I was quite engaged), the rest of the way felt rather predictable and uninspiring. In other words, the setup was far, far better than the resolution.

I realize that it is perhaps difficult for me (as an over-30 male) to fully identify with this movie, but I wasn't a teen in the 80s either and I still love "Breakfast Club". What that movie had that this one lacked was a such of dramatic flair, not being afraid to really break down what was going on in the minds of the characters. I feel like in "Edge of Seventeen", the focus was more on "authenticity" (making sure the look/feel of things seemed right) than "dramatic entertainment".

So, while I think that the target audience (teens) will like this one more than I, I also don't think this will stand the test of time as a "standout teen flick", either. If you value authenticity and love to be totally immersed in the daily life of an era, this one may peak your interest, but in terms of really high drama it might fall a bit flat.

Fast, without being anxious, intelligent without being presumed, humorous without being silly and dramatic without being melodramatic. With an impeccable performance of each of the members, especially Hailee Steinfeld who stands out amazingly above the rest. With a way to relate the story in an understandable and effective way, where each step is destined towards a very intelligent end, but also nothing spectacular, and at least that's where I have the one but the film ... the NO conversation between Nadine and Krista, it's okay, our protagonist talks to her brother, she is relieved and it is possible to make sense of the actions that this girl was doing, but I miss that conversation with her best friend, maybe the time is very hard in editing (I really do not know If there was any scene filmed or written with respect to that conversation) but I miss that, still very well worn, I like that sense of humor where the drama can draw a smile, human relations more simple and bearable, in the end is part of life itself.
