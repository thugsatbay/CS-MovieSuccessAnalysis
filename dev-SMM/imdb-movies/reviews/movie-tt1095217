### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This film is not at all what I expected from Herzog - I haven't laughed so much in a long time during a movie. What we've got here is an over-the-top, crazy ride with the best Nic Cage in years. Funny little anecdote on the side (as told by the director, Werner Herzog): when Cage asked for advice on how to best approach his role, Herzog told him to go with "evil is bliss". Cage obviously obliged - and the result is hilarious. 

This film got a lot of negativity because apparently, people expected a serious, dark drama (knowing the original, I did, too). Well, Herzog had other plans: this is a wickedly funny black comedy that borders on satire. Fantastic acting by all involved, inventive camera and just one hell of a ride. Herzog's most entertaining film to date and Cage's best performance in ages. 9 stars out of 10.

One thing you can always count on when you go into a Werner Herzog movie is that you can always expect to find a story surrounding a very bizarre individual. With Bad Lieutenant, I saw both Herzog and Nicholas Cage in a new light, or rather a new darkness. Labeled as a black comedy, there should be more emphasis on 'black' than on 'comedy'. The film bears a strong resemblance to the thematically surreal and contrived nature of a Coen Brothers film, but the difference is that this one is more character driven than plot driven. More specifically, this is a film that lives on one performance. Nicholas Cage for the first time in a while has done something worthy of recognition, possibly even award worthy.

He plays New Orleans cop Terence McDonagh, recently promoted to Lieutenant. The film follows his latest homicide investigation. Due to a back problem and a drug addiction he is grumpy and unstable. He is sort of an anti- American hero, and the film concludes on a very bizarre note but clever anti- conventional/Hollywood manner.

Though not Herzog's best, it is certainly one worth watching. With each film I see from him, past or present he continues to intrigue me, but I think in this case, it might be Nicholas Cage who deserves the most credit.

I just watched this at London Film Festival & went in expecting to hate it as I loved the original. But I have to say, the film is excellent, certainly Cage's best film & best performance since Leaving Las Vegas. Herzog has done a brilliant job & the film stands on it's own, apart from the Ferrara film. I won't spoil bits by mentioning them, but the film has several stand-out memorable scenes worth the price of admission alone. Herzog has always said that training for making films is 'life' not a stuffy film studies class etc. If you're familiar with his work or sensibilities, you'll get even more insight into how cool this guy is after watching this film. I look fwd to watching it again when it releases and getting the DVD!!

This wildly entertaining police drama, which takes place in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, begins with a police officer being decorated and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant after bravely saving the life of a prisoner who'd been trapped in a flooded cell. The officer's injuries leave him with chronic back pain and his dependency on the painkiller Vicodin soon develops into a powerful addiction. His situation then worsens when he starts using cocaine and heroin in ever increasing quantities as he degenerates into behaviour which becomes reckless, immoral and criminal. This man's experience is harrowing and extremely disturbing so it's something of a surprise to find that his story is told in a style which is not only dramatic but also, at times, extremely funny.

Newly promoted Police Lieutenant Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage) is put in charge of an investigation into the execution type killing of a Senegalese family of illegal immigrants and information he receives from a known drug user soon confirms that the family were involved in dealing on a local drug lord's territory. This puts McDonagh on the trail of gang leader Big Fate (Alvin "Xzibit" Joiner).

In the course of his investigation, McDonagh loses a teenage witness and in an effort to get the boy's grandmother to disclose his whereabouts, goes to the nursing home where she works, holds a gun to her head and threatens to kill one of the residents (an old lady with a serious respiratory condition) but he draws a blank as it transpires that the witness has emigrated to England.

McDonagh's girlfriend Frankie (Eva Mendes) is a drug addicted prostitute with whom he shares his drugs. When he goes to see her in a Biloxi hotel room and finds that a client has physically assaulted her, he threatens the man and takes $10,000 from him. This leads to a bigger problem as the man is connected to some gangsters and one of them demands $50,000 from McDonagh and gives him only two days to pay up.

McDonagh is also beset by other problems as his bookie is demanding early settlement of his gambling debts and his alcoholic father is busy drinking himself to death. To make matters worse, McDonagh is then relieved of his duties and sent to work in the evidence room as punishment for the way he'd treated the old lady in the nursing home. McDonagh responds to this indignity by joining forces with Big Fate in a move, which not only solves his problems with the gangster but also provides him with an opportunity to bring his original investigation to a satisfactory conclusion albeit by an extremely unorthodox method.

This movie features an amazing amount of unrestrained craziness and eccentricity and some real laugh out loud moments. McDonagh's use of narcotics often causes him to hallucinate and on some occasions he sees things such as iguanas or a man's spirit break-dancing after he'd been shot dead! Nicolas Cage is ideal for the part of the corrupt cop who uses a lucky crack pipe, as his talent for acting unhinged and hysterically funny at the same time is absolutely extraordinary. The intensity that he achieves in the role which enables him to convey so powerfully, the depths of his character's suffering and determination, is also very impressive.

The worst feature of the movie is its title which is too long and misleading as it suggests that it's a remake or a sequel to Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" (1992). More importantly though, its visual style and the inclusion of Johnny Adams' wonderful rendition of "Release Me" add even more enjoyment to what already is an extremely entertaining account of McDonagh's insane journey through drugs, depravity and unconventional crime fighting.

Herzog's popularity, and some might say his entire career, came from his long partnership with the incomparable firestorm of an actor Klaus Kinski. In Herzog's own words, their "joint derangement must have converged to create great art". Whether Herzog was referring to Kinski's explosive fury on screen or something more insidious such as the real life allegations that Kinski sexually molested his daughter from age 5 to 19, we don't know. My point is that Herzog had the ability to draw on Kinski's madness & evil to create some very memorable films about precisely that: madness & evil ("Aguirre", "Fitzcarraldo", "Nosferatu"). After Kinski died, Herzog's films were considerably less explosive although he still pushed those dark themes.

Here in "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans", once again we get the familiar themes of madness and depravity, and although it doesn't quite strike that horrifying Kinski vein, it has moments of brilliance thanks to an excellent acting job by Nicolas Cage.

We also get, at the core, a well-written story by William Finkelstein who wrote extensively for gritty TV crime dramas like "NYPD Blue", "Law & Order" and "L.A. Law".

It's the story of a rogue New Orleans cop who is investigating a series of murders while he himself flirts with depravity as he battles with drug-related issues and moral degradation. What's important to note is the familiar Herzoggian theme of madness and the thrill of of evil on the human soul. Cage plays a detective who, on the surface, is a cool-tempered & intelligent hero, a likable guy really. But he begins to descend into depravity, and there are 1 or 2 moments of outright sickening behavior (such as falsely arresting, then having sex with a woman in exchange for letting her go). This is not a film for the morally faint of heart. It is intended to morally shock us, and that it does.

But what's interesting is the way Cage's portrayal remains heroic (the good guy), unlike Kinski's villainous portrayals (the monster). In the past, Herzog-Kinski films presented us with a vision of evil which thrilled us in a guilty way, as if we're passing a gory car wreck. Here we have the much more comfortable yet equally challenging perspective of watching a good guy who can't resist the thrill of depravity. So from a safer distance from evil, we can watch the story unfold.

I don't know if it's that subtle thematic difference, or simply the idea that Nicolas Cage is not an alleged incestuous child abuser, that made me enjoy this film in a lighter way. I should note that this film also carries much more humor and playful dark comedy than any of Herzog's other films I've seen. In the 2nd half of the film, Cage's frenetic portrayal of a coked-up, cracked-up drug fiend was done a comedic air... along with some hilarious surreal visuals & music (the break dancing scene had me laughing out loud).

Ultimately, we get a "morality tale" which is very gritty, very comic, very morally disturbing, and yet it doesn't leave us with a sick feeling like certain other films which explore the evil nature of human beings. In fact, with the exception of the disturbing sexual bribe scene, "Bad Lieutenant" could almost be watched as a dark comedy from start to finish. It's a different approach for Herzog, one which would be great to see him explore in the future.

Final note worth mentioning, since Herzog's early films were notorious for having real animal abuse/killing that may disturb some viewers: Yes, there is a scene of a dead alligator with her guts spilled out, and yes it is real. But according to the DVD extras, the alligator carcass was purchased from (presumably) New Orleans animal control because it was a "nuisance alligator eating people's pets and stuff." I think there was an American Humane "no animals harmed" disclaimer at the end of the movie.

-No spoilers here...

A darkly-twisted, hilariously-unhinged,, satirically-farcical story of one man doing what's right... for himself.

A lot of debate is centered around whether this film is connected to Abel Ferrara's Film from the 1980's. Save some time and trust me on this, the answer is NO, IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO IT AT ALL..

Many people are divided about this reinvention of the cops and robbers, good guy bad guy genre... Some love it, some don't.. et all.

It is one of those films that, while obviously you have to see it for yourself, I believe many will use as a benchmark to judge another persons sense of humour... Maybe even intellect.

It's just that good!!!

For me, it's a seriously clever and uniquely funny crossover between the independent and mainstream style of cinema. 

I have not seen NicCage act better or as well for a long, long time. You do not need to be a follower of the cult of Herzog to enjoy this film either. 

It's instantly accessible to anyone with a twisted laugh and an evil grin... Mua..Hahaha... All jokes aside, if I was ever PC it would be high on my list of guilty pleasures(Luckily that's never been a problem, though). It's one of the few films out of thousands I've seen that I make an effort to recommend to people I don't even know...

-Take time out and enjoy the great Werner Herzog directing hilariously good fun out of the darkest corners in our reality...

If you don't like it, at least you'll know you're one of them... :)

Nic Cage is a living, breathing cartoon character of a personality and actor as well, and the best filmmakers seem to grasp intuitively that the best way to have Nic in a movie--the only way, really--is to first be sure they've got for him an appropriately comical, ironic, melodramatic or surreal story. This one happens to be all four, to a serious degree. It also features compelling and offbeat relationships and unexpected, wild action, all of it slyly hypnotic and even gripping. It'd be fair to describe this film as a tense crime drama that's regularly relieved by comical gags if it weren't for the fact that the perfectly timed humorous beats are so damn hysterical--and so weird. The outrageously absurd, profoundly wacky moments so thoroughly overwhelm the more somber, dark and disturbing moments--not in quantity but in sublime intensity--that they thoroughly dislodge us from any dependable emotional or psychological perch and it's hard to know with any confidence from instant to instant what we're expected to feel or think, which, apparently, is very much intentional. We're being toyed with, and not coyly but blatantly, maybe even wickedly.

The director, Werner Herzog, is a connoisseur of contradiction and paradox as he's eloquently and masterfully demonstrated in many of his films, such as the bleakly absurd "Aguirre, the Wrath of God," or the incredibly preposterous "Fitzcarraldo," or the often delightfully campy "Nosferatu the Vampyre" where subtle humor is so effectively collided against genuinely poignant drama. But this one's on a whole different level, and it's entirely the fault of Nic Cage and his nearly demented, turbocharged performance as an increasingly crazed, spiraling out of control, drug addicted crooked cop.

As his character's condition deteriorates and his affliction and corruption possess him to the core not only does Nic begin to distort his appearance and posture to match his deepening pathology but his voice as well becomes increasingly warped as it grows more high pitched and nasal, as though the mounting stress is compressing him like a squeeze toy. It's beyond silly but it somehow works, at least on the level of his character's distorted, perverted perspective. 

Often the soundtrack is emphatically offbeat, quirky and disruptive, working in counterpoint to the pace and tone of the unfolding action, but the musical score might then quickly shift to more traditional rhythms more in sync with the apparent mood of the scene which only renders those moments all the more unsettling. It's a very subversive technique inciting a creeping, crawling uncertainty deep within the subconscious, at a primal level; a sincerely surreal experience punctuated so ridiculously, so blatantly by the hallucinogenic appearances of those damn freaky iguanas. So freaky... 

It's disorienting--in the best way--to be so constantly jerked, jolted and yanked around by a movie, especially when it's all being done so well, so confidently. Werner Herzog has crafted a sincerely bizarre, wild ride; a rare and special cinematic experience that will appeal to--and thrill--aficionados of superior, if idiosyncratic storytelling. Very much recommended above all else for its uniquely unorthodox, unhinged vibe.

I'm not very sure if I could consider this as an actual remake of Abel Ferrara's 1992 film, "Bad Lieutenant" (Since both movies have almost no similarities in what concerns to plot, character and development)so I won't make any comparison between those two films: Instead of that, I prefer to say that I really liked this film. For me, it was an excellent combination of black comedy and suspense, being one of the most original and most bizarre crime thrillers ever made.

I must say that I haven't seen many Werner Herzog's films (Just "Rescue Dawn", "My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?" and this one) but this film was my favorite of those three movies. The direction of this film was pretty solid, and even the strangest situations that happen in this film are delivered in a pretty interesting way.

In this movie Nicolas Cage does one of his best performances, playing a complete opposite character of his usual roles, and I have to admit that he did an extraordinary work here.

"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans" not an ordinary cop drama. It is something much better than that, being fresh, unique and original. My advice to those who are planning to see this movie is to don't expect a serious, gritty movie, but instead something quite surreal, that could be pretty dark, but very funny and strange at the same time. For me this combination of seriousness, dark comedy and weirdness was something pretty effective.

After Katrina, police sergeant Terence McDonagh rescues a prisoner, hurts his back in the process and earns a promotion to lieutenant plus an addiction to cocaine and painkillers.

Six months later, a family is murdered over drugs; Terence runs the investigation. His drug-using prostitute girlfriend, his alcoholic father's dog, run-ins with two old women and a well-connected john, gambling losses, a nervous young witness, and thefts of police property put Terence's job and then his life in danger.

He starts seeing things. He wants a big score to get out from under mounting debts, so he joins forces with drug dealers.

After a few years in the wilderness of decidedly dodgy movies, Cage is back in his full blown, over the top best (he probably hasn't been this maniacal since face/off)under the supervision of genius Herzog.

any similarities to the Ferrera movie is in title alone, as this really has nothing to do with that film. It appears that the titular character is on the road to redemption in this film, doing something good in the beginning, and being punished for it throughout the film.

We meet some bizarre characters throughout the movie, and ironically the only 'normal' characters in the film are the perpetrators of the film. Cages accent changes almost halfway through the film for some bizarre reason, and his limp and gait becomes more prominent toward the third act.

Connotations toward hallucinations and drug taking are rife throughout, and sometimes we are viewing the world through Neils eyes, rather than that of the viewer.

Herzog makes brilliant use of camera work and the sets, and the cinematography is sometimes very psychedelic.

For a film that is so downbeat at times, the ending is surprisingly uplifting and happy, Neils path to redemption appears complete, despite the strange ending.

With nods to Lynch and DePalma, this is one of those movies, that will become depressingly more popular as time goes on, rather than when initially released.

Unmissable.

Very well made with a few quirky effects I loved 'Iguana-cam' particularly (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). But the thing that stands out most about this picture is the performance of Nicolas Cage as Terence McDonagh; they say for every three duds there's one outstanding one and believe me, this is well worth a look! He's really great in this. I also thought Eva Mendes did an excellent job as Frankie Donnenfield. Honourable mentions go to; Val Kilmer, who I thought was underused as Stevie Pruit, Xzibit as gangster, Big Fate and Jennifer Coolidge as Genevieve.

The combination of Cage's excellent performance and the direction of Herzog works a treat (for me). I know the film failed to impress that much at the American box office and I think it may be because it perhaps went a little far in showing McDonah's decline. I did feel the events leading up to the ending seemed a little rushed; having spent so much time showing him reach that point. Over all though, I thought it was rather good and deserved a better reception than it got (For me), RECOMMENDED.

Stories about corrupt cops are older than cinema itself. So it takes some real talent and an interesting setting to inject some energy into the genre. Thank goodness for an innovative director and an actor Like Nicolas Cage. Here he resurrects some of the Cage we saw in Leaving Las Vegas. His Lt. Terry McDonagh is such a corrupt and self-destructive man, yet there is a very real and likable humanity boiling just underneath the surface. We witness this man stumble into one personal disaster after another while he still attempts to solve a multiple drug-related murder. Just when you think he can't sink any lower, he not only survives but he also keeps getting promoted.

When we first meet Cage's character in the opening scene, it already looks like he's far from an honest cop. He and a fellow detective (Val Kilmer) are the last cops left at the police station as flood waters from Hurricane Katrina are rising and seem sure to drown a pleading prisoner in his cell. It seems the two are just going to place a thousand dollar bet on what the coroner will one day list the man's time of death as being. Then suddenly, Cage seems to get a dose of mercy and dives into the brown snake-filled sludge to rescue the man. The act gets him a promotion and a commendation for valor. But it also injures his back and basically baptizes him in the slime of the city of New Orleans.

Within six months after being prescribed pain killers for his back, Cage is a hardcore drug user. He preys on small time criminals to steal their drugs. He smokes crack and weed with dangerous suspects. He uses all manner of intimidation to get the information he needs to solve crimes. He blackmails a college football player to throw a game since he has a huge gambling debt. The list goes on. All the while we still sense there is good in him. At one point he cannot pin the multiple murder on the hoodlum who obviously did it. So what does he do? He goes into business selling drugs with the man! Pressed by the hood if Cage was ever even interested in solving the murder, Cage claims he never was. But we know this isn't true. And Cage makes sure justice is eventually done.

There is so much to like about this film, and first and foremost the main strength is that it isn't a strict corrupt cop formula. There are so many detours and surprises where we continue to be amazed at the sordid company Cage keeps. You'll howl with laughter as Cage excitedly smokes crack with some of the foulest hoodlums imaginable. You'll stare with wonder at some scenes. Is Cage just paranoid, or is there really a pair of iguanas on the table next to him during a stakeout? And how about the POV shot from an alligator after its mate has been splattered on a highway. The film will not be for all tastes, but has few flaws. Maybe Eva Mendes is just too beautiful to play Cage's hooker/girlfriend. Maybe the film meanders and wraps up too many loose ends in a truncated fashion. But I liked it anyway, and fans of Cage will love it. Its good to see him doing something edgy again after some overly commercial recent roles. 8 of 10 stars.

I don't really know what people see in this film, all I find is a script desperate for direction. The movie is purportedly about a New Orleans cop (Nicolas Cage) attempting to solve the murder of an illegal immigrant family in aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Cage also happens to be addicted to drugs (cocaine, heroin, and marijuana), is a compulsive gambler, a rapist, a thief, and a liar. Each of these traits is highlighted in a separate storyline that has nothing to do with the original plot of the film. In fact the stories become so numerous that the plot itself is all but lost amongst them.

There is no one to root for in this film, everyone is a scumbag. In that way it reminded me of Monster's Ball, but the characters weren't quite as unlikeable, but they were unlikeable enough to make me wonder why I was even watching the film. Cage is over the top and basically unbelievable as a character. To make things worse on a few occasions, in order to create a sense of the drug addled world Cage lives in, the director gives us close up shots of reptiles that are so jarring ( full lens flare and distortion, perspective imbalance, grainy footage) and out of place that it took me right out of the movie and into a college film class. I know I'm watching a movie, don't remind me.

The movie is also goofy in other respects as well. In one of the final scenes everything comes together for Cage, he wins his football bet for the week, his record gets cleared up, the crooks get captured, the legbreakers get off his back, and it all happens in the span of about 30 seconds. I was reminded of the scene in Men in Black when Tommy Lee Jones uses his memory messer-upper to make all of Will Smith's coworkers compliment him on his great work. I couldn't take the movie seriously, and perhaps it didn't want me to, but it didn't do a very good job of letting me enjoy it.

It took me some time into the film to actually figure out how it worked. Because, starring Nic Cage, I would have expected it to be some kind of drama or crime film. It isn't though, and I realized that only half way in.

I don't really remember which scene exactly it was that gave me that eye opener, but I believe it was when Nic had to give up his gun to internal affairs and complained to his father, in a seriously depressed manner, that "a man without a gun is not a man". At which point I was bound to realize that this film was in fact a variant of a parody, albeit very subtle as such.

I mean, things just connected. The over-sized Dirty Harry style weapon. How he carried it, sticking out there out of his pants. And, after all, how he effectively used it. Namely just for show and never really shooting anybody.

And as much as the "man without a gun" bit connected with it's context to form a neat irony, all the other stuff did too. At which point the enjoyment really started, also of the first half of the film in hindsight. Because, as said, pieces fell into place.

Apart from the delicious humor, I found the story line to be sufficiently complex to keep me entertained and wondering about the various characters and their motives. On top of that, I felt truly enchanted by some lovely poetry in form of a "fish dream" theme which get's picked up at various points in the film, as the "silver spoon" theme does in quite nice ways.

So altogether, for anybody not knowing what to expect, this isn't an art house film. It isn't an action, crime or drama film either. It's a very subtle satire, maybe best compared to a toned down Bunuel film if such a thing existed, but with Hollywood entertainment style production features. Very likable, really.

Incidentally, there's apparently been some heat about this being an alleged remake of Ferrara's film. Well, it isn't apart from the very rough plot basics. Otherwise, those films totally differ in style and meaning. Each of them doesn't take away anything from the other.

One of Nicolas Cage's best performances. Extremely impressive. Didn't know this movie existed until it showed up on Encore and was it ever worth watching. Herzog and Cage give us a character that I both identified with and hated. The script is brilliant and has no correlation with the earlier movie which starred Harvey Keitel. It is an original which stands on its own. The plot is complex. Cage's character, Sargant Terence McDonagh, is established immediately as capable of heroic acts and is promoted to lieutenant. We learn that McDonagh is not all good guy in stages. First we learn about the drug addictions and later about the gambling addiction. This is one of those movies which will be recognized for its true brilliance about 30 years from now, like Scarface is now.

What bothered me most about this movie was that after the movie I felt no care that I had watched it. It didn't entertain me during the movie and afterwards I picked out the parts of the film that made my experience even worse. The fact that detective Terence McDonagh got a bad back by jumping into the water. How then could he save the drowning inmate? These two pieces of the plot are the keystones to the rest of the film and it just could not happen. 

Whether the movie was meant to be a combination of imaginations of the detective I do not know but unlike a "A Beautiful Mind" the renderings of the fictions in an altered reality come across as work of a six year old holding a camera. Not a crafted piece of deception which the mind is readily able to do. Just irritating to watch. 

I personally do not think that the people who created this movie really cared about making this movie. Every plot twist was created not out of intrigue or imagination but out of convenience. The biggest nail in the coffin of why I think this movie was not created out of care was the editing. Five, Six, Seven or more times I saw the overhead microphone come into the shot including the shadow of the mike on one occasion. If I was to view the DVD in the future would I see crew as well- it would not surprise me in the least. 

The police cruiser of detective Terence McDonagh driving to confront the young couples leaving the night club obviously has no right side mirror- the stump of where it is attached is clearly there but no mirror. Very disappointing to say the least. Others have mentioned overacting and to me the simplistic characters show a lack of care in creating a film which on its surface was meant to be something of substance. It certainly was not that at all. What an awful film.

Many will look at this and will think that it is an action thriller about a cop trying to solve the murders of 5 people in New Orleans and that is a basic idea of what the film is about. 'Trying' is right word to use; Nicolas Cage's characters is deeply flawed and is taking drugs to ease his back pain, which he got for saving a prisoner in a flooded prison. He has no interest in bringing the people responsible to justice.

It is difficult to describe what happens in the film because it is so different from other films that I have seen. If you have seen Werner Herzog's other films then you will like this maybe not as much as some of his other films but there is a lot to like. Nicolas Cage gives a fantastic performance and is clearly back on form after the likes of Next, National Treasure and The Wicker Man. The rest of the cast also do a good job but the focus is on Cage. The chosen location of New Orleans suits the film well and the cinematographer does a good job showing it. The script writer must also be credited for providing the film with interesting pieces of dialogue even though its difficult to tell what was improvised and what was not. 

This film is not for everyone though since the trailer shows it as a more of an crime thriller than a drama. If you are not a fan of art house films or films that have an offbeat sense of humor then you might not enjoy it as much as those who do. Those who watch this film and liked it will be able to find plenty of things about the film that represent something else. There is clearly more to this film than what is happening on the surface.

If you do choose to watch this film then go in with an open mind as there is a lot to like but I can't guarantee that it will be for everyone.

Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans Film Review & Summary In Werner Herzog's "Bad Lieutenant," there are a lot of iguanas. We are first introduced to them after a heated conversation between Nicolas Cage's Terrence and and one of his peers. Here, the iguana is filmed in a fashion that somewhat resembles a cross between documentary and horror. The iguana crawls slowly but surely, building up this cunning, malignant air about it, kind of like the shark in "Jaws." To Terrence, the iguanas are the real villains in the movie. In post Katrina New Orleans, Terrence and his partner, played by Val Kilmer, walk around a flooded complex. There they notice that a prisoner is trapped in his cell in which there is seldom any breathing space. The two bet on how long it will take for him to drown. The prisoner pleas but Cage tells him that he has cotton underpants on. Eventually, Cage jumps in and saves him. Unfortunately for him, he's going to experience back pain for the rest of his life. He develops an addiction for painkillers, and later for a variety of illegal drugs, ranging from Mary Jane to Cocaine. The rest of the film centers on Cage getting into deep sh*t with various different people or just hanging out with his girlfriend, a character that's just been put into this film for the hell of it, giving off a very inert performance by Eva Mendes. You will notice that things go either really well for him or really terribly.

Herzog didn't watch Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant. It's no surprise then that this film, though it shares (roughly) the same plot, has a completely different tone. Whereas, the 1992 version was a macabre character study of a tortured soul, this is a black comedy, in which all the things which haunted Harvey Keitel's character merely annoy Terrence, and in which the most disturbing scenes turn to comedy gold. The score, though awfully composed and cheesy as hell, just gives this light-hearted feel to the movie. Take for instance the scene in Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant in which the lieutenant pulls over two girls for speeding. He forces one of them to show him her backside, and the other to fellate the air, as it were. In Herzog's Bad Lieutenant, Terrence pulls over a man and his girlfriend. He searches them for drugs, confiscates the drugs, and proceeds to have sex with the girl in an upright position, her boyfriend watching all the while. While he is in the act, Terrence asks the girl whether she has had a disturbing childhood, in a ridiculous accent. The line "(did he) molest you?" stands out, simply because of the uncalled for emphasis on the 'o.'

With the exception of the aforementioned iguanas, there are a number of ways in which Herzog portrays Terrence's drug addiction. Herzog is one of the few directors, the others being Terry Gilliam, Edgar Wright, and Wes Anderson, who manages to use only a camera to find comedy. At first it might seem like the fact that there are manifold cuts even while Terrence is in the middle of a sentence is a mistake, though this is there to give this trippy (trippy? yeah trippy) feel to the movie. Another technique Herzog utilizes is a seemingly misguided use of the zoom. Yet another is when nearly the whole frame is out of focus. Beside this, it should be said that the cinematography, especially the use of color, in this film is exceptional.

Nic Cage is a neo Klaus Kinski: He's a raving lunatic. This film (no, not "The Wicker Man" or "Raising Arizona" or "Vampire's Kiss") is the bog standard example of this. He confiscates oxygen tubes from old ladies, he steals another policeman's nude photos, he sees a guy's soul dancing even after he's just been killed. What great chemistry between two of the craziest people in the industry: Herzog and Cage! What a film!

The images of New Orleans were stark, beautiful and true to life. I did not realize that this was a black comedy until midway into the film, which was a pleasant surprise. Terrence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage) has recently been promoted to lieutenant after Hurricana Katrina. He injures his back at work after rescuing an inmate from a sure death after rising flood waters. After this pivotal event the Lieutenant goes on a downward emotional spiral and begins to hallucinate and behave eccentrically due to his mounting drug use. If this took place six months after the Storm, how can there still be flood waters? Maybe this was for theatrical and symbolic effect. Cage gives a wonderful performance here, drug ticks and all. 

Terrence is in a relationship with Frankie Donnenfield, a prostitute (Eva Mendes). They both use drugs and in a strange way, console eat other. Cage and Mendes have great chemistry, and their love story is very credible. Who else can love a corrupt yet strangely likable drug addicted and now partially disabled cop? Even though Frankie is a prostitute, Herzog does not dehumanize her and never shows her at "work". Instead, he focuses on the emotional and physical effects and consequences of prostitution without condemning her.

As can be expected, almost all of the characters are morally corrupt with the exception of Binnie's grandson, Daryl, a witness to the homicide of a Senegalese drug dealer. This is New Orleans, The Big Easy after all. The film's depiction of New Orleans is spot on considering that it's a Hollywood production. I appreciate the fact that most of the characters did not affect the New Orleans dialect unless they could pull it off well or were Southern themselves. These just happened to be people living in New Orleans for whatever reason.

Genevieve (Jennifer Coolidge), Pat McDonagh's (Terrence's father), is an alcoholic like her husband and is always "sh!t face on beer". Frankie comes to stay with them after being marked by a john with mob ties. Genevieve and Frankie get into a "fight". Before I saw the ending, I thought that this fight scene was weak and almost funny. Afterwards, I understood why the fight was meant to not be convincing; Genevieve dopes in addition to her beer habit and Frankie doesn't have the face nor nerve to really beat Genevieve up for "disrespecting" her.

A big part of the movie is devoted to the capture of suspected murderer and drug dealer, Big Fate (rapper Xhibit). He allegedly killed the Senegalese man and his family. Big Fate formed part of the N.O. ecosystem.

The one character that I do not see a point to was Stevie (Val Kilmer). He's been in several great films, but here he is just a hanger on.

The ending's funny and happy, strangely enough. Suddenly, all of the bad things that made the film "dark" at first turn happy. I had a very good time watching the film and appreciate it for what it is.

7.5/10. I set myself up to not like this, the original with Harvey Keitel had a lasting impression on me when I watched it all those years ago as a student. However, this version only very loosely resembles the original. I think this was a wise move, to try and re-create it would have been a travesty. Instead we get the role reinvented by Nicholas Cage, and it is a quite stunning performance. Totally OTT - the stoop is so bad I keep expecting Cage to launch into Ricarhd III at any moment, the way he refers to one of the drug gang as "G" followed by a snort several times is just comic genius. The scene in the retirement home left me open mouthed - I didn't know whether to laugh or be shocked, one of the most amazing single scenes in a film I've seen for a long, long time. There is comedy in this and it is no where near as dark as the original, in the end I wanted to hate the film, but I loved it!!

Is this a remake of the Bad Lieutenant the 1992 Drama starring Harvey Keitel and directed by Abel Ferrara, that I loved so much? Only if you're a Hollywood producer with your head up your ass. Calling this film a sequel is like sticking The Deer Hunter in front of any Vietnam themed movie made since. Granted it's a story about a corrupt police office and the comparisons stop there. In several interviews Warren Herzog has said as much. I'm paraphrasing but he stated he hated the idea but the suits loved it and he wanted to make the movie. In my opinion just one more reason to proudly wear my "suits suck" T-shirt out on the town.

Nicolas Cage plays a police officer immediately after Hurricane Katrina. His reluctant decision to swim in rising filthy storm water to save an abandoned prisoner from his cell has three immediate effects upon his life. He injures his back severely, he gets promoted to Lieutenant and he gets a lifelong prescription of vicodin to deal with the pain. Out of the three it's the vicodin that proves the most troublesome. He soon becomes addicted and that leads him to start cutting corners to secure more drugs to deal with his pain and addiction. 

I know what you're thinking, Nicolas Cage, that guy has never seen a script he doesn't like. While I will admit many of his choices as of late have been perplexing and his acting can me ham fisted at times this is not the case in Port of Call New Orleans. Cage gives a stunning performance as a cop in pain both mentally, physically and emotionally. This performance is vintage Cage its so refreshing to see him bring his considerable talents to bear. 

Herzog for his part delivers his special kind of weird in full force. He leads the viewer by the nose only to spin this predictable tale of self destructive cop gone bad on its head. His added elements of iguana cam, dead men dancing and Hollywood happy ending will leave you wondering exactly what the hell is going on. Are these elements of symbolism to be interpreted, drug filled illusions, a skewering of pretentious Hollywood cinematic devices or something else all together? 

Cast wise I felt Eva Mendes played an exceptional if perhaps a way too gorgeous looking coke whore. Val Kilmer and surprisingly to me anyway Xzibit both turn in fine performances with their limited screen time. That being said everyone takes a back seat to Cage's stunning performance. In a way it made me mad that he won't be more selective and instead turns it on for every 10th picture he is in. 

In summation this is a finely acted film that throws Hollywood conventions on its head. Some viewers are going to hate this film and hunky-dory with me. That's partly the fault of the title and the suits from marketing and partly the fault of the viewers having their own preconceived notions about what a movie should be. One thing this movie is not is a typical mainstream remake and for that I believe we can all be thankful.

Being a resident of New Orleans I anticipated this movie for months. I was kind of disappointed on my first viewing but when I saw it again on TV, I realized what a wonderful role Nicholas Cage did. It is a superb noir that combines the anti hero aspect played against the run down neighborhoods of New Orleans. I will watch this one again and I don't think it will reach its true value for a while.

The photography is outstanding and the soundtrack is appropriately added with some regional recordings that I noticed are not credited in the ending titles (even though the Star Spangled Banner credit is prominent). Kudos to Werner Herzog for this one!

"It is the essential I am looking for. What is the deepest essential that defines us as human beings?" - Werner Herzog

The original "Bad Lieutenant", directed by Abel Ferrara, powerfully acted by Harvey Keitel and featuring a sublime scene in which Keitel crumbles before Christ, was a load of hot air. With its tale of a thoroughly vile cop who lives in a moral cesspit but achieves deliverance through helping some nuns, Ferrara's themes of Catholic redemption were pulled straight out of the Martin Scorsese textbook, with a little Mel Gibson styled self-flagellation thrown in for good measure.

Those with no use for Catholic angst and pious punching bags should find director Werner Herzog's take on the "Bad Lieutenant" story refreshing. Packed with ridiculous shots of lizards, dancing spirits, goofy gangsters, poetic fish and walking midgets, Herzog has caught those expecting a standard genre flick off guard. But those familiar with Herzog's universe won't be surprised. Herzog's films have always rejected humanocentrism in favour for an absurd, and by extension darkly comic, universe. And so revoking the misdirected energy ("Why aren't you listening, God!?") and exaggerated histrionics of cinema's Gibsons, Ferraras and Scorseses, Herzog instead inserts a landscape of moral and universal chaos. There is no divinity to be addressed, no God to guide Herzog's characters, only malevolence, man one step away from total turmoil.

And so it's no surprise that Herzog's film is set in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Herzog's films often deal with two things: men journeying into and confronting a horrific Nature, and men going crazy with the collapse of their support structures and personal Master Signifiers (God, politics, money, private beliefs, family etc). Here, though, we see the aftermath of these movements. Man has already collided with a kind of cosmic mobocracy and is now pulling himself out of the wreckage. Nature has struck, civilisation has crumbled and so we watch as man begins his slow climb out of the debris, like a lizard clambering its way out of the primordial soup. 

But though Herzog always rejects humanocentrism, we can call him a humanist in the sense that his films often deal with questions of ethics. The end result is, like "Stroszek", not just another flick about a man and a hooker trying to do what's right, but mankind wrestling with questions of autonomy: how to be an autonomous subject in a world that limits self determination? How to hold fast to personal laws and disciplines in a world which is lawless, amoral and irrational? How to serve others when addiction, self-preservation and self-interests are seemingly hardwired into our bones?

Nicholas Cage, who plays the "Bad Lieutenant" character in Herzog's film, is frequently linked to Christ (standing next to Christ paintings etc), but like most men is both a saviour and a man who needs to be saved. The film opens with Cage diving into water to rescue a man (he will henceforth be linked to fish), an act of altruism which results in him permanently damaging his spine. To combat spinal pains, Cage turns to drugs, but soon develops an addiction. The rest of the film will be populated by characters caught in a strange web of moral chaos. Alcoholics will turn sober, feuding women will become friends, prostitutes will kindly take care of dogs, drug addictions will stem from acts of kindness, traffic cops will help despite getting nothing in return, junkies will turn into saviours etc etc. There are no clear-cut distinctions here, only people caught between a desire to serve themselves and to serve others and people desiring to help others but unable to help themselves.

The film ends with a moment of spirituality typical of Herzog. "Do you dream of fish?" a burnt-out Cage asks, his line recalling the words of a now dead child whose murderer, the appropriately named Big Fate, Cage obsessively tracks down. "My friend is a fish," the child said, "he live in my room. His fin is a cloud. He see me when I sleep." 

But what Herzog's climax alludes to is the big fish in the cloud, the benevolent God who watches us while we sleep, revealed to be all around us, in the helping hands of the denizens of Louisiana's flooded streets (in early Christianity, the fish symbol is based on the Greek word ichthus, which became a Grecian acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour"). Despite its irreverence and vulgarity this is thus a very warm film, Herzog's spirit best epitomised by a female traffic cop who helps our hero despite his refusal to give her some hot, drug fuelled sex. You don't scratch my back, but I'll scratch yours anyway. Keitel's Christ would be proud.

Incidentally, many have stated that Cage's performance compares unfavourably with Keitel's. What Cage's performance does, though, is reveal how silly Ferrara's overly earnest film always was. Cage, in contrast, with his Frankenstein shoulders, hunchback, hilariously large gun and Klaus Kinski haircut, is not only a demented villain right out of a German Expressionist horror film ("The Man Who Laughs"), but offers Cage another chance to indulge in the kind of zany scenery-chewing he adores. Cage's character is always acting, pretending or lying. He acts the part of a cop whilst being a crook, a crook whilst being a cop, straight when high, dedicated when desperate, confident when lost and approaches everyone he encounters with a new face, even fooling we the audience, as we're never quite sure exactly where his loyalties lie. Is he undercover or under-undercover? Is he saved or still stoned?

Of course it doesn't matter, as Herzog anticipates the continual collapse and rebuilding of his characters, like New Orleans' decimation and subsequent reconstruction. No good deed goes unpunished, Herzog says, but do it anyway.

8/10  Worth two viewings.

Werner Herzog's "Bad Lieutenant" is a pretty big bore. (spoiler) It runs at snail-pace with alotta dead-ends and loose-ends throwing in a few goofy hallucinations to boot. Nicholas Cage badly plays a drug-addict cop who at times changes his accent and patterns of speech for no apparent reason. Eva Mendez is first-billed but has a 3rd string role as a prostitute - her lines are subject to constant "give me drugs" and then all of the sudden repentant. The fact that Cage's character got away with so much was ridiculously unbelievable. His relationships with most of the people around him are appalling. I wasn't sure in some scenes whether it was supposed to be humorous or just tasteless. The movie is a pretty big mess meandering in and out of no-less than 4 side stories. Not sure what Herzog was trying to achieve, but it didn't turn out well at all. Not recommended, and will leave you scratching your head. Note - Val Kilmer steps in for a quick paycheck.

Repeated "shocking" scenes of Bad LT. shaking down criminals to steal/use their drugs? CHECK.

Bad LT. making bad bets and losing lots of money. Overreaction ensues? CHECK.

Nice, gritty cinematography and soundtrack? NOPE. (Appears to be a direct-to-DVD production, shot on video.) Any sort of plot worth following? NOT REALLY.

Nothing else really worth mentioning. If you like over-the-top Nick Cage this may keep your attention. I LOVE Herzog, this work is far bellow what he is capable of.

This is one heck of a sleazy time. If you like slumming, want to be blasted by a steam cleaner cuz you feel so dirty, like to wallow in slop, enjoy slimy scum bags, can't live without paranoid fantasies, then this is your two hours of mayhem and muck. Let's hope you never see Nic Cage look this creepy again - like someone attached it to the wrong end of a shop vac that sucked out a honey bucket. Cage is either very ill or an ex-actor inexplicably still acting.

You will enjoy the film if you're a BIG fan of Cage's, Herzog's, or if your expectations for B movies are D or less. The mistake Herzog made is that we don't care enough one way or the other about any of the main characters, plus he rode on the Abel's coattails. Years after seeing Harvey do BL I remember EVERYTHING about that guy, and how wonderfully loathsome he was. Cage's BL? - gone already.
