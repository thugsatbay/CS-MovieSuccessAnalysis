### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for "colored" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, "Hidden Figures," brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.

The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human "computers" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As "colored" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.

At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.

There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.

In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.

The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films that Hollywood likes to serve up.

However, to take that story and bump it up to a major "feel-good film" that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates this project to greatness.

I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that, you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the producers wanted. And it works.

The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.

Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad early.

And every good film or TV series needs a character who is "the glue" or a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the performance of her life as that "glue" and helps the director to pace the film.

Highly recommended.

Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama "Hidden Figures" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority  and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home)  in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie  and might be too much for many  but "Hidden Figures" is up to the challenge.

The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers  THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room  and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA  talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.

Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture  and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.

All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay  and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.

But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled "Colored" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers  and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart  and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.

"Hidden Figures" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women  until now. Don't let "Hidden Figures" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world. "A+"

This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.

You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.

The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.

Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone light up the whole time - truly a miracle.

Easy on the eye but not worthy of the hype and the Oscar nomination. An interesting story has been directed in a very heavy handed way, which to me was constantly irritating. Almost every scene is overstated to the point that, as others have said, there is a propaganda feel to the film. Did the director really need to portray every white person, bar two, as vigorously racist or anti-women, even though virtually all the characters are clearly intelligent and from well educated backgrounds? This is a film where the message would have been stronger and more credible if a degree of balance and subtlety had been added to the mix. The things I enjoyed: some strong performances by a very capable cast, a very authentic period setting, a story which is totally engaging. The thing which turned me off: the exaggeration.

This is one of those "based on true events" films that the moment you return from the theater you're going to hop on the internet and explore the story. That's a good sigh. Unfortunately, here the need to do some fact checking might not stem from all the right reasons.

Hidden Figures is an upbeat, inspiring tale about the role three African-American women played in the NASA program during the early 60's. First Katherine Johnson (Henson), our lead, a gifted mathematician and human computer trying to carve out a roll in the Space Test Group. Second, Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), leader of the "colored computers." She wants both the supervisor title she deserves and to survive the transition to IBM's mechanical computers. Finally Mary Jackson (Monae), who is trying to overcome discriminatory policies to become NASA's first female engineer. These women must meet challenges in the workplace then return home to more struggles African-Americans were fighting nationwide. 

Having the performances to anchor your character drama goes along way. Henson is solid, but Spencer is Oscar worthy and Monae's performance is part of a spectacular 2016. I will be on the lookout for more from this talent. Kudos to the supporting roles played by Ali and Costner. Beyond the highlight performances, the scenario is well worth a shot. We have seen heroes fighting against segregation. We have seen space race movies. The mix presents America at its finest and most appalling. A cute combo. The woman at the core are also very deserving of a chance in the sun. The problems creep in with presentation. The director/writer Melfi and co-writer Schroeder were clearly unsatisfied with the quiet, real nobility with which these woman conducted themselves. I cannot say if what the creators did is ethical, but the addition of obviously manufactured drama was a damning decision. This leads to some awkward trust issues. After watching some Hollywood like Johnson erupting at her boss's boss, it becomes more difficult to believe in the little things. Did Johnson really need to run a half a mile just to use the restroom? Or even the climax. On the day of the launch, did John Glenn trust Johnson's calculations over the IBM? It turns out only one of these inclusions are factual. Not the one you think, and perhaps the true story demonstrates more bravery. 

I'm not going to share any more of my digging here. Others asked the same questions and the answers are readily available. The point is after I watched Hidden Figures I wanted to learn if I had been lied too. Sad, because doubts are not what stories this wonderful deserve. Beyond this major stumble, Hidden Figures is well worth anyone's time. Educational, but entertaining. Positive without preachy. Family friendly in a genuine way. At the theater, I sat next to a nineish year old who kept asking her mother questions. The daughter was interested and wanted to follow every detail. The mother gave brisk answers not wanting to miss a moment. That's a true event, I swear, and the best praise for Hidden Figures I can muster.

I really enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. The story was compelling and laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented "in spite" of being black or "in spite" of being women, they were just amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.

Much of the atmosphere of racism in the movie did not ring true for me. In many cases it didn't even make sense, so I looked into it. The first question I had for the internet was "Did Katherine Goble have to run half a mile to use a bathroom on the NASA complex?" The answer is no. For more info on the conditions and life of Katherine Johnson check out the interview with her here: https://youtu.be/r8gJqKyIGhE. In particular check out 11:49 where she says she "didn't feel segregation". Everyone was working. The job was important and they weren't going to jeopardize the mission with foolish racist antics. She was part of a team. I would've liked to have heard so much more about Katherine and her mind and work, less about the social issues of the 1960s! 

I understand screenwriters have to condense a large amount of information into a couple of hours but the ham-handed and, let's be honest, false representation of racism at NASA and the treatment of these women was a repeated and unwelcome intrusion into what should have been a very interesting and educational movie about these remarkable women. For example: I strongly suspect Katherine Goble never, ever would have been so unprofessional as to scream at her boss and co-workers like she does in what Hollywood probably sees as a "cathartic" scene. It was completely out of character and a distraction from what should have been the real story, that of Katherine's accomplishments. Goble was a professional and intelligent woman who would've never done such a thing which, to my way of thinking, says a lot more about her than such a silly, manufactured scene. 

But I don't want to run the risk of being just as ham-handed in my review and I'll leave my criticism at that. I'll only add, don't let the prospect of being bludgeoned by an anti-racism message keep you from going to see Hidden Figures.

Hidden Figures tells the story of three African American women in the late sixties as they become instrumental to NASA in putting John Glen on the moon. Directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner and Kirstin Dunst, Hidden Figures would be a good film had it not been so concerned with the idea of the empowerment of women that it forgot to be a good, engaging film. It has the proper ingredients to become a heavy hitter but trades it in using its excellent cast as more of a political statement than anything else.

The film starts off by introducing us to Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson (Henson, Spencer and Janelle Moàne) in almost the exact same ways. We see that Katherine is a number cruncher and a brilliant woman all around...then the exact same character traits are rehashed for Spencer and Moàne's characters. There is nothing different between the women, there are 3 of the same character in one film. The only difference between the three is Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance that makes her thoroughly enjoyable throughout a film that would have been a direct-to-digital film otherwise. The film does very little to give any development to these women and keeps drowning us in the notion that "this is girl power." It became extremely redundant after awhile and left me waiting for the film to get serious but it never did. This is a film that is more about what the characters did rather than how and why they did it.

Overall, Hidden Figures is a bland film with paper thin characters that tries to make more of a political statement rather than make a good film. This is a perfect example of political climate affecting creative endeavors. If there were anything I could say it is: if you're going to see the film, see it for no other reason than Taraji P. Henson's excellent performance. Taking her out of this film in any way, shape or form would have probably stopped this film in the development process but then again, maybe that is where this should have stayed.

A well told story of the 60's - fashion, seriousness of the space competition, but more importantly the contributions of 3 women in a time where they were not even given the credit of having a brain. Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.

Engineers and adding-machine operators (called "computers") working at NASA in the early 1960's included a few black women. Since the Civil Rights movement was only beginning, and NASA was located in southern regions of the US, these women were subject to legal discrimination. "Hidden Figures" follows the careers of some of these women. But it does this in a heavy-handed, formulaic way.

Ever since "The Ugly Duckling" of Hans Christian Anderson, the formula has been predictable: a member of a despised minority is grudgingly admitted into a previously exclusive activity. Will the minority figure excel in the new position, or will he/she fail miserably, justifying the prejudices of the ruling class? Telling you the answer would be a spoiler, so you'll have to guess it for yourselves, but it's not too difficult.

In "Hidden Figures", all the whites are bigots (except for John Glenn and one department head), and all the blacks are hard-working, clean, patriotic moral wonders. This is history dumbed down to junior high-school level. The heroine, a mathematically gifted black widow has managed to stay chaste and raise three perfect children while handling a difficult job under trying conditions. The other characters are no more believable.

The period detail is mostly well done, with electric typewriters and glass-knobbed coffee percolators. But in the early '60s, all engineers would have carried slide rules, the way doctors wear stethoscopes. There are none to be seen here. Also, any time the heroine wants to work out a mathematical problem, she has to climb a ladder and write it out on a large blackboard. Scrap paper existed in the '60s.

If you want to watch a simple-minded morality play rather than a movie, history reduced to the level of "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer", then "Hidden Figures" is for you.

Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).

The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.

With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama "Selma" since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.

Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present. It's sure to go far with various accolades.

The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no matter how many would say otherwise.

Everything from the very beginning of this movie is Disney perfect. These poorly payed, deprived black women live in perfectly decorated houses, drive relatively late model vehicles, raise children, all the while being treated as second class citizens. The sad reality is that while the film admits to the racist abuse that white America inflicted upon blacks, by uplifting their perceived image it demeans the reality and gives Americans the idea that the systematic racism was really not that bad. Typically for most American movies it is trying to rewrite history in a vain attempt make America great again.

Let's be frank here. They could have made the three black, female leads read out the telephone listings for two hours and this hokum would have been nominated for an Oscar. It is extremely clichéd, agenda-driven, pedestrian twoddle. The movie's devoid of any feeling with its filmsy, cookie-cutter characters and hackneyed, tedious plot. It's just a typical throwaway blockbuster splurged out by Hollywood without any creative thought applied. There's no humour, excitement, originality, nothing, nada. It reminded me of last year's similarly banal Oscar nomination Bridge of Spies, in that it should be nowhere near any awards, but it is far worse. 

It took me countless hours and about 8 attempts to persevere through it. I'm not quite sure what the mental capability is of the intended audience, but it would take something at the larva stage of metamorphosis to find this in any way engaging. Everything about this is forced, with the music trying to squeeze emotion out of the audience, but failing miserably. It also rams down the audience's throat the interesting revelation that everyone at NASA (i.e. all the white people), aside from these three women, were incontinent ignoramuses. After watching the magnificent Lion, which has real feeling permeating through every scene, this was just a complete disaster.

The acting was great and overall the movie was entertaining but the story is nonsense. When is Hollywood going to make movies that include everyone in this society without 'discrimination' being the focal point? When will they make movies without singling out white people as racists? There's nothing groundbreaking here. It's the typical story of white people oppressing blacks and how the characters rise above it all; another cliché and stereotype perpetuated year after year after year. Now they're portraying nasa as a racist organization. I didn't work at langley or live in virginia at that time but I seriously doubt much of the story is accurate. My first job out of college was working for the fed in the late 70s and there was no such nonsense. I met a lot of knuckleheads when I did a stint at an aerospace company but during the rest of my career in IT there was never any discrimination against women or minorities. It's not that I didn't see it; it didn't exist. I find it hard to believe that engineers, mathematicians and scientists at nasa would behave that way. My first job with the fed, I was introduced to two computer programmers (one black, one white) that worked on Univac I which was the first commercial computer. I was at the beginning of my career and they were at the end so I looked at them as dinosaurs and obsolete. Later I began to appreciate their careers. When they started back in the 50s, there were probably less than 1000 computer programmers in the whole world and now there are millions and I'm only counting the hard coders, not script kiddies or web coders. But, you couldn't make a movie about either one because frankly their working lives were boring. Nope, no drama in the workplace. And anyway, in IT and technology in general, no one usually cares about who's first or what happened, just what happens next. But 'colored' coffee pots is just made up Hollywood nonsense and perpetuates the stereotypes and divisions in the US. The movie is not a documentary but it's not about nasa either. It's just a story about racial prejudice and overcoming discrimination. However, I can't get over all the technical errors and mumbo jumbo the writers came up with. Usually producers hire technical consultants but in more recent years it seems Hollywood doesn't care what people might take away from a movie. They don't care if actors are saying dumb lines because they figure the audience is too stupid to notice. I find it insulting to pay $12 for a movie and then have to sit thru gibberish. Plus the story was written for five year olds. I'll bet my life savings that nasa didn't hold up the launch so they could check calculations. That's just silly. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who believe what they see in the movies so I have to mention two things. 1) you can't bypass a starter motor and never, never try to start a car the way it was shown in the movie. It's very dangerous. 2) computers in that day did not solve math equations or derive new math. They just did your basic arithmetic. The work the character was doing in the movie could never be replaced by a computer of that day. Computers today, I'm not sure.

I understand that this was to be a hero piece. I understand that the main characters had to be better than everybody else. But what started to grate, and then to annoy, was the fact that not a single other character contributed a single thing. Although it was sometimes talked about, no character apart from the main two actually do any math, or any programming. The 'Big Bag Theory' guy complained some. I think Kevin Costner held a piece of chalk a couple of times, but he spent most of the time telling us how awesome the main character was. Whilst the height of realism is not required, the hard focus on the main character suggested almost that she was doing ALL the work herself, which made the whole thing look weak and unconvincing.

(Mini-spoiler: what DID give her the right to insist on attending a classified briefing? Theoretically, other people would have to know data too, but, of course, no one else does anything at all, so her case is different. Seemed like a pretty cushy job to work in that office.) Some other things happened in this movie. They weren't as important as the main characters. (The really motivated and snappy character got left behind about half way through. She had to go to school, so she didn't get to save everybody or whatever single-handedly, like the others.)

First off, my aunt worked at 'The Cape' during this time and never heard of this. She was working in the same section as these ladies supposedly were working. Now, lots of personnel were in flux during this time and she may have missed them, but people talk and no one ever talked to her about an entire group of black ladies calculating launch/orbital dynamics. In the south, this would have been a major story even in the sixties. This is a great movie as movies go, but it was hard for me to enjoy it while sifting through all the overt political statements. I saw where the movie only made around half a million dollars on opening weekend. Also, I read reports of actresses buying out an entire theater's showing of this movie. So, that explains the obscene total gross of the movie. I'm sure special interest groups bought out theaters to pad the numbers as well. The idea that our brave astronauts were nothing more than space monkeys taking a ride on the backs of black, female mathematicians is insulting to both parties. They had scratch paper and slide rules in the 60's and every engineer had them. Showing someone climb a ladder to calculate trajectories on a blackboard is theatrical, but adds questions to the credibility of this story. Henderson's performance IS Oscar worthy--and I love Olivia Spencer. I am just worried that more and more of our nation's history will be revised to give MORE credit than where credit was actually due. One thing that truly bothers me: this movie was released AFTER most of the people involved with this stage of the space program were deceased. So, there is no way to ASK anyone if this is factually correct. Also, I'm sure this will be required viewing at schools during black history month.

For his second feature film, Theodore Melfi tries this time to deal with a more serious topic: the role of black women in the American society in early 60's. This is how we meet Katherine Goble, a gifted woman, working as a "computer" in the Langley Research Center and two of her colleagues and friends Mary Jackson, yearning for a engineer position and Dorothy Vaughan an unofficial supervisor. All along the movie, we will see how women had to work hard to establish theirselves and gain recognition in the male-dominated engineering world.

This is for the plot, now let's go deeper into this movie. Actually, there is nothing fundamentally wrong in this movie, everything is just OK. But making a film about segregation and misogyny does not make necessarily a good movie. And here is the evidence. During the two hours of this movie we will witness all forms of discrimination but nothing more that we've seen dozens of times. Unlike some other movies, such as Fences for example, where these sensitive topics were dealt with subtlety we are here just talking about discrimination to give substance to the movie.

That aside, the story behind the movie aims to show the work of NASA engineers and computers during the 60's star wars between Americans and Russians. Once again, in order to wow the spectators, characters just throw us mathematical formulas and spatial jargon all along the movie. But when you have a better look on it you can just see trivia or nonsense formulas. It is a common way in movies to try to impress spectators with non sense jargon, and this movie is not an exception.

Eventually, there are all the same some good things with this movie. It allows us to have a better understanding about these hidden figures who were at the root of American space conquest and it is also a way to acknowledge the value of their work. Besides the acting and the filmmaking are good enough.

To conclude, even though the screen writing remains interesting I think that this story would have been a better documentary than a movie.

I had looked forward to this movie ever since hearing about it. I am a big space program buff, and delight in little-known stories being told.

There may be some spoilers in what I write below, so proceed with caution!

I did enjoy the movie while watching it, but was constantly taken out of the moment by the never ending stream of silly, sloppy mistakes. I have no problem with creative license and dramatizing stories for better results. But there were a LOT of real honkers throughout. I got the impression the everyone was so focused on the story that all the details went by without review or supervision.

I don't plan to write a comprehensive list of all that was wrong. But I will illustrate just a few things:

- The inside of a Mercury capsule was barely larger than the astronaut. Yet the scenes inside the capsule looked like something on the accuracy level of "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Just throw a knob and a duct on a piece of gray plywood behind the astronaut and call it a day. And when entering the Mercury capsule, the threshold looks for all the world like it is made from a white painted window frame bought at Home Depot.

- From day to day in the NASA parking lot, it looks like nothing changes...maybe all those engineers never moved their cars.

- Sound effects and foley sounds throughout are often inappropriate or inaccurate, and for no good reason. I just don't think the film makers were trying in this regard. One example, the IBM computer room printer sounds like a completely different kind of printer...this is as jarring as seeing the jet in "Airplane" with the sound of a propeller plane in the soundtrack, but unlike that movie it is not funny.

- When John Glenn's capsule is discovered to have possible heat shield issues, that concern (which did not last long) has time to be carried to the press,distributed to the public, and there is time for all of them to get all worked up over it and fret in front of TV sets. And when the engineers are fretting over the possibly loose heat shield, the female 'computer' (the focus of the story) chimes in authoritatively with some wisdom that she almost certainly could not have known....yes she was a brilliant mathematician and knew lots of things, but was she also suddenly a materials scientist, a spacecraft engineer with expertise in heat shields and re-entry physics, who would be the only one in the room full of experts who seemed to know anything about the matter at hand?

- Apparently nobody on the film crew knows that the heat shield is on the bottom of the capsule, not the side.

Does this kind of thing ruin the movie? No, it does not. But if more attention had been paid these details this would have been a greater movie and not just a decent, feel-good, 'made for TV style' movie.

There's a scene in Hidden Figures in which Al Harrison, the harried NASA administrator tasked during the early 1960s with getting an American into spacequicktells his staff of scientists, mathematicians, theorists, and engineers, "We all get there together or we don't get there at all." He's speaking not about ego or seniority or degrees of education, but about the integration of an enormously-gifted African-American woman into their ranks. 

Although that line of dialogue, as spoken by actor Kevin Costner as Harrison, is inspiring enough to have been prominently featured in the television, radio, and computer advertising for the picture, there's really nothing particularly special about Costner's delivery of the line in the moviethe words are spoken with some authority, but also fairly quietly, almost conversationally, without any emphasis.

And that's one of the most likable aspects of Hidden Figures, the new 20th Century-Fox/Fox 2000 motion picture about the early days of the US space program and the importance of three very special people to the project's eventual success in landing a man on the moon. NASA was during that time very much a man's domain. The story of a handful of uniquely-gifted women who were able to gain entry to that exclusive territory is inspiring enough. That some of these women were African-American during a time of segregation and oppression makes a great story even better.

With the possible exception of the three women whose story it depicts, Hidden Figures is populated by characters who are sometimes flawed and eccentric or motivated by their own narrow personal agendas, but united in a mission to navigate the impossible, and in the process invent an entirely new branch of science.

In this way, Hidden Figures is refreshingly a movie about integration and civil rights in which integration and civil rights are almostbut not quitesecondary to a crackerjack story about exceptional people during exceptional times.

Katherine Goble, played by Taraji P. Henson, is an intellectual prodigy whom since childhood has grasped advanced theoretical mathematical concepts as if God Himself were her tutor. A shy, reserved, and bespectacled widow and mother of three, Henson plays the role as if segregation is an unfortunate and irritating inconvenience which only serves to distract her from her primary scientific passion.

Mary Jackson, played by model and recording artist Janelle Monae, is a research mathematician and physical scientist who yearns for an education in engineering. The mother of two and married to a civil rights activist, Mary is more career-oriented, determined and irreverently outspoken than her friend Katherinethe word sassy springs to mind. Unable to pursue her educational degree in a state where scholastic segregation is still legal, Mary ultimately takes her ambitions into a courtroom and challenges the law.

Dorothy Vaughn, portrayed by the wonderful Octavia Spencer, is the most philosophically-canny of the three friends, seemingly willing to compromise with segregation for as long as it doesn't interrupt her plans or career path. A mathematician assigned because of her gender and race to a secretarial pool, Dorothy finally employs subterfuge, and even a humorous little piece of larceny, as a means of gaining the information she needs to operate the new room-sized IBM computer NASA's experts don't even know how to turn on.

Registering the most impact among the supporting characters is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison. As played by Costner, Harrison is so consumed and obsessed with his mission of placing an American into space that he's virtually oblivious to the world and society which surrounds him. A consummate professional, the gruff, humorless Harrison needs the best scientists in the country to help him invent the new science required of his missionno matter their color. Harrison is a fictional character, an amalgamation of several different NASA administrators, and Costner plays him perfectly.

Also notable is actor Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. Although he does not bear even the slightest resemblance to the astronaut, Powell easily captures Glenn's million-megawatt charisma and charm. When the IBM computer's trajectory figures appear shaky, Glenn insists Goble personallyhe calls her "the smart girl," the cardinal plaudit in Glenn's vocabularycheck the numbers before he climbs onto the rocket for his launch into history. It's a charming, little-known detail to an American legend, and it's absolutely true.

Theodore Melfi guides Hidden Figures with a loose and relaxed hand, wisely allowing the story to unfold naturally, in its own time. He essentially lets the story to speak for itself. While the viewer never gets the sense that actual historical events are unfolding on screen, it's a consummately agreeable history lesson. is so fascinating to others.

Hidden Figures takes more than a few liberties with the facts, but the filmmakers will be quick to point out that the picture is not a documentarythe words projected on screen at the beginning of the movie read, "Based on a True Story." As Americans, we sometimes seem to hobble ourselves, and move forward only with great reluctance and deliberation. And even accounting for the progress we achieve, often after a period of enlightenment we take a step or two backward and build walls of mistrust instead of bridges of understanding.

While Hidden Figures is being described accurately as a "feel-good picture," at the time of the historic space mission of John Glenn which concludes the picture, the fire hoses and police attack dogs shamefully used during the historic civil rights demonstrations of Selma and Birmingham were still a year or so in the future.

So as we're patting ourselves on the back and congratulating ourselves on how far we've traveled since that time in the early 1960s when Kevin Costner's character in Hidden Figures tells his newly integrated staff "We get there together or we don't get there at all," we might also want to be mindful of how far we still need to go.

Now that is a movie that everyone needs to see. It relates the life of three women, but in their tracks the life of millions of blacks who have contributed to American culture and success.

The cast is outstanding, the music off the hook. The cinematography spotless. Dream-like. The right combination of colors and light. A beauty.

It also shows that intelligence connects beyond gender and race. I am referring to the roles - one/played by Costner and 2/ the part of Glenn Allen that show that true intelligence fosters tolerance, and it brings the human race forward.

The story is touching, and it might spark a love for mathematics in you--even if you come from anti-nerd matter!

No need to mention that the trinity Spencer, Monae, Hensen are as bright as the stars they are trying to reach in the movie. Costner true to himself is an incarnation of tolerance and genius as i remembered him in the Bodyguard. And the guy who plays Glenn Allen is candy for the eye: these two remind us that there are some nice folks out there--and that intelligence breaks all barriers. 

Truly stimulating for the mind--one of the best movie I have seen lately (after SPOTLIGHT, same level)

This movie deserves all possible awards;for it is just "avant-garde", in the style, the content, and the strength it oozes!

Came out the day of my birthday--Epiphany. That has to mean something! Support that gem of a movie!

In the 60's, the Afro-American mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) work in NASA performing important roles in the race of the United State against Russia to conquer the space. They face the segregation everywhere but their brilliance help the safe return of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) back to Earth among other achievements.

"Hidden Figures" tells the story of three Afro-American Genius in NASA in a shameful period of segregation. The film is warm-hearted and the cast has inspired performances. It is beautiful to see the recognition of the importance of these three women some fifty and something years later and tell the world. My vote is eight.

It was an enjoyable movie with lots of surprising facts I didn't know about. Definitely worth it, it was fun and enjoyable. But you can't talk about the space program without talking about Wernher Von Braun. You have to call it propaganda for not including the main engineer guy in the movie. Just look up the Saturn V rocket. Its the rocket that took us to the moon and it was created by two German American former nazi's. History is more important than propaganda. So now we know that German ex nazi's and black women helped put us into space. I think its good to know and I hate that they didn't include Werner Von Braun and Rudolph since they were basically the lead rocket designers for Nasa, and even helped create the first rockets ever before in Germany, the V-2 rocket. -3 points for not including them.

First I would like to say that I thought this was a tremendous movie. It is well written, acted, directed, and the story is amazingly compelling. Then I read a bit about the true story of these amazing women. There were such great liberties taken with their stories that I was a bit appalled. While it did a great job making us feel just how amazing these women were it failed to show the role NASA played correctly. I will simply paste the wiki of the reality of the mindset of NASA as well as the real story, in a super condensed way. Science is anti-stupidity and racism is stupid. I wish that NASA and science had been presented in a bit better light. Paste starts here:

The film, set at NASA in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, an all-black group of female mathematicians, who were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing in 1949, becoming the first black supervisor at the NACA and one of the few female supervisors. In 1958, when the NACA made the transition to NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.

Mary Jackson completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958, becoming NASA's first black female engineer. Katherine Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was formed in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the Group and Katherine moved along with them. She coauthored a research report in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report. 

The Space Task Group was led by Robert Gilruth, not Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure. Vivian Mitchell and Paul Stafford are composites of several team members reflecting common social views and attitudes of the time. Karl Zielinski is based on Mary Jackson's mentor Kazimierz "Kaz" Czarnecki. John Glenn, who was much older than depicted at the time of launch, did ask specifically for Johnson to verify the IBM calculations, although she had several days before the launch date to complete the process.

Hidden Figures is average. Everything about it is average. While its message is pure, the sheer schmaltz that drips off the screen condemns it to obscurity seconds after you leave the theatre; the entire production feeling forced and manufactured in an Oscar bait factory.

Following the lives of three African-American women working for NASA, Hidden Figures chronicles their rise against prejudice and essential role in putting man in space. As a true story, there is the potential for a fascinating biopic into the lives of these women but unfortunately director Theodore Melfi chose to dress up the story with an American idealism that doesn't serve the real horrors for people of colour in the 50s and 60s. Everything drips with a coat of audience friendly paint, striving to please the audiences with sass and emotional manipulation rather than a true human story. This isn't helped by a weak and bland aesthetic that looks more Disney channel than Oscar winner; dated effects and an unadventurous camera drain the film of having at least a visual appeal. It isn't offensively bad, just forgettable: Like most of the film. Don't get me wrong, I fully believe that stories like this have to be told but when everything is this forced, this false; it just isn't worthy of delivering a message of equality to the world. Compare it to someone like Spike Lee who uses the medium of film to its full potential regarding themes of race.

Despite all this, Hidden Figures still gives its all to this falseness. The film will give the audience the highs and lows they expect; it just won't leave a lasting impact as it fails to take any risks. It is obvious that everyone in the star studded cast is giving their all, especially Taraji P. Henson in the lead role of Katherine Johnson and Kevin Costner as her strained boss Al Harrison, but most of the cast just aren't given the screen time to establish a proper connection with the audience, mainly the extremely talented Mahershala Ali in a wasted role as Johnsons love interest.

With all of its good intentions, Hidden Figures just doesn't do justice to this inspirational story. Dragged down by the need to please a wide audience and the awards panels, it fails at its most basic mission of leaving any lasting effect on the viewer and will undoubtedly fade into obscurity.

A well-meaning crowd-pleaser, with nice performances and a truly exceptional true story running things, that never chooses to rise above its safely formulaic Hollywood trappings.

I found this movie's depictions of such clearly bigoted white people and their Civil Rights era forms of racism (colored bathrooms and coffee pots) that never really digs into the more insidious nature of institutional racism, to be problematic. This overtly racist world feels so far removed that it almost makes it seem like racism has been solved, that it's no longer an issue.

All you have to do is be exceptional, a once in a lifetime genius, and racism won't be able to stand in your way. It suggests that black people do have to work harder and be superior in an obvious way in order to overcome, and this is never addressed in the movie. Don't be common, no one can help you then.
