### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film "Six Shooter" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.

There aren't too many non-Belgian films set in Belgium, and Bruges is a beautiful but odd place to set an entire movie. You'll probably learn more about the place than you ever need to know as Ken narrates their sightseeing excursions with a few factoids about the place. The entire first act is driven by the chemistry between Farrell and Gleason as they deliver rapid-fire patter that reminds one of McDonagh's background as a playwright, but it makes them as immediately endearing as Vincent and Jules in "Pulp Fiction," allowing for an even bigger impact as things happen to them. Our first encounter with the boys' boss Harry is an expletive filled telegraph and an equally amusing phone conversation with Ken, making it obvious that this is a mobster cut from the same cloth as Ben Kingsley's Don Logan. Those who don't recognize the voice will be thrilled when they learn who plays Harry, because it's a pleasant surprise.

This is easily Colin Farrell's best role and performance in a long time, one that allows him to show a lot of range, not just as the big-mouthed prat we assume Ray to be, but also as a thoughtful man distraught about what happened in London. Having seen the error of his ways, he feels the need to make right, even if he hides it with a lot of complaining and arguments, and that carries over to Gleason's Ken, continuing his great run with McDonagh.

McDonagh has created a clever script that interweaves its small cast of characters into an intricate crime caper that mixes humor, violence and true heartfelt human emotions into a brilliant debut feature. Just when you think you know where things are going, McDonagh throws a sharp curve ball at you and then another, and another, and pretty soon, what started as a two-handed talkie has turned into a hold-your-breath action flick, when Harry turns up in Bruges to rectify some business that Ken has botched. Even so, it never loses what made the first half so charming and entertaining, because McDonagh's impressive dialogue remains at the forefront for the extended confrontation between Ken and Harry. The ending might be somewhat grim for some tastes going by the lightness of what's gone before, but the way everything is tied together makes it all worth it.

Anyone worried that Tarantino and Ritchie's best work might be behind them, can revel in the promise of McDonagh's take on the crime-comedy genre, as this talented filmmaker shows that "Six Shooter" was no fluke and this movie begins what's likely to be a long and promising film career. On top of that, if "In Bruges" doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close

I've used IMDb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now. I had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in NYC last night to which Colin Farrell attended. I bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fiancé to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie. I figured it would be a "hard-to-understand" foreign, indie film whose humor would be lost on a "dumb American." However, the truth was absolutely the opposite. My hard-to-please fiancé agreed.

The movie is a bit slow for the first half but it's entirely necessary to set the mood and the contrast between that and the second half. That's all I'll say so as not to spoil anything. It is really a great movie. There's comedy, beautiful cinematography, and awesome action scenes, albeit scattered throughout and absent at times when the viewer may be growing weary. I'd highly recommend seeing this movie. It's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket while most of the crap out there these days isn't worth the cost of the paper they print the tickets on.

Let us all know what you think after you see it.

...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.

The dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's "You Kill Me" was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then "In Bruges" is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel ("Brighton Rock" specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.

McDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in "Schindler's List" and the recent "Harry Potter" films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.

Ultimately "In Bruges" meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. "In Bruges" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.

Going into this movie, I didn't have the highest expectations for it. However, I went to see it anyways, and let me just say that by the end credits I was completely shocked out how much I actually liked this movie. It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something "different", if you're sick of seeing the same "hollywood-esque" movies, then please give this movie a shot. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue.

A European film through and through, showing its deep theatrical roots, "In Bruges" works on may levels, and is a fine night at the cinema.

The film follows the denouement of a "job" gone bad for two Irish hit men, who are forced to hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and really can't stand the inactivity. The forced waiting, a symbolic purgatory in both assassins' struggle for absolution, gives Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell a chance to act through some marvelous comic dialogue.

The film itself looks like it was filmed in an area of the old city of Bruges that is no more than a 500 square metre radius. It doesn't matter, because the film is a character study more than anything, and like all good theatre, the character interplay allows the audience to forget the confined spaces.

Ralph Fiennes comes into the film late basically stealing Ben Kingsley's character from "Sexy Beast". This has to be an absolutely deliberate choice, so can't really be criticized. The writing is so good that Fiennes can have real fun with it. All the actors do, as a matter of fact.

I have been deeply suspicious of Colin Farrell's ability to read a script in the past. His choices of projects in the past has been spotty. Not this time: his acting ability is brought to the fore by director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh. Farrell gives a very strong performance as a morally challenged hit-man.

Brendan Gleeson has been around forever, and is a renowned character actor. You may remember him from "Braveheart" as Hamish Campbell, Mel Gibson's loyal adjutant. He is able to completely bury himself in this part. Colin Farrell has the capacity to reach these heights as well, and in fact, in this film, shows many of the mannerisms and intensity of Russell Crowe (whom I consider to be the best actor on the planet).

I appreciated the comedy and satire working hand in hand with the moral complexity of the characters' inner struggles. It makes for a very satisfying film, one that is much more than entertainment. When you consider what the budget was in comparison to many Hollywood films, "In Bruges" serves as a reminder that it is the script and the quality of the direction that makes a film. Why Hollywood thinks they can just throw money into a project and expect people to come to the cinema is beyond me.

One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.

After seeing the trailer, In Bruges looked like a plodding British comedy with little originality and repetitious humor, hence the low expectations. Yet, In Bruges exceeded my minimal expectations, and, unlike my impression from the trailer, was an original drama with good acting and a nice blend of comedy mixed in. It was funny in the right places and appropriately dramatic when the story shifted into high gear towards the end.

Set in, no surprise here, Bruges, Belgium, the plot focuses on two London hit men, Ray played by Colin Farrell, and Ken, played by Brendan Gleeson. The pair is sent to Belgium after Ray botches his first hi. And therein lies the humor, Ray has no interest in being in the medieval city, and Ken wants to sight see.

I've never really liked Colin Farrell but who knew he had such a good sense of comedic timing? There is a running gag involving fighting with a bottle, and karate, that he manages to keep fresh as it pops up throughout the film. Brendan Gleeson's character provides the moral center and plays the straight man to Farrell's Ray. This works well as the movie turns more serious towards the end. However, for my money, the best performance is delivered by Ralph Fiennes who plays Harry the pair's criminal overlord back in London. Whereas Gleeson character embodies the moral center, Fiennes's Harry fills the role of principled immorality, if there is such a thing. Fiennes creates a character with a dubious moral center and is a quite believable figure of menace when he travels to Bruges to square off with Ken. Also, of note, is Jordan Prentice, an irritable dwarf who's in town to act in a movie filming there. His ramblings in one scene, about a coming race war, is worth the price of admission right there.

The only aspect of the film that didn't work for me was Ray's love interest. Early in the film he manages to woo Chloe, a drug dealer with, drum roll please, a heart of gold. For my tastes, the budding romance seems a little forced and comes across more as a vehicle for jokes and drama. But it's a small thing and I doubt anyone but me would notice.

I intentionally left a lot of plot points out, because, as I've mentioned, this film surprised me in a good way and I don't won't to ruin it for anyone else.

In Bruges is a good film. Go see it.

At the very least, it'll make you want to visit Bruges.

Well, to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, nor am I fan of Colin Farrell, in fact I really didn't like him at all previously....but now I have a new found respect for him and with Gleason and Fienes both in excellent form coupled with a very quick and witty script and some surprisingly violent scenes, this film really has something for everyone (except the young kids).

I go to see 2 or 3 movies every week and this is just about the best one I've seen since Last King of Scotland and The Departed came out a couple of years back.

I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.

If I am to gripe about anything, it will be the ending. Not the very end, however, as that is absolutely perfect. The camera-work, voice-over, and final shot cannot be argued, it is the climax that happens just before that rings false. It is the only moment like that, though, so I don't hold it against the film. McDonagh needed a way to get his characters to their arc's conclusions and if that means turning one of the roles, at first seeming to be there for jokes, into a pawn for a symmetrical kind of convenience, I'll give him that reprieve. As far as fitting with the story, yeah it works; it has to because the incident is alluded to unknowingly at many times during the course of the sightseeing romp. I guess I think it fits too well and wish McDonagh could have come up with another way to do it.

Besides that, though, In Bruges is a great time at the theatre. Colin Farrell is steadily becoming a favorite of mine with his precise comic timing and broad facial expressions. I may be one of the few people on earth that loved his comedic turn in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, (yes I truly believe the comedy was intentional), and here he shows it was not a fluke. Kind of similar to his scene-stealing role in Intermission, he is a punk with a lousy disposition and disregard for tact. Here, however, he also has a conscience. This tug-of-war is ripe for laughs as he is a sweet guy, he just doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut. One-liners are in abundance and you will be laughing continuously. Brendan Gleeson helps this fact by being an effective straightman to play off of. He knows the score and tries to enjoy the "fairytale" city while his cohort sulks and puts on "moods like a five year old" because, honestly, unless you grew up on a farm and were slightly retarded, Bruges is really just hell on earth. (Actually, the city looks pretty great and I wouldn't mind checking it out once in my lifetime.) The periphery roles, and there are many, also add depth and interest to the film. Small characters like Eric Godon's alcove loving gun dealer, Jordan Prentice as a horse-tranquilizer taking midget actor (he played Howard the Duck, that is awesome), and Clémence Poésy as the love interest and enigma Cholë all are fun and never quite feel just thrown in as jokes, but instead integral parts to the story. Of course, the great Ralph Fiennes is involved too. His accent and vocabulary rivals Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast and unfortunately is a much smaller part than anticipated from the trailer. Well maybe not unfortunately, because if he was in more it might have become a gimmick. I also couldn't help stop thinking of Harry Potter with Mad-Eye Moody, Lord Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all involved.

I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a good drama with comic overtones. Don't go in thinking this is to be a total good time, with laughs a minute, there is so much more to the tale that you may not expect or necessarily be hoping for. At times it is very dark and drains every molecule of happiness out of your heads, but thankfully a good joke or line will be coming shortly to alleviate the depression.

Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.

Colin Farrell delivers by far his best performance to date. He is funny, dangerous, sexy and emotional throughout. This is exceptional acting from a guy who tends to disappoint. Of course, it helps to have magnificent writing and this one most certainly delivers on that front. The dialogue is quirky and quick ... so tune in early.

Strong work also from Brendon Gleeson, who all will recognize from "Gangs of New York" and the Harry Potter series. He is a tough guy with a streak of humanity. The third piece of the puzzle is Ralph Fiennes as the mastermind bad guy. The supporting work is fine from Jordan Prentice as the dwarf actor (sadly Mr. Prentice is most famous for playing Howard the Duck) and a very cute Clemence Poesy as Farrell's odd love interest.

Very few writers can write dialogue like this and even fewer can juggle as many layers without making a film seem busy, crowded or forced. Hopefully Mr. McDonagh will bring more of his work to the big screen ... he certainly adds a touch of class!

A lot of reviews see fit to give a thorough plot summary, so I'll just talk b*llocks instead.

In Bruges is a grown up gangster film not because it uses the word f*ck very often, though it does, because even a child can type 'f*ck' repetitively into a screen play and judging by most recent gangster films, with a few notable exceptions, that wouldn't be too far from the truth.

In Bruges is a grown up genre film not because it hangs out in galleries and cathedrals like a tapestry woven by Brueghel's mistress from blood, sin, and judgement. Though it does.

In Bruges is a black comedy for grown ups not because it consciously satisfies our skulking childishness, our 'incorrect' urge to lash out at convention , say f*ck the lot 'o ya's, fist someone in the mouth for good measure and then offer a fast talking and wickedly funny apology. And it does all that too.

In Bruges is grown up cinema because despite being sexy, fun and stylish, it is emotionally literate. Is that allowed?

The complexity of Martin McDonagh's screen play is manifold, developing and delineating character through dialogue as much as action. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel inhabit their characters with equal and at times forceful skill, displaying flawless comic timing and sensitivity. Together they breathe 'real life' into the hyperbolic corpse of a bloated genre that never quite realised it died some time ago. McDonagh's characters realise too late they've been c*nts, one way or another, and far too late, begin to grow. Characters with history, in emotional distress, barely conscious or all too aware. They do what we might in their shoes. And as they trace the outline of their own destruction in lines of cocaine or spilled beer, their conceit, self loathing, compassion or stubbornness lays them all bare. There is a cost for all of them, characters on a human scale, acting out their tragedy in recognisable terms. In Bruges is as morally instructive as it is dramatically satisfying, almost becoming a medieval mystery play in the setting of the title.

Finally In Bruges is a dangerously perfect fusion of plot, meaning and story. Ripples of understanding run back and forth across the surface of the experience, hinting at the themes which swim powerfully beneath. A film this genuinely startling doesn't happen very often.

Went to see it for the setting. Loved it for the dialogue. Wished it had just gone a bit further.

In Bruges is a dark comedy set in the beautiful medieval town of Bruges, Belgium, featuring an Irish duo of hit men who have been ordered by their boss to hide out there after a high-profile job in London went sour. Their instructions are to keep a low profile, sightsee, and generally avoid trouble until further notice.

But all is not as it seems.

The dialogue between Gleeson and Farrell is witty, delivered with perfect comic timing, zany, and a joy to watch. Farrell and the charming Clémence Poésy also have great chemistry and are fun to watch on screen. The humour is designed to make viewers uncomfortable, and succeeds remarkably on this count. If you're looking for political correctness, you won't find it here. What you will find are jabs at Americans, tourists, gays, blacks, whites, fat people, and oh yeah, midgets. As this odd assortment of characters mixes and mingles in the streets of Bruges, the tension builds.

And there's just enough of a psychological dark edge to keep things interesting. This is a comedy, yes, but it's by no means light and fluffy. This movie has been compared to The Big Hit or The Whole Nine Yards, but in fact, it's much, much darker. And in my opinion, that makes it better.

Shot entirely on location in Bruges, the backdrop is of course stunning. I originally went to see this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title, simply because, having visited Bruges, I couldn't resist an opportunity to see it on the big screen. Filmed in the wintertime and largely at night, Bruges itself is one of the stars of the movie. Like the other characters, it is not portrayed as light, airy, innocent or picturesque, the way it is in real life. Instead, its more haunting quality is captured elegantly on film, with a heavy mist giving the town a sort of eerie, dream-like quality.

So much of this movie was just right, and I highly recommend it to people who like twisted humour and aren't easily offended.

I have two issues with this film, however. The first is the score. The music is completely wrong for this movie, giving it a feel that doesn't work at all with the dark comedy tone. The melancholy, slow, stirring music would've worked nicely with a drama or a psychological period piece, but just seems out of place here.

The second issue is with the ending. Nope, I won't give it away. Suffice to say, I thought it was wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. Almost as though the author couldn't figure out what to do next or how to end this thing.

But overall, I really enjoyed In Bruges. It was wickedly funny, daringly different, and fantastically non-PC. And the shots of Bruges are wonderful. Despite what the main characters say about the place, Bruges is really quite wonderful. I suggest seeing both the movie and the city.

The films that I find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds - the best and the worst. In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.

Some of the comments posted seem to take exception to the fact that In Bruges is difficult to categorise - that terrible compulsion of the film industry to fit every film into a "genre". This is a film that is genuinely uncategorisable. It is often very funny, sometimes poignant and touching, sometimes darkly frightening, always thought-provoking. To categorise it as, say, a "comedy-thriller" would be to seriously sell its qualities short.

There is one very good reason for the film's special elusive quality - it is very Irish. Although strictly speaking it would not count as an Irish production and Martin McDonagh was born in London, all his stage writing stems from a strong Irish sensibility and it is no accident that the two leading characters are played by Irish actors (albeit actors familiar to an American audience playing Americans!). The ability to see pathos behind humour, as well as the funny side of tragedy, is a peculiarly Irish trait.

The brilliance of the script is matched by superb performances from the two leads as well as all the supporting cast, however small the part. The only weak link (and it is a very minor criticism) is Ralph Fiennes as the boss figure who, as one other posting commented, was more convincing on the phone than in person, perhaps, as many have pointed out, because of unfavourable comparison with Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. Brendan Gleeson is, as always, impeccable, Colin Farrell gives his best performance since Intermission, both are subtle and totally believable. The supporting characters are so effective partly because they are very well cast, partly because they have been written with such attention to detail. Almost my favourite moment is when the hotel owner hands over a phone message from the boss, carefully typed out including all the obscenities, with a personal hand-written correction at the bottom - "I am not the receptionist...".

I am hoping that by writing the above I will be able to stop myself thinking about In Bruges, but somehow I doubt it!

Martin McDonagh is a new name for me but it reeks of sounds and smells I recognize and love. Joe Ortonish if you know what I mean. A mishmash of blame and redemption in Bruges of all places. Colin Farrell is superb as the child killer devoured by his own conscience. His dialogue is brutally funny but if we follow his eyes he's stuck on the same place. The child, his death....Brendan Gleeson's interest in Bruges and what Bruges has to offer is hysterically funny and deeply moving. A monumental performance. Ralph Finnes in a totally new vest (if you forget Schindler's) comes to revolutionize the third act with a few aces up his sleeve. He is as much fun to watch as he is frightening. An unexpected treat. I highly recommend it.

First off, I'd like to mention that this IS a Black Comedy, it's meant to be funny in a morbid way. Also, this is not a movie that should be seen for those with a faint heart as is suggested by the 18A rating (in Canada at least, no idea for other countries).

Moving on, I have to say that this was a great movie, much better than I anticipated and I was already ready for something fantastic. The scenery and music are really amazing, especially as a balance to the extremely foul and crude language that are rampant. Though that might put some people off it adds to the hilarity of the situation, the contrast between this beautiful and melancholic music and scenery and the dialog that goes on between the two main characters.

There is, of course, a great deal of violence, but that is to be expected of a movie about hit men. THe fact that everything took place in Bruges makes it all the more funny, especially with all the jokes that are made about both the town and Belgium in general.

There is much more that I can say but I think that the film should speak for itself, go watch it. Please do keep in mind though that this is not a slap-stick comedy, nor a sit-com as generally perceived. A lot of it is laughing at the absurdity of what is happening and the dialog which is witty and great. Once again, go watch the movie, you won't regret it.

"In Bruges" was a huge disappointment, especially considering the unending praise this movie has been drawing from critics and viewers alike.

I thought it was very false, and contrived.

The movie centers on two professional hit men from Ireland, rationalising what they do for a living, i.e. killing people for money, by telling themselves that most of the people they've killed weren't very nice anyway, so kinda had it coming/only got their comeuppance. At the same time, they do of course have very appropriate pangs of conscience about the few people they killed who may not have deserved it. Generally speaking I don't care for movies about contract killers ("Grosse Pointe Blank" being another example) which depict their protagonists in a naïve, romanticised way: Yeah, here are these two paid killers, but don't be put off by what they do for a living, they're really quite friendly people, so long as you don't end up on their hitlist! In fact, even if you do end up on their hitlist, they are still going to be friendly to you, although they are going to have to kill you, but that's strictly business, nothing personal! There is a scene where one of them relates how he had to kill a man he wasn't paid to kill  the man just stood in his way trying to protect a relative who was on the assassin's hitlist. The scene turns into a mock argument about whether or not he shot the man in self-defence, with the two talking at cross points, or rather Colin Farrell's character pretending to be too obtuse to see the other guy's point. The scene is clearly meant to be hilarious. I had no inclination to smile.

One thing I am really sick of in English-language movies (not only this one) is all these Continental European supporting characters with absolutely flawless English, in this case Colin Farrell's enormously annoying Belgian love interest. Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like "Wow, your English is really good", and that's that. On to the next pun.

Another thing I am tired of is all these regular people with superhuman courage in the face of extreme danger, in this case an extremely pregnant(!) hotel owner who never wavers for a second as she stands in the way of an armed madman, in defiance of the danger to her own life and that of her unborn baby. Right. If there was anybody in the real world who would really act this way, it wouldn't be courageous, it would be plain stupid.

There is one scene of such colossal absurdity, I can't help but relate it. A man is first shot in the leg, then he hobbles down the winding stairs of a bell tower (albeit propped up by another man, to be fair), then he gets shot into the throat or maybe shoulder, then he drags himself back up the same winding staircase (this time without the help of the other man), then  once at the top  he drags himself onto the parapet of said bell tower to stand erect(!) upon the parapet before hurling himself down. There is a massive cloud of blood as he hits the ground. I won't reveal what happens next, let's just say the guy is of an impressive resilience.

Almost as absurd is the ending which has the five leads all in the same place at the same time, so the movie can conveniently deal with them one after the other until all emotional and outer conflicts are neatly resolved, in a way that could only have been contrived by a director who comes from theater.

I am giving this movie a liberal 2 out of 10 stars, the lowest rating I have given any movie since Terry Gilliam's "Brothers Grimm". If you want to see an honest movie about a paid assassin, watch the original "Day of the Jackal". That movie too centered on a man who killed for a living, but unlike "In Bruges" it never tries to coax the viewer into sympathising with its protagonist. Instead, it deals with its subject matter-of-factly: he's a contract killer, ruthless and despicable.

Atrocious film-making. Two morons, that by the end we're meant to find adorable, arrive in Bruges for some sinister mission. What follows is basically a hate filled diatribe humiliating gay men (shock horror), dwarfs and women. There's no sophistication in the supposedly brilliant writing. It's the kind of lousy movie that seems to have been inspired by rednecks and writing on toilet walls in pubs.

Reading some of the reviews of this film is mind boggling. Most harp on and on about Farrell's redemption but given that this particular element in the script is so utterly unconvincing (Is this what McDonaugh considers irony?) and simply used as a device to validate Farrell's rampant homophobia and misogyny-the result is sickening, not illuminating.

Yes, Bruges looks wonderful but who cares when you're watching offensive rubbish of this nature. Painful.

If you haven't seen this film then go and see it but PLEASE don't read on until you have.

I saw it last night on pay TV and how I wished I'd seen it on the big screen. It has stayed with me all day.Like the song in your head that wont go away.

I guess from the look of it that it was shot on some species of digital camera...(I saw from the credits they used an Arri, but there were credits for Delux and a neg cutter..?..!) 

It would have made sense to have shot this on HD as a wet night in a city lit by practicals cries our for it. The photography was wonderful, not in that it delivered a slide show of gorgeous frames, but that you felt you were there. It wasn't there to show off but to drive the story along, part of the narrative.You could feel your warm top coat around you as you sat in the sidewalk café, you could taste the cold strong beer and the cool night air on your face. 

Mr McDonah is a vivid talent and for a feature film débutant shows an amazing sureness of touch. of course he has already won an Oscar for his short film, obviously a good training ground! I'll light a candle for him that his next film is just as good but completely different.Then we will know a new star has risen.(Oh that difficult second album!)

The writing, as in any film, is the most important element and the bizarre, strangely formal, dialogue, especially Harry's ,was to hear screen writing at its electrifying best.The samurai-like code of honour of the killers just added to the grown up fairy-tale feel. Towne and Tarantino on a good day. 

As actors Gleason and Fiennes were, as ever, beyond criticism,simply faultless.

Everyone who writes about Colin Farrell begins with the disclaimer that they are 'not a fan', well I guess he's not the most likable of people. But his performance in this was pure gold.Spectacular. Part Dougal Mcguire (Father Ted) and part Stan Laurel yet convincingly tough. The brutal violence had a real Tom and Jerry slapstick to it and was perfectly judged. As were the accompanying quotable lines"Thats for John Lennon yer fokin yankee khont" as he punches out the obnoxious fellow diner who, despite sitting in the smoking section, complains about their smoking...we have ALL met him..if you haven't then you ARE him! 

Once again the director has shown himself true officer material to get such a wonderful performance from a difficult, but gifted actor."OK Colin today you're going to karate-chop a dwarf." (I think there was a nod to "Living in Oblivion" there.)

Like 'The Birds' this movie sets out as a comedy but ends in a glimpse of Hell,There is a real medieval Catholic perception of sin, guilt and retribution running through this like the words in a stick of rock ( to quote Graham Greene, another obvious influence)

Like the final journey to Hell as portrayed by Heronimous Bosch,this film too is a haunting, disturbing, dazzling work of of art.

"If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't." I've never grown up, certainly not on a farm, and, as for the other criterion, it is best left to others to judge, but I was impressed by "In Bruges!" The sights of the Belgian town itself would make an attractive documentary and they serve as a perfect counterpoint to the sardonic humor that emanates from the characters from beginning to end of this film.

When the "frozen mist" appears over the town, it becomes a "fairy tale" landscape, well, a fairy tale that includes hit men in repose; a girl on a film crew who sells a pharmacopoeia of drugs when not shilling for a skinhead who shoots blanks, figuratively and literally, fat Americans; boorish Canadians; rumors of a midget - excuse me - "dwarf" race war; very funny and very dark casual conversations; a horror in flashback and one of the bloodiest and most ethical shootouts to ever conclude a movie.

Colin Farrell apparently has the current franchise on guilt-ridden, semi-clueless and almost entirely heedless characters who inadvertently plague their partners given his recent showing in Woody Allen's "Cassandra's Dream." In the previous film his character treads water barely keeping his guilt afloat in the pervasive gloom while in "Bruges" he swims with it on his back through dark and unforced humor and regret. Brendan Gleason provides a sturdy framework for the plot and the revelation of character. Clearly, it is one of his best performances - a hit-man with the face and fidelity of an old knight errant. Ralph Fiennes also sets the perfect tone as the criminal nobleman to whom Farrell and Gleason both owe allegiance and must confront with reluctant defiance. The erstwhile Fleur Delacour of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Clémence Poésy, plays the drug dealer/mugger assistant with a (sort of) heart of gold (And, no, for once, that's not Peter Dinklage, the hardest working little person in movies, it's Jordan Prentice.) This appears to be director/writer's Martin McDonagh's full-length feature debut. Kudos!

I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the "adult language" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word "F***" is used in IB.

Gleeson and Farrell make a great seriocomic team as Ken and Ray, two Irish hit men who have suspenseful and surreal adventures hiding out in Belgium in the magnificent city of Bruges after their latest job goes horribly, heartbreakingly wrong. They're the ultimate odd-couple tourists as they await further instructions from their boss, with Ken enjoying the sightseeing and the swans as Ray spews forth befuddled, unfavorable, hilariously un-PC opinions of just about everything and everyone he encounters, except a pretty Flemish production assistant (Clemence Poesy of 127 HOURS), who's as full of surprises as our undercover assassins. Farrell gives one of his very best performances, blending laugh-out-loud comedy and guilt-ridden heartache beautifully. My favorite running gag was Ray's childlike fascination with dwarfs, and his oafish but well-meant concern for cokehead dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), who's in the fairytale-like city to appear in a dream sequence in a local indie art-house flick. As Harry, the boys' crime boss, Ralph Fiennes does a terrific job channeling Sir Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Don in SEXY BEAST (I assure you, that's a compliment!). IB mixes suspense, melancholia, and hilarity very well indeed. Along with THE BANK JOB, IB was my favorite crime film of 2008. The DVD's featurettes and deleted scenes are fun, too, including interviews, a captioned boat tour of Bruges, and a deleted scene involving Matt Smith in his pre-DOCTOR WHO days -- and a machete! The many deleted scenes are all quite entertaining; I'm sure they were only cut so IB wouldn't be a 3-hour epic! :-)

This is one of those awesome films that a viewer will either love or hate...there is no in-between.

If you love it, you must have a twisted, wicked sense of humor, an open mind enough to truly appreciate well-written, intelligent dialogue and an imagination that will go along w/a plot that LOOKS like it is two jig-saw puzzles mixed together...until it all comes together brilliantly in the last 30 minutes. Add in a performance from Colin Farrell that is SO different from the arrogant A-type character he usually plays...his "dumb" character is actually funny in this one.

At the industry screening here in LA several "older types" walked out early...maybe because of the liberal use of the F-word...but the majority stayed to debate the ending and "why" it had to end the way it did.

For those who hated it: you're too stupid to understand an intelligent, thought-provoking film when you see one.

It gets 1 star for the lovely travelogue of Bruges, seeing a Heironymous Bosch and maybe another star for not having a happy ending.

-The dialogue was atrocious. Worst of all - it was uninteresting and not amusing. I am even more horrified to learn that this was written by a playwright not some 15 year old watching too many Tarantino films & thinking he's being hip/ironic by making fun of midgets, swearing every 3 seconds & having his characters be amoral and unsympathetic.

-The characters were not only all uninteresting and unsympathetic they were all boring. Yes, we get it, they're pathetic, Ray's not very bright, they have no other future, they're amoral, most of the people are violent, homophobic, and racist... but they feel a little bad when kids die. There was NO personal growth on any of their parts - a tiny bit of remorse maybe, no sense of an attempt at redemption (Ray is literally CONFUSED about the concept when Ken tries to spell it out for him). -Ken's sacrifice for Ray came out of nowhere and made no sense (he claims Ray has a chance to change-- there is NO indication from Ray that he will redeem himself or change *in the slightest*!). -There were no interesting/novel action bits or shooting. -Nearly every "twist" was obvious and foreseeable (what the "instructions" would be, what Ken was doing in the park, most of the ending). -I enjoy most of Ralplh Fiennes movies (other than Maid in Manhattan) but his role here was a waste of time. Unstable evil guy. Absolutely nothing new or even really fleshed out.

It was painful and an utter waste of my time! It was derivative and pointless. It didn't entertain me, it didn't make me think, it didn't challenge me, it didn't show me anything new (other than scenery of Bruges), it didn't amuse me (I chuckled maybe twice).

If you want a good European locale + action film with character development and clever dialogue watch Hot Fuzz instead. If you want a quirky film about a hit-man thinking about his job & falling in love, rent Grosse Point Blank.

Hit men Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to lay low for a while and await a call from their criminal boss Harry. They are meant to stay near the phone in the evening and are free to sightsee during the day but Ray is less than impressed with his surroundings even in Ken is soaking it all in. While they await further instructions, the two talk over things, travel round the city, get involved with some of the cast and crew making a film and generally fail to stay out of trouble or maintain a low profile.

In Bruges was sold as a hilarious comedy and this in combination with the names involved made me want to check it out. It was mis-sold but this is not to say that the film still wasn't pretty good. It is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny but it is only occasionally and mostly the tone is very black, with humour coming laced with violence. On the flip of this approach though the film does still have a plot where the characters are in danger and it does still expect to pack a narrative and emotional punch. Both sides are OK but they do not work as well together as I would have liked. When it is funny the film is brilliant, with great lines juxtapositioning with the often violent situations they are in and this darkly comic stuff really appealed to me but the downside is that it does make it harder to suddenly launch into a more dramatic film where we really need to feel the danger. This is difficult given we have just watched danger being dealt with in a comic and offhand way, so my heart was not really in it in the later stages of the film.

When the violence is handled with humour, it doesn't bother me much but the gore and the impact of the violence is pretty harshly depicted, which again makes the film a little hard to "enjoy" in the way I was in the first half of the movie. Really it needed to go one way or the other for definite so that there was an overall direction for the film because, as it is, it does feel like two different approaches with a reasonable blend in the middle. The cast make it work though and you can see from their performances that they know they are the whole show here. Farrell impressed me with his comedy abilities and although he did remind me of Father Dougal at times, he is really good here, getting laughs and being able to deliver sudden brutality. Gleeson is equally good and the film is great when the two of them are allowed to play off one another. Fiennes helps the latter stages of the film work because his performance is strong  injecting dark energy into the film just when it needed something to carry it across the end. Reuten and Prentice are OK but are very much secondary to the main three.

Overall In Bruges is not a brilliant or hilarious film but it does more or less work and entertain throughout. The darker it gets the less it works and the ending is not as strong as the first half of the film but mostly the darkly comic and brutal material does work thanks to the really good playing from the three main actors, while Bruges itself provides a picturesque background. Come to it with low expectations and it will probably charm and engage you but it is not quite as good as some would have you believe.

Where to begin on this film? "In Bruges" is simply the most original films that I have seen in a long while. Martin McDonagh has written a hilarious dark comedic adventure. The story is very intriguing, but the characters are shear genius, and they are improved with the perfect cast.

Many people will pass this up on these bases: I've never heard of it; It is a British film; and Colin Farrel is in it.

I am openly admitting that before I saw this film, I did not care for Colin Farrel and I was not a fan of his acting. He redeems himself in this role. His deep and comedic portrayal of his character cannot be missed, not to mention Brendan Gleeson's astounding work and Ralph Fiennes doing one hell of a performance. Even the smaller characters are so very interesting.

This film is a must see! Don't miss out on "In Bruges"!

After watching the film for the third time, I have just read through a number of the comments posted by others here; yes, the struggle with guilt is identified, and the great acting (especially Farrell), and the dark comedy. But has no one else seen an allegory in the film? Early on in the film, Ray & Ken view a painting in a museum, and discuss that it represents Purgatory; the ending takes place in a film shoot of...Purgatory. Principles. Guilt. Hell...prison...or the light above...

I just hope that those who see it as merely an addition to the Pulp Fiction genre will 'hear' the depth of the film, if only on a subconscious level.

And, the soundtrack is perfect.

After a contract killing goes disastrously wrong, two hit men are told by their boss, the foul-mouthed Harry, to hide out in Bruges. So they head for Bruges, even though they have no idea why they have been sent there, or even where Bruges is. It's in Belgium. In Bruges, the two hit men are forced to come to terms with their own inner demons, and they are doomed to face the consequences of their actions.

It is easy to spot that Martin McDonagh, the writer and director of In Bruges, is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this is the type of movie Tarantino would have made, had he been born in Dublin and not Knoxville, Tennessee. Every Tarantino trademark, from the Mexican standoff to the retrospective storytelling, is brilliantly executed in this film. In addition, the use of piquant and pervading dialogue to build McDonagh's characters and drive the narrative is also superbly executed. Tarantino would be proud. However, this film is not just another Quentin Tarantino knockoff by a British director. Apart from the obvious nods to Tarantino, there are other elements that make this an interesting and distinctly entertaining film. The film is shot on location in Bruges, a small, picturesque town in Belgium, of which most people probably have never heard. Bruges is portrayed as a town steeped in history and religious lore. And, despite Farrell's character, Ray, saying it is a "s******e" at every possible opportunity, Bruges looks quite exquisite on the big screen. If it is to be the last place you see before you die, it is definitely a beautiful place to go.

Another key ingredient of this exemplary film is the tour de force performances by the three leads and supporting cast. Colin Farrell, in my opinion, has never really lived up to his early promise. Farrell has had more misses than hits, but his performance in In Bruges shows that he has impeccable comic timing and can also deliver a performance that is, at the same time, both subtle and poignant. Gleason is superb, as usual, as the older and wiser hit-man, who cannot bring himself to punish Farrell's character for his gruesome mistake. And, finally, Ralph Fiennes drops the repressed upper-class-Englishman guise that he usually adopts and plays the frenetic, foul-mouthed gangster with gusto.

In Bruges does get very dark at times, for a film that is billed as a comedy; thus, some viewers will be put off. But, I believe its propensity to shock you one minute and make you laugh the next is one of the film's strongest qualities. Although the writer-director was born in London, it is obvious that there are many strong Irish influences in his life. And, these Irish influences are very evident in his writing.

In Bruges, is a darkly comic film, with lashings of Catholic guilt throughout. Its strength lies in its outstanding characterisations and its ultra-sharp dialogue. In Bruges is an example of screen writing at its finest and the film is destined to become a classic. Even better still, it is a first-rate advertisement for the city of Bruges. And, after watching the film, I know I want to go there!
