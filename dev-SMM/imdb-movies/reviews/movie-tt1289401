### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
As far as the end result... ...the film completely fell flat across the board. I have nothing against the four leads. I more or less blame the writers, director and the studios choice of direction for the new Ghostbusters.

The acting is some of the most stiff and cookie cutter I have ever seen. There were times when it really sounded like they were reading their lines. The actors did NOT mesh well at all and their interaction with all of the blue and green screen effects was lifeless and clueless.

I was just lost with the approach on their attempted humor. I mean, it's bad. I don't know what panel sat around the table reading the script and laughed at it, but I hope they never do again.

The effects were horrible. Every time, which was A LOT, they used a green screen, I found myself taken away from the movie.

The film constantly contradicts it's own established continuity. One minute they can't kill the ghosts, only contain them, the next, they can. Just ridiculous.

They even added a segment to the movie early on that shows the four girls poking fun at all of the hate for the film. I just don't think the studio gets it. 

More mocking of the very people they expect to pay top dollar for their product.

Despite all of the sexist remarks towards the movie, the movie itself is EXTREMELY sexist against men and borderline racist. All men are portrayed as fools in the movie and in order to kill the final villain they have to shoot him in the crotch. 

It almost seems the team behind the film knew how stereotypical and sexist their movie was, so they capitalized on the sexism against the film in order to hide that.

I honestly recommend wearing a padded glove when you watch this, IF you watch this. I have never face-palmed so many times during a movie in my life. I would not suggest this film to anyone except maybe children under ten years old and even then, it would simply be for a cartooned 3D experience.

I wish I could find positives because I dislike being so negative about a film. I understand completely the amount of work that goes into something like this. Chris Hemsworth was probably the best part of this believe or not. I could see him leading a team of his own Ghostbusters in another version if written correctly.

But I can't help but quote Jurassic Park concerning the very idea of this film.

The filmmakers "were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."

I really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype. But, the film was not funny and does not stand on it's own. Honestly, the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast.

I will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers, various clips, TV spots, etc., you would have been thinking correctly. Sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases. Let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were.

If someone were to ask me if they should go see it, I would say, "No, but if you are curious, just wait for it to become available for Internet streaming."

I don't think people will walk away from this movie afraid of ghosts. I imagine they walk away afraid of the movie and more so, the people who thought it was wise to make it in the first place.

There is some irony here. Ghostbusters 2016 has literally become a ghost. It was dead on arrival.

I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.

I was unfortunate enough to see an early screening with a friend and... man, this movie isn't bad; it's TERRIBLE. BEYOND TERRIBLE. 

It's getting mixed to positive reviews, but the people liking this movie are the same people who jumped on-board the feminist "everyone who hates this film is a misogynist" train and they don't even mention anything beyond the parts they cherry-picked to like in the movie. Throughout the hour and a half + movie, the movie made a desperate attempt to be good to the point where it just appeared like they were trying too hard. Much of the humor is forced and most of the jokes are basic and can be seen/guessed even before the scene rolls. At times, it felt cheap and lazy. I thought I was watching a failing SNL parody rather than a good movie.

Leslie Jones is another problem; she portrays a stereotypical black woman with an attitude. Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character. 

Also, it's Reverse Sexism in a film. Instead of treating both genders equally, Paul Feig displays men as idiots or assholes. This is true with Hemsworth's character, Kevin, who is the team's secretary. He's completely stupid, clueless and innocent; but mostly stupid. Janine in the original film was a smart, capable woman who had a lot of memorable moments and wasn't portrayed in a sexist, if not really unattractive manner. I almost walked out of the early screening because of how poorly men were portrayed in the film. And, probably, by now, everyone has heard of the atrocious final resolution to the final battle. SPOILER ALERT: SKIP IF YOU WANNA ACTUALLY SEE THIS BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE.

The final battle is resolved by shooting Rowan in the dick. That's right; four chicks shoot Rowan in the dick with their proton packs. -.- You probably already know this because of the GIF floating around the inter-webs, but, yeah. That's how the final battle ends; a really sexist approach to finishing the film. It sounds mild, but combine this with the portrayal of Kevin, Bill Murray's cameo and a few other male characters who interact with the main characters and you have a feminist film ready to go.

Along with these criticisms come with the really bad script that just acts like imitation crab in the food world; it's just an imitation. In fact, half the plot imitates the original in a distasteful manner that just really turns off Ghostbusters fans. It's unoriginal and it pays little homage to the films. When it does, it does it in lackluster fashion. Like, for example, Stay Puft's official sighting in this film is in parade balloon form, not true marshmallow form. If you were expecting at least one showdown with the destructive Puft himself, think again. He has been replaced by the logo ghost. XD 

There's so much wrong with this movie, but these things are just a few of them. Thanks Paul Feig for messing Ghosbusters up. I guess Paul's been Busted and it felt good busting' this travesty of a film that will haunt GB fans for generations.

PROS: -Chris Hemsworth (For the most part) -Complete relief when the film ended

CONS: -Terrible acting -Abismal writing -Huge gaping plot holes (Like the inability to buy the firehouse but the ability to create advanced ghost busting technology and obtain parts and equipment.) -Poor CGI effects -Disrespectful cameos and treatment of original material -Reverse sexist message -A stereotypical caricature of a black woman (Leslie Jones as Patty) -Useless inclusion of Patty into the GB team -Non-existent character chemistry -Disappointing final battle which breaks all GB rules first established in the film -Unmemorable soundtrack -Poor editing -Inappropriate responses to constructive criticism hidden in film -Dull, ineffective, dry forced-humor -Identity crisis (Reboot or Sequel. Choose one, Feig.) -Laughable film effort in general

This film is BUSTED and busting this travesty of a film makes me feel good; better than good... GREAT.

I've never seen the original Ghostbusters films, so I went into watching this with quite an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing though, the CGI was terrible and reminded me of the early 2000s live action Scooby Doo films, the girls, who I'd imagine are funny in their own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry between them and oddly enough Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin ended up being the most funny aspect of the film. 

That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see the film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he revealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went because he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it didn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment.

Some people are saying that this is the wort movie of all time. It is not. It is merely a really bad movie with no redeeming qualities, and it insults your intelligence.

And, most of the YouTube videos made slamming it are 100s of times funnier than this movie.

Seriously, the movie is just not funny. In fact Batman and Robin (George Clooney and whoever played Robin) had more humor in it than this movie does, and that movie was worse than this one--that is how not funny this movie is. 

Save your money. Read a cereal box. It will cost less and be funnier.

Awful but not necessarily for the reason you would expect.

Despite some early reviews I've read or watched I didn't find the movie to be anti-male. There was nothing offensively anti-man in it that wasn't something I've already seen before and laughed off a million times. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with humor creativity. There was nothing there to laugh about.

Thankfully Patty Tolan isn't a walking/talking stereotype. They made her a New York City historian instead of a caricature with "street smarts". Sadly, they didn't do her any other favors. Nor were the other characters flushed out at all.

Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play a pair of old friends who re-unite but I never get much of a sense they were anything but aware they were in a movie. They try to riff and play off each other but it kind of falls flat.

Kate McKinnon's character stands out the most in this movie. The character just seemed too weird in an unrealistic way. She seemed to try chewing up scenery any time she was on a call sheet, even if she didn't have much to say. She didn't feel like she fit into what was happening.

One actress that stood out to me was Cecily Strong. Cecily Strong stood out to me the same way Kristen Wiig first stood out to me in Knocked Up. She only has a very small role in the movie but she's able to be convincing and funny without making it seem like she's in on the joke.

The performances weren't bad per se, they were just very underwhelming all-around. As a result, the film itself does not succeed.

I did like how the ghosts look in the movie. I also like the choice the filmmakers make at the end regarding the classic logo. However I have to be harsh on this movie because it's a reboot that ultimately did not need to be made.

Not only did they attempt to reboot a comedy (tell the same joke twice in a row and see how well it works the second time - comedy is a very very delicate thing and you need to respect the audience) but they went for a movie that originally caught lightning in a bottle. I don't even think Ghostbusters II did enough to justify existing. Maybe the lessons we didn't learn back when the sequel was made are the same lessons we won't learn from the reboot.

As fan of the original movies it's sad to see the extreme change of direction here. The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details, but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling, exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes. 

In the original movies, Ivan Reitman was the real nerd-scientist who outsmarted anyone in any room; Dan Aykroyd was the doomsday historian who really had some fun lines in his movie-fact-based monologues about evil; Bill Murray was a jerk, but he had a journey about improving himself, that made him likable; And Ernie Hudson started out as this "I don't care about anything as long as I get paid"-guy. This diverse group found something together that created a friendship based on real-felt trust, and they became a good team to hunt ghosts and save people. There was a real journey there. I don't feel the journey on this new one, I really don't.

Because... I want the old comedy, not this lightheaded piece of "refurbished material" (to use a non-angry term). The original movies were about Individuals having believable comedic and heartfelt separate journeys, while I feel this movie is all about characters playing stupid, fast-paced jokes on each other. All the time.. When there are some hints of emotions in this movie I don't believe in it..

So much that I give it a 1. Normally the 1 is reserved, by me, for zero-budget independent movies with actors with incoherent dialogue delivering, and a photo that lacks the technical craft-ship to give us a believable understanding of the surroundings. This one is made by real Hollywood people, but you know what they say:

You can't polish a "refurbished material"!

Against all reasoning I decided to watch the full movie remake. Where can I begin. First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.

They should have cut the remainder of the movie 15 minutes in and replaced it with old Godzilla footage. Maybe have Melissa McCarthy stomping on toy trucks and cars.

Honestly, I didn't care about the gender swap that much so long as the film would be a good watch. But it wasn't. it was a terrible, unfunny waste of my time and every other poor soul who had the painful misfortune of having to sit and bear witness to this god awful, inane, inept and pathetic excuse for entertainment. Not a single moment did this wretched movie give me the tiniest iota of anything that would resemble pleasure. Not a single joke made me laugh, not for any second could this film make me muster up a single emotion other than pure anger and disgust, I didn't care about any of the main characters and was so detached from them that if all 4 characters died horribly in the film I would have less of an emotion than I do when I flush my excrement down the toilet. Further-more just to give you an idea of how comprehensively bored i was, I found myself looking at my watch at a point in the film hoping it would be nearing it's end only to find that the film was only 30 minutes into it's running time. I abhor, despise, loathe and resent this movie and plea to anyone reading this to avoid this movie like the plague that it is. In fact I retract that statement as frankly comparing this film to the plague would be an insult to the plague as it has far more reason to exist than this film does.

Are you kidding me, even Ghostbusters rip off films or YouTube movies are better than is garbage. What were they thinking, the movie sucks, the trailers, the posters suck, everything about it sucks. I don't mind that they are girls, it is time for a change, but it was so wrong, the jokes were not funny, the lines are terrible and all over they suck. There are 4 dances in this movie, why!!!!!!!!!, why is there dances, and by the way they suck as well, I would rather watch Bill Mury take a dump than watch this movie. I beg you, don't watch this movie, it will destroy you and destroy Ghostbusters. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!. There is nothing good about this movie, nothing!. Why did they reboot Ghostbusters, the studio had the chance to do Ghostbusters 3, but no...they make a unfunny, goofy, crap, waste, garbage movie. I wish they didn't makes this movie, I rather watch X Men Origins Wolverine than is movie. I don't want anyone to watch this movie, it is the devil to Ghostbusters film, it suck so much that I sucks more than Terminator Salvation. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!

How could someone green-light this movie from just the writing alone? I knew this was a horrible movie going in, and yet I still tried to watch it. All I could handle was the first 20 minutes before I shut it off and returned to watching the original Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters-2. You know what the biggest difference between the original movies and this horrible excuse for a movie? The first 20 minutes of the original two movies were fun, interesting, and not over-the-top with obscenities, sexism, or had any jokes that came close to talking about anything on the level of queefing in a "family" movie. In fact, this movie had a LOT of raunchiness that the original two movies never had. You have to be desperate to find any level of raunchiness in the original Ghostbusters movies. The closest thing that people could call "raunchy" was in "Ghostbusters 2" in the scene where Janine Melnitz begins hitting on Louis Tully. That whole segment was the most sexually explicit scene of either of the two movies, yet it was still tame in comparison to the references made inside the first 25 minutes of this schlock adaptation.

I really wanted to like this movie. I like the other work of the lead actors. The repeated use of crude, stupid humor killed the movie - the first time I watched it I turned it off after 40 minutes in disgust and annoyance. When I gave it the full chance, I wished that I had stopped at 40 again. The women characters were portrayed as unprofessional- unfamiliar with their tools and amateurish in their actions. Compare their behavior to the men in the original movie - those characters were eccentric and inexperienced, but deliberate and not constantly mugging in that "aren't I so funny" way. This could and should have been a much better movie.

I've read conflicting reviews about this film and decided to watch it to gain my own perspective. I have no option but to say I'm disappointed to a furious degree. This could have been an amazing reboot, but is the antithesis thereof. The female cast was a great idea, but in the first movies the guys came across as comedic, goofy at most, yet mildly serious. I don't understand why the ladies were painted a shade away from moronic cartoon characters? Honestly, there are young writers and filmmakers out there with real talent and amazing stories to tell that are dying to get their work taken seriously and yet this kind of rubbish gets approved and funded? Nothing about the cast or visuals bother me, it could have all worked but the script and direction is loutish at best. I don't even understand what age group this was aimed at as I don't feel it works for any. Everything in this film could have been better with better writing and better direction, I feel it was robbed of both. The amount of time wasted on pointless dialogue and cheesy banter nearly made me stop the film and watch something else. I'm not being nasty or spiteful here, I unapologetically call this a waste of time and money for the people who made it, were a part of it or watched it. The only positive of this film for me and I mean this kindly, is that it offered employment to those involved. This is possibly the worst film I've watched 2016 to present.

Felt rushed, little original plot, too many things crammed in from the first two. The ghosts felt extremely weak and underdeveloped/not inspired.

It gets one star for having the name Ghostbusters and one star for the original cast's cameo and that is about it.

Remakes and reboots are generally sad and this was even sadder. It just plain disappointed this girl. The supreme big ghost was a complete unimaginative joke compared to an actual spirit that is evil. The original ghostbusters need to come back, that is the only thing that can save this mess of a beginning to a new guaranteed series. The ghostbusters universe otherwise is much better without this unfunny nonsense.

Having been a big fan of the original movie and watched the trailers for this one I was really looking forward to it but was massively disappointed: - They had the cast! - They had 2016 special effects capability! - They had $144M budget! - They had a great director! - They had cameos from most of the surviving original cast! - They had a trailer with some good gags! - They even had some good founding concepts!

What happened to this movie?!?!?! How did that script happen?!?!?

This movie had so much potential which has just been completely wasted.

It didn't start off too badly despite the main characters just spouting long strings of physics related words that even in sci-fi should exist in the same sentence (It is like the director just said say random words and we will fix it in post - I suspect it was supposed to be funny - it wasn't). 

For the most part it felt like it was written in sections by people who only had a brief overview of what happened in the other sections.

There were some funny bits mostly provided by Leslie Jones. But that didn't make up for the fact they pretty much gave up on any kind of humour half way through.

The special effects just ramped up and got tackier through the movie. The effects themselves looked like those used in Batman & Robin (The 1997 version with Arnie and Clooney)!

I suppose this is one way to kill off a franchise reboot. Maybe they will try again in another 10 years or so...

I wish this film had never been made.

I now find myself having to refer to Ghostbusters (1984) as the original - something that grieves me greatly, as this film and even Ghostbusters 2 were great films, compared to this. And the former is one of my all time favourites.

I'm just glad I didn't watch it at the cinema, and therefore didn't have to pay anything to see it.

This film runs like a series of sketches, which are then force fed to the viewer, rather than simply being funny in-of-themselves as part of the actual story. Whilst the cast are very funny people in other things, in this - the chemistry of main group is rushed, half- baked, and therefore unbelievable. Compare that to the dynamic of the cast in the original, and it's like comparing a picture your kid did with some great work of art. It's not even worth going into detail over, because the faults in this movie by comparison are so many and obvious, as to make all comparisons pointless and any real in depth cinematic critique an excercise in futility.

If you feel you want to see it, I would say do so by all means - but borrow it or watch it for free, do not pay for it. The makers of this film don't deserve the money and the people involved deserve no credit.

As previously stated, this is a film that simply shouldn't exist.

This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever watched and I have watched a lot of movies. The producers and directors of this movies deserve to be criticised for insulting so many people as well as women.

I tried to watch this movie with 4 family members, 2 fell asleep and 2 went, I was the only one left to watch the complete movie. The next day we just made fun of how bad it was.

This movie will in some years be known as one of those movies that are so bad it was good.

And I pray that if there will be made more remakes or sequels of movies that earlier has had a male cast but the second time around will have a female cast, that you please give them a good movie!

I give this movie 1 of 10 stars

I wanted to watch this movie, without the prejudice I had heard about, so I ignored all the negative comments and gave it the respect this franchise had built up from the original. Wow, where to start, well positively, I felt it started brightly, the haunted house theme, sat well with me, but then in came the main characters , I've never seen a film die so quickly, extremely unfunny script, acted by extremely unfunny actors!. Somebody, somewhere looked at this project and signed off at least $200 million, to make this!. Some reports state $500 million had to be made to make this film profitable , after all bills including marketing!. How they managed to get most of the original ghostbusters to have bit parts in this amazes me. It tries painfully hard to be slap stick, but in the efforts to be funny, it seems to have lost all communication with its audience. If it was meant to be a disaster movie then it achieves this, it's the only movie were I hoped the ghouls would win and kill off all the main characters !!. Just to prevent another film!. A big budget film comes with great responsibility, this one is as responsible as a one year old baby. Thisis without doubt one of the worst I have ever had to endure, to sit through to the end , to me , was a major accomplishment. What were the producers thinking!!.???

The new Ghostbusters isn't as awful as other films but it was definitely disappointing of it had zero charm, the effects were badly made to say the list and the comedy in it was poop-jokes that even the Jackass crew would find to immature.

The main reason why I didn't review it sooner was to re watch it and let my personal thoughts shank in and not be affected by the war between those who said that it is a dis-grace to the memory of the original, the persons who said that the first-ones are misogynists and the usual trouble-makers who joint either side just to cause more chaos for their amusement. So not wanting to get tangled in to that mess I took my time and this is my personal point of view.

Firstly the actresses in the film are quit good comedians when they have the proper material and here sadly it isn't the case. An other issue that I have is that almost all the male characters are total A-holes to our protagonists. OK I get to have some of them be like that ,but everyone(?) that is genuinely offensive to the other half of our specie. This when you think ,no matter the gender it is wrong to show in such as way our society.

Secondary as previous mentioned the effects aren't even on par with the 1987 film, really you had tens of millions in your disposal and this is your best? As for the jokes are seldomly good and usually I felt that were written by people who lack any idea what is comedy. As for the little horror elements are OK at times and forgettable in the rest of the flick.

Thirdly the theme song was awful. For real I have no clue why they choose that piece a garbage. It tries to be like the original ,but in the modern times. Here an idea WHY NOT use a theme which is made for you and you can use it!?!

Over all it is times like that, when you think that Hollywood has run out of originality and you get nostalgia. To be honest after reaching a little I saw that after the first film most of the main members and directorial team didn't wanted to come back so can it be a surprise that a film which was never to be made was below our expectations

This movie is just plain awful. I saw this movie very recently and I hoped it would at least be better than Dumb and Dumber 2. It wasn't. How this was possible I still don't understand. The movie was shockingly stupid. This movie was so dumb I can't even recommend it to brainless fools or children. This movie makes the Star Wars prequels look like Citizen Kane. There is only so many negative words to describe this film. First I don't blame the poor actors in this movie because all have been successful else ware but man even they were bad here. I'll chop it up to the writing. I only chuckled a couple times threw out a comedy!!! And every time it was due to Chris Hemsworths character. Please I beg you do not see this movie it's not even bad in a way where you can make fun of it. It's like if Adam Sandler wrote a movie intentionally with stupid jokes. This is Jack and Jill but as A GHostbusters reboot!!!! If you remake a classic at least do it justice and not make it horrible. This might be worst than Ghostbusters 2. All in all horrible movie that I can only recommend to people who think that Jack and Jill and The Phantom Menace are good movies.

Ghostbusters (2016) is a disgrace to the originals. Disguised as a remake the movie shows an obvious political agenda: Men are stupid. Shown by idiotic male characters and "woman power!" you are thrown into the world of empowered woman and comedic ghosts. Destroying an incredible franchise only to deliver the "women are awesome!" spiel. They become so enthralled in their own narrative they forget they're supposed to be making a Ghostbusters film. Take your political agenda else where and leave classic movies be classic movies, without your tarnish. To ruin an incredible movie for such silly reasons should have never been allowed.

$144,000,000 seems a little pricey for a unique fixer upper re boot, but overall what did I think? I think this movie should be condemned. There's serious humor fatigue from all four cast members, the writing is substandard and is completely inadequate to my nostalgic needs and the CGI is like a PS1 zone .

Ghostbusters was average. Not a great movie. Kristen Wigg, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnion didn't have good on-screen chemistry. The acting was bad. Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon were annoying. Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) looked as if she could had been the offspring of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and her character behaved like she had ADHD. Chris Hemsworth provided some good comic relief and he did have his moments. The film had some good nods and references to the original film. Some of the film was funny, but silly and some parts of the film I did find funny and did make me laugh. The film wasn't scary. Only 1 scene made me jump. The ghosts weren't scary and Slimer was badly computer animated. Ghostbusters is defiantly not one of the best films of 2016. I didn't think think it was as bad as Deadpool and Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But it's defiantly one of the worst films of 2016. It lacks the magic of the classic 1984 film and it could had been better.
