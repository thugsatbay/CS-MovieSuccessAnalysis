### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases: downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a brain as it had a heart  plus an original approach to the well-known material and great visuals. Having said that, 'Rise' practically pales in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170 million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.

The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Ceasar and his fellow simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything that happened during that time (and alas, way too much of what will happen), I'm not going to spoil anything for those who carefully avoided watching said trailers. As with all my reviews, instead of giving away any details about the story, I'll elaborate on all other aspects of the movie.

What needs to be mentioned first is what an astonishing achievement 'Dawn' is when it comes to the use of CGI. I'm normally very critical towards the (over-)use of CGI  but the level of craftsmanship displayed here simply has to be admired. It only took me seconds to forget I was watching digital characters (brought to life through the outstanding motion-capture performances by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell and Judy Grier  to name but a few), and I can't begin to imagine what a task it must have been for the artists and wizards in the animation department to work on every background and every tiny little detail of every character until this level of seamlessness and reality could be achieved.

But nearly every other aspect of the movie has been realized equally well: Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score fits and reflects the drama on screen perfectly, while the  often terrifying  beauty of the images on screen had me immediately wondering who the DoP was (now I know: Michael Seresin, the genius veteran DoP of such classics as 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'). When it comes to the action; well, 'Dawn' is not your usual summer blockbuster. This is no light-hearted, comic-book-style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top action scenes. What we have here is a gritty, realistic portrayal of a slowly escalating conflict, and when we do get to the battle scenes in the third act, those scenes are a spectacular, mesmerizing visual feast (and ultimately heart breaking).

But the core of this film  and also the reason why the action scenes in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really gets to you  is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its well-drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable actors). The tragic simian/human conflict mirrors our real  and very human  past and present day wars and social frictions in a very credible way and thus makes this film resonate far beyond what any mere Sci-Fi premise would let you expect. 

So my verdict: With its beautiful imagery, highly relevant story and breath-taking effects, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as its mass-audience orientated constrictions allowed it to be (which  in this case  is very close); an astonishing achievement and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.

I had been really looking forward to Dawn but it was a wasted opportunity in my opinion.

I liked how in the original that you felt for Caesar and the apes and their plight was a simple one in just wanting to get to the forest. Okay an origin story always offers more meat but it had me a lot more involved than Dawn which was ultimately a leadership struggle film.

I felt this film was weaker because it descended into the rather clichéd dad trying to connect with his son, 2nd in command wants to take over, they have a big bust up at the end. If the main protagonists were humans and not superbly rendered apes, I think some more might think the story a little predictable, almost like the Lion King.

It's like how I thought the first was clever for showing the monkey strengths and ingenuity in outsmarting the humans. However in this film the monkeys wouldn't actually have been any good at aiming the guns or reloading. So although cool seeing them fire guns, the humans would still have had a tactical advantage.

I'm not saying this to be a spoil sport for the action scenes but it was lazy film making that the makers didn't then think of a clever way to use the monkey strengths to get round this tactical weakness.

Fox bundled the original director out of the way for daring to want to make something of equal calibre and switched in Reeves to create an inferior sequel that hit all of the generic blockbuster marks but had no real heart. Maybe this is proof that recreating the 'lightening in a bottle' of Rise does require a little more time and effort than simply throwing money at special effects.

For me it was one step forward in the technology and CGI but two steps back in the story telling. In Rise, the effects aided the story. In Dawn, they were the story.

I wonder why this movie has such a high rating. This tricked me into going to the theater to watch it. So, a virus kills most people on earth. At the same time the apes evolve and become intelligent. Of course this has to happen over generations and not just by the passing of time in the same individuals, but let's say it happened. And so the plot holes begin:

All the human survivors are gathered in one building in the middle of San Fransisco. What are they eating? Do they grow the earth? -No

Do they raise livestock? -No.

Are they near a spring or well to have fresh running water? -No.

Are they dressed in animal skins or primitive hand made clothes? -No, they use 10 or 15 year old clothes and look great.

So all these people together produce a lot of waste, what happens to it? -Nothing, probably use the sewers which are capable of functioning forever without any maintenance of any kind. Probably the writers imagined the survivors using the toilet and flushing and the water appearing magically from taps, showers and toilets...

What do they really need? -Power to charge the i-Pad to see the old photos. Of course they cannot go to the nearest refinery or gas depot and fill a tanker truck, but they risk their lives going to the mountains against angry intelligent apes, because the radio uses a lot of power and the nuclear plant doesn't work any more. Makes perfect sense.

And of course when they repair the dam the power magically transfers to the city, tenths of miles far, because of course poles do not fall down and cables don't cut after 10 or 15 years without maintenance just like the sewers.

The apes can all talk, and the villain ape has English accent. They prefer to use sign language though because a language which is useless in the dark or even just when the other person is not looking at you is superior to a spoken language.

And which is the best way to test guns? By shooting them, because 10-15 years old or older guns with out any kind of maintenance never blow up in your face when you try to shoot them.

And then the apes learn to use the guns and they shoot literally thousands of rounds without ever reloading. No need to reload in wonderland... I, personally had one year of training for my military service, and I am still not sure how to use a weapon I was not trained with but hey I m not an ape!

A lot more stupidity from the writers and finally, the human warns the apes that the army is coming to wipe them out, but the ape leader which through the entire movie is depicted as intelligent, moderate and cautious does not order to hide in the woods. Instead he stays in the city waiting for the army.

The characters are a joke, especially the bad guys, and generally don't spend any money on this if you are over 16 years old. Don't watch it altogether if you are under 16 years old because it is full of stupid and meaningless violence...

What on EARTH are the people who have raved about this film watching? Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.

I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's "Monkey Planet" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after "escape"). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.

I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in "the real world" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in "Rise", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.

There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......

1) it is set just 10 years after "rise". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.

2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing "Ape not kill ape" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since "rise", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some "dramatic" piece of "plot" development spurs them individually on....

Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clichéd "plot" so i will limit myself to one more observation.

3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.

And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which "helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic "events" in the film.

Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie "You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell"

1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?

As an avowed fan of the original Planet of the Apes films and the 2011 reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment in the prequel series. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, but I left the cinema feeling a little underwhelmed. Of course, the motion capture effects are amazing, the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is suitably bleak (power supplies have almost been exhausted and the human populace is in panic mode) and there is action aplenty, which might very well be the problem. You see, as strange as it may seem given that the majority of characters are apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is very typical in both its characterisations and narrative structure.

Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up the story 10 years after the events of the previous film with the vast majority of the earth's population having been wiped out; either by the ALZ-113 virus or the violence that broke out as panic set in. A group of survivors have etched out an existence amongst the remnants of what was once San Francisco, but fuel supplies have been exhausted and an alternate power source must be found. Meanwhile, in the forests north of the city, the burgeoning ape population is living peacefully under the rule of Caesar (Andy Serkis), a benevolent dictator of sorts. When a group of humans led by Malcolm (Australia's Jason Clarke) head into the forest in an effort to repair a dam that could potentially generate power for the city, conflict ensues. Despite the best efforts of Caesar and Malcolm to hash out a peaceful co-existence between the two groups, ignorance and distrust abounds and the tensions escalate. There are the requisite bad guys on each side  Gary Oldman's Dreyfus for the humans and the scarred Koba (Toby Kebbell) for the apes  whose actions ultimately result in war between the two groups.

The attitudes and actions of key characters are a reflection of what has been happening around the world for as long as we can remember. Koba's experiences in captivity have left him with a bitter hatred of all humans, an attitude that reflects ways in which certain groups today (such as the Islamic community) are marginalised because of the actions of a few. Dreyfus, on the other hand is of the arrogant belief that they are "just apes" and thereby don't pose a serious threat. Again, how many times in history have we seen such situations where one group has such an overwhelming sense of superiority over another that they feel utterly justified in their desire to use force in an effort to secure what they want. Of course Caesar and Malcolm, who have developed a mutual respect and know that such conflict is completely unnecessary, are caught in the middle as war breaks out. The parallels to conflicts such as those in the Middle East are obvious and it is this distinct lack of subtlety that prevents the film from soaring as an engaging narrative. Reeves was obviously conscious of the need to appease an action-obsessed audience desperate for a fix of mayhem and chaos and such a focus prevents the film from offering any genuine insight into what is an utterly intriguing premise.

There is still much to appreciate in what has been achieved on a technical and aesthetic level. The motion capture work is brilliant and, even if there are a few moments where some of the apes don't look quite real, the creation of the forest world and the apes who inhabit it is remarkable; certainly a far cry from Roddy McDowall in costume in the first Planet of the Apes in 1968. As Caesar, Andy Serkis is fabulous and it is great to see that he is duly credited as the star of the film. The casting of Clarke as Norman is a good choice because he doesn't bring any pre-conceived audience expectations or the baggage of previous roles that might burden a higher profile actor. Whilst Clarke is quietly effective as Norman, fellow Aussie Kodi Smit-McPhee has little to do as his son Alexander, while Keri Russell's Ellie is the convenient love interest with requisite medical training. Perhaps the biggest disappointment amongst the cast is seeing a talented actor like Oldman confined yet again to a one-dimensional role as a bombastic, narrow-minded douchebag. Whilst there are elements that impress, Dawn of the Planet of Apes possesses neither the intelligence nor the heart of its predecessor.

I want to write a different kind of review for this movie because every other bad review has already said most of what is so bad about it. My two star rating is for Andy Serkis alone, who I think is a true artist with everything he does!

This review is a Spoiler from start to finish!

Massive budget - check 

A reasonably good first movie of the franchise - check 

Andy Serkis - check 

Storyline - let's talk about that point

Writers sitting in a room to put together a "great storyline" for this sequel:

We are set only 10 years after "The Rise" so...

"What are the basics we need"?

"Apes"

"Good. What else"?

"Humans."

"Sure, but maybe a few less. Let's face it, the Apes have to have a chance at fighting the humans. Say we kill off most humans on earth, leaving just hundreds left in smaller groups...but how?"

"A virus! A virus that was a result of complicated genetic...."

"Perfect! A virus! And we can say it had something to do with the Apes and so on! We need to keep it simple. Moving on. What else do we need?"

"A new nice guy...Oh, and maybe a couple of "actors" playing his family"

"What happened to James Franco? Never mind...a new nice guy then. What about more important things now like...we need a war. So, how do we give the Apes a chance against the technologically advanced humans? Should they be 'building' sophisticated weapons to challenge the humans?"

"One option would definitely be to have the humans create a massive arms depot and just have two idiots look after it. Oh, and maybe these two idiots could also just spend their time drinking and shooting for no reason. It would be easier to kill them off that way. This way the Apes would have access to lots of guns, which they know how to use, since...they are intelligent."

"Awesome...but how do we explain the arms depot. Did I miss something about zombies or others human enemies in the outline?

"Nope, just the virus. The humans aren't really aware of the Apes initially.

"Ok...arms depot it is."

"How do we get things kicking off?"

"I'd say we need a human volatile and a monkey volatile."

"Say no more...done"

"Anything else?

"Explosions"

"I agree. That's it for today. We meet again next week to discuss the next sequel. Thank you for taking time of your well deserved luxury life style!"

This is my first review of a movie. The enjoyment of writing this review made up for the 2-hour agony of watching an appallingly bad story line together with poor acting and terrible scripting. And most of all - a negligence to explain anything to the audience.

While this film was a little slow it delves into the heart of an issue that has plagued us for centuries: why do we fight each other and why do we go out of our way to kill each other. While this film involves the beginning of a war between humans and apes, this war could represent any war between two clans or factions, with the difference being ideological, cultural, or even as pathetic as the colour of one's skin. It is clear that the hostilities that arise come down to differences that are pretty much only skin deep, and that is that one side are apes and the other side is human.

As I watched this film though it made me think about the wars that are brewing, or raging, around the globe, and how many of these wars begin through misunderstandings and outright lies. Among the apes we are being told that humans are barbaric and dangerous, and that they cannot be trusted. Among the humans we are told that the apes are responsible for the virus that devastated humanity. Then there is the manipulation of facts and the propaganda that begins the war, as well as the struggle within the factions, between those who see war as being pointless, as well as those who believe that it is necessary, because those who do not go to war are weak and will end up being overthrown.

There is also the misunderstandings and the distrust between the two sides, for while they are told to discard their weapons, there is one that always has to ignore the request due to the fear that by discarding their weapons they open themselves up to being attacked and being defenceless. Of course there are those who are always looking for a peaceful solution, trying to work together, however the peaceful ones are always being undermined by the war mongers, who for some reason seem to have the loudest voices.

Sometimes I wonder whether Hollywood actually supports the warmongers in power, or whether they are closer to the left as the right claim they are. For me it is the Hollywood dichotomy in that they have aspects of both the left and the right within their culture. Obviously there is the lose morals of many of the characters, and of course the idea that seeking revenge for being wronged is actually okay (which seems to form the basis of many an action movie). In this film it is the question of war, and the fact that when it comes to war, those who cry for war, and those who manipulate the truth to fuel the passions of the masses, are those that then to come out on top, and those who advocate for peace are seen as weak, and in some cases, unpatriotic.

Humans generally have a superiority complex that makes them often consider all other forms of life as inadequate. Civilization has exemplified the mass exploitation and selfishness humans are capable of in the past, and present, on numerous occasions. The Planet of the Apes series delves on this complex. It displays the vulnerabilities of the human race and how nothing is to be underestimated.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will surely entertain. As the sequel to the last instalment, we follow Caesar in his new habitat following the human pandemic instigated by the Simian influenza. In a world where the human population is depleted and infrastructure collapsed, society is broken apart and in a fragile state. With stubborn and selfish humans, the fate of humanity does not rest in good hands. 

Watching this film, I cannot say there ever was a moment of dullness nor boredom. Though, for me, there was nothing exceptional about it. The plot is one that we have come to expect and the CGI was certainly state of the art. Putting this aside, it is the story of Caesar and the strive for freedom of all that captures this movie's true essence. Empathizing with these intelligent beings no longer being the tools of humans is one to both support and fear. It is this unique mixture of elements that make Dawn of the Planet of the Apes so touching yet stimulating.

This is a movie I'd recommend all to see since it offers a perspective many contemporary films fail to produce.

I couldn't hide my eagerness to go to cinema on the first day, because the "first Ape" is soooo good. But after 15 mins of watching, I can predict the whole story, and keep hoping my prediction would be wrong. NO! The story is old, ridiculous and easy going.

The Dawn might receive my better review if it was released 10-15 years ago. But it's 2014, please, except CGI, the rest is easy to know before you watch, overwhelmed with non-sense details and very stupid.

- Apes teach each other human's language but never use it? - Apes live next to human around 10 miles but no one knows? Even the whole world has been trying to find them for years? - The factory is workable after so many years with just a little effort of 4 guys in several hours? Come on, I live in the country where we depend on such power source, to run such kind of factory, we need a big team of engineers, workers from many departments working together on specific conditions. - We just need a stupid man and stupid apes' leader ever to start the war so easily. - ipad, cameras and many electronic devices are working well after many years without power, wow. - Human are lazy,aggressive and selfish. I think when those people living in such kind of condition (no food, no electronics...), they should kill each other before apes come. ... 

I don't want to list more and more non-sense and illogical details but how the writer can ignore so many basic thing like that? Huge disappointed about the "second ape". 

Finally, the ape leader who didn't want the war, now stays in the city to wait an army coming to kill them all. OMG...Can't be "better" ending.

After watching the 'not too bad' Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the 8.3 out of 10 rating is what made me think this film might be worth going to see at the cinema. I mean, if it was a bad film it couldn't get such a high rating, right? Well God knows who on earth is giving this such a high rating because it is a very poor film, even with my low expectations after the first film, which was mediocre (but a lot better than Dawn).

In Dawn, humans have mostly died out. Then some humans (who were apparently living in their hundreds just down the road from the apes, despite the apes claiming they haven't seen a human in over 2 years) stumble upon the apes' den in the forest. The humans want access to the dam that the apes have built their home around.

There are some good humans and some bad. There are some good apes and some bad. There is some betrayals and then war breaks out. It's all very, very, VERY predictable and we've seen it all before many, many times. There really is nothing new or interesting here. I mean, yeah OK it's an old 'one side against the other' story but Jesus man, if you want to keep the audience interested you've got to do something a little different! Every element of this film, including the subplots, have all been done before and it has taken no talent to write this story. All of the characters are bland and I really just wanted all the humans shot, good or bad, so that I wouldn't have to suffer their inane conversations.

I had to give this a 1 because it was so dull, so pointless, so unoriginal, so bland and a total waste of time.

Sequels can be a worry when coming from big studios. Greedy cash-ins are all too familiar, where rather than stepping further into the world established by the predecessor and exploring unlimited opportunities in character and themes, they just add more antagonists, more action and more noise. It can also be worrying when the original director who helped see a great film through till the end is replaced in the next film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a refreshing and involving take on an old franchise and director Rupert Wyatt set up such promise for its sequel. Matt Reeves takes over the reins here on Dawn...and thankfully has taking the film to a rare, brilliant new level.

The film is set ten years after the first film. The ALZ-113 virus has continued to evolve Apes. Led by Caesar, they have made their home in the woods and bred. On the other side of the island (and the world), humans are scarce. The virus has had the opposite effect and spread, killing billions. Those thousands we do see remaining are struggling to survive. When an unfortunate situation occurs between the two sides, war is imminent. But not all humans and Apes agree with the potentially devastating results.

Whereas Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a stripped back study of the science at the core of the story, whilst investing us in the human drama, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes throws us head first into a very different world. The scope is immense and multi-layered. At one view, it's a dead, frightening post-apocalyptic world. At another, it's brisk, dynamic and visually arresting. Matt Reeves has such a masterful handle on every string and creates brooding scope, claustrophobic tension and powerful action sequences; all amongst a basic, but incredibly rich morality play which is raw and powerfully spoken. What is most fantastic about the character approach is nothing is clear cut. Good vs. Bad meet in the middle and spirals out to both sides. I could sit here and blabber about the complete awe I had of the major step up in visual effects of the Apes, but that's not what caught my attention. Right from the opening scene of an extreme close-up of Caesars eyes, I felt the characters. The performances from all stunt men and actors bringing life to these apes transcend the visual brilliance. It is collective. It is immersive. It is terrifying. Andy Serkis delivers one of his most satisfying performances to date. His dedication and his understanding of every thread and fiber of Caesars being are in every frame of this film. And I cannot forget to mention the all-out, aggressive performance from Toby Kebbell as Koba. He breaks the barrier of something quite terrifying and strong.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transcends the Hollywood blockbuster. Not only does it deliver that rare sequel explores its world and characters further, but it's also richly told, beautifully and hauntingly portrayed and truly exciting and terrifying in equal measures. Quite possibly one of the best films of 2014.

I had enjoyed the first film in what I guess is the modern version of the PotA franchise, so I was quite looking forward to this second film. The plot jumps quite some time ahead, to find mankind surviving in small bands following the outbreak of a virus around a decade ago. Meanwhile Caesar has established a community deep in the woods, founded off the survivors of the battle on the Golden Gate bridge. When a group of men ventures into the woods looking for an old dam in the hope of getting power to their community, it tests trust and loyalty within both camps.

As the title suggests, this is the point where the Apes start to develop rather than just survive, and as such it holds a key point in the series; unfortunately this is something that the film very much feels and as a result it carries itself much more seriously than it can bear. The base elements of the plot are all well and good, with a narrative that expands on war, peace, trust, fear and aggression in a way that balances the apes and humans pretty well. The problem is not that it does this, but that it carries it all too heavily, producing a rather ponderous tone that sees the delivery imbued with too much weight, with all the characters and every line seeming to be aware of the import which it has. This robs it of flow and naturalism, both of which it could have done with.

When the action comes, it carries this same weight. It provides plenty of good moments but again there is the constant sense of importance and darkness about it  so there is nothing that really rivals the Golden Gate Bridge sequence for spectacle and tension. In terms of the technical side of things, it is hard to fault the film, and the motion-capture performances really feed back into the effects to produce more than just impressive computer generated effects. Performances from Serkis and Kebbell are both very good, and it is shame therefore that Clarke is as stiff as a board and Oldman mostly wasted with little to actually do. The rest of the cast are the same  the humans seems overly labored while the apes are generally better.

It is not a bad film by any means, and there is a lot to like about it, even if a lot of this is what it could have been rather than what it is. The weight it carries is evident, so it doesn't just deliver an epic plot, it feels that it is doing that, in every word and scene. This stifles it, making it feel ponderous and too self- aware, which is a shame because there are a couple of very good performances in here, and a lot of impressive effects work.

I am sorry, but this is one of the worst movies I have watched... ever. I normally check IMDb for good films and get them from the video store to watch. However when this got a 5 star rating from various reviewers, I decided I would actually go to the movie theater. What a waste of time. Sitting next to one of my friends, I could guess what was going to happen before it happened, literally, throughout the movie.There were multiple to name, however, but there were two that struck me as the most cliché, and forced me out of the cinema to take a toilet break (which I never do when watching a movie at the cinema). The first was when the power was turned back on and the horrible acting protagonists moved to a store which is know overrun by trees and vegetation. A guy puts on a song and I said to my friend, "If they start dancing, I'm leaving." I subsequently left. Another cliché (and extremely annoying) moment was when the main human (somehow not Gary Oldman who had about 4 minutes screen time!) had to run back to get Caeser some supplies (he'd been shot) and I guessed, "hey, Caeser's son who is the only ape against the new leader not tied up for loyalty, will meet him and ignore him". It just sucked. Sometimes people say "that was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back",well for me,that was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back!Not joking! Highly unrecommended!

I would not call myself a huge Planet of the Apes fan. The first film is a classic, the rest of the original movies are average at best, Tim Burton's film was entertaining, but it was 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes that ignited my interest in the series. The film had an excellent story to tell about how an experimental Alzheimer's drug could lead to world takeover by super-intelligent apes. It was suspenseful, exciting, and a real thrill to watch. Plus, it had some great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, and Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the Apes. Rise was one of my favorite films of the year, and when I found out a sequel would be coming out, I was understandably excited. I awaited a bigger, more action-packed movie than Rise that would hopefully give me more of what I loved about its predecessor. Now, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes showcases some quality special effects and action, but it is far too pompous, self-important, and generic for my liking.

The movie is a post-apocalyptic story told both from the human and ape point-of-view. The apes do have a somewhat interesting story; particularly a dramatic betrayal between to two ape leaders that works very well. Andy Serkis gives another great motion capture performance as Caesar and Toby Kebbell plays the scarred bonobo Koba well. The human actors manage to give the apes a good dose of emotion while remaining believably animal. Unfortunately, the human characters in this movie have nothing interesting to do, and not one of them is at all interesting as a character. The post-apocalyptic story is as generic as it gets, pitting a band of survivors against the odds in a struggle to get power to the city. It is the type of broad "post-apocalyptic" story that seems like it was lifted straight from an episode of The Walking Dead. You would think there would be more imagination and ideas for a future where apes rule the world, but there is no such thing here. It is the same band of survivors schtick we see in every cheap zombie apocalypse movie/show nowadays. Gary Oldman chews the scenery like nobody else, but he can't save the humans in this movie from feeling utterly dull and pointless.

Thankfully, the apes take center stage, and while their story is more interesting than the humans', the seriousness of the whole thing is often laughable. It is basically Hamlet in digital monkey costumes. A lot has been said about the "performances" of Serkis and Kebbell, and yes, they are able to convincingly embody the ultra- intelligent, emotional apes. It is an impressive balancing act, but whenever one of them was on screen, I couldn't help but feel like I was being presented an effect; like the actors were trying to show me how much they could act under the digital makeup.

Even with top-notch special effects and a great set of action set pieces, I was disappointed by Dawn. The film had potential to takes us to a brand new, ape-dominated world, and sometimes it does. The ape's forest city is beautiful, realistic and imaginative, but it, like all of the great elements of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is overshadowed by a painfully generic post-apocalyptic story and frustratingly pretentious tone. The tone of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is dark, which can definitely be a good thing for a movie like this, but director Matt Reeves lathers the drama and grittiness on so much that he forgets to entertain. Instead of simply taking the story seriously, the film takes itself seriously. 

That, in itself, is the problem with the movie. It thinks it is an important, world- changing drama, when in fact it is not. It's a glorified Last of Us ripoff, masquerading as a Shakespearian tragedy. The action is great, but the tone never wavers from the absolute dead serious. It's a shame because I loved the balance in tone that the Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes had. It was dark and scary, but it had real heart and the action was actually fun. Even though I enjoyed the effects and action, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is just too generic, too bland, and far too serious for me to recommend over its highly superior predecessor.

I have been a fan of Planet of the Apes since I was a kid in the 70s. I was instantly in love. I read the books of the films when I could get them (you couldn't just pick up a movie back then. There was no video available). I avidly watched the TV show and I bought merchandise. I was besotted and have remained so. Maybe this has something to do with why nothing since has quite come close.

Let's get the good stuff out of the way. The animation /CGI of the apes is phenomenal. They look real. The idea that humans had almost been annihilated by a deadly flu is a great plot device and better than the reason given in the original films (a plague killed cats and dogs so we brought apes in to replace them as pets and then to be servants). That's it. After that it's all down hill.

The story is riddled with holes and left me asking why, why, why throughout the film and long after it had ended. Forgive me but I have to get them off my chest.

This is 10 years since Rise and no humans have been seen for 2 years but there is a huge city just over the bridge. It's so close you can see it when the generator turns on the power and the lights come on. Hang on, they already had power anyway so the lights would already have been visible.

The humans come to find the dam because they only have 2 weeks power left. Hey, great forward planning people.

The man they bring who is the only person who knows about water power is a dick, such a badly drawn character but they need him. Then they dump him and get the power station working. Err how? Why do apes hunt stag? Why do they kill a bear after the way they have been treated? Don't they appreciate letting wild animals live in the wild? Why do the apes ride horses? Are these the naturally wild horses normally found in forests? Why does Caesar's son, Blue Eyes, side with Kobo the bonobo? When Kobo and his mates get the guns they have no problem in loading them and shooting them. Kobo is such a good shot he hits Caesar easily.

When Blue Eye's goes to Caesar's house they all speak to him in English. When did he learn this? Caesar plops out the odd word now and again but surely he normally talks ape talk and sign language.

After 10 years the camcorder still has battery life and works. It wasn't looted or smashed.

Gary Oldman's character has no motivation for wanting a war.

The humans have a "Tower" that strangely seems to be all scaffolding. Ideal if you're a bunch of monkeys and want a fight.

Oldman set C4 around the tower - just above his own head. Erm that might just kill you when you detonate it. It did but it didn't kill our boring human hero who was standing there at the time.

Caesar's other half, Cornelia, is very ill and needs antibiotics. She gets them and feels as right as rain by the end of the same day.

Caesar after being shot is really weak from blood loss. Never mind. Give him 2 days and he will fight like he's on meth against Kobo Bonobo.

There was more. So much more.

On top of that it's too dark and too long.

The Planet of the Apes franchise has always fascinated me but I hadn't been interested until seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes a few years back. The emotional depth that that film brought to the table was unparalleled in terms of big blockbusters. I was attached to Caesar and several of the other apes. That movie surprised everyone so it isn't much of a surprise that the sequel 'Dawn' looked even better as they hired Matt Reeves as the replacement director. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and the acting was surprisingly outstanding. The trailers looked incredible so my excitement was about as high as it could possibly be for an apes movie. And the film doesn't disappoint.

The film takes place at least 8 years after 'Rise' and the time jump is much to their benefit. It allowed Caesar to step into his role as leader of all the apes and link between the apes and humans. Speaking of the effects, some of the facial expression the apes gave were just devastating. And for me to say that I was on the verge of tears in a movie where apes can talk should sound absurd but its the truth. Caesar's family is present throughout and his eldest son is the one that hit home. When you see him being put into war unwillingly after life changing events you just cant but help feeling terrible for him. Koba, the corrupt ape who has always believed humans are more dangerous than Caesar thinks is also a conflicting character. There is a scene between him and Caesar near the first act that made me feel sympathy for him and whatever other apes were also tortured. Dreyfuss, played by Gary Oldman also stood out for the short periods that he appears. Much like Koba, he is a man who lost so much that he has lost faith in the world and wants nothing to do with the other species. It's these two characters who keep the conflict rising as peace is on the downfall and war is on the brink. The only real weak part of the film is that the trailers show a lot of the important scenes and I'm a guy who watches trailers everyday. I knew a little bit too much.

To say that Caesar is one of the greatest leaders in film history is not an overstatement. When he is on screen you cant help but be mesmerized by the immense strength and gravitas that comes along with the character. Now it is time for the academy to honor the greatness that this film brings to all aspects of filmmaking. I wouldn't go as far as saying Serkis deserves a best actor nod, but I wouldn't disagree if they gave it to him. The performance is one for the ages.

The third act is brilliant in every way a film should be. It was unexpected, visually dazzling, and emotionally fulfilling. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go. It's one of the best movies of the summer and definitely made it's mark in motion capture history.

+Caesar's unparalleled leadership 

+Special effects and motion capture are just insanely good 

+Apes facial expressions can be emotionally devastating 

+Koba & Dreyfuss similarly troubled

-I knew a bit too much from trailers

I loved the first part. It was fun. So, naturally my expectations for the second movie was high. That, and a metascore of 88 on the first day, naturally, I expected a masterpiece. But what i saw was just awful. 

The first few scenes have no dialogues, it's all sign language, with a bit of monkey sound here and there(60% of the film, actually). That puts you to sleep right away. There are no awe inspiring scenes, not one frame of amazing graphics. The "emotions", well, didn't work for me.

Story? Okay. Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get electricity, Caesar allows them to work, and asks other monkeys to help. Meanwhile, mean monkey Koba goes to Human place and sees a bunch of weapons. So, it comes back, attempts to kill Caesar and then starts a war with the humans. Climax? Meh.

Sincere advice, don't watch this. Franco and the cute little monkey, in the first part entertained me. This one put me to sleep.

While the plot is interesting enough to stay awake through, this move has so many glaring technical flaws it became simply ridiculous. The CGI while very detailed, fluid and spectacular, is also glaringly unnatural, and distracting.

The human mission is also very technically flawed. With enormous systems which would require constant supervision and maintenance are simply treated like a light switch to be flipped on and never need to revisited. Lame dialog "this relay is bad go get another one." to some kid who grew up in an apocalyptic wasteland, who would have no idea what a relay was not to mention the specific type of relay, as well as they are in a dilapidated facility with what appears to be no maintenance parts or anything else to conduct repairs with.

While I get that the apes are advanced and not to be confused with real wild apes, I can give some leniency for sci-fi. But they are apes, not aliens, I am reasonably familiar with apes and their limitations especially from what has been demonstrated in the previous movies. They overreach their technical as well as physical ability, very quickly. The basic parallels between the mentality of the humans and apes is reasonably clever and thoughtful but a bit slow and near the end down right heavy handed.

Here's the spoiler. Once the apes capture many guns from the humans the movie goes down hill fast. The apes who have no familiarity with guns other than being shot by them, are now able to fire 2 assault rifles simultaneously in each hand while on horseback in a full gallop and actually hit targets other than than themselves or the horses the're riding on?!?! The complexity of loading a magazine with the correct ammunition, then chambering, switching the safety, aiming, trigger control, loud sound tolerance, etc, is completely dismissed. This is why soldiers basic training with a rifle is 8 weeks long (granted not all 8 weeks are rifle training) and the rifle is anatomically designed to be fired by a human not an ape. But you get the point, an ape no matter how smart wouldn't be able to simply pick up a rifle and do much more with it than use it as a club.

I've seen worse for sure, but this movie is highly overrated, if you are sensitive to technical flaws like I am this movie will frustrate more than entertain.

Count me as one of the people who was completely bored with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The story makes absolutely no sense and therefore I couldn't get into it. I just thought it was meh.

1. The apes have been living out in the forest for ten years now, can still barely speak about twelve words, but they ride horses? Really? Where are the stables? How do they train the horses? What do they feed the horses when there aren't any hay fields or even fields of grass around? How did they make those fancy reins for the horses?

2. Caesar has known Malcolm for three days and trusts him and thinks of him as a friend for some reason? Why? Malcolm hasn't done anything to gain said trust. He's there for selfish reasons, to get that dam working. They don't have any meaningful conversations. Caesar can barely speak twelve words. True, they save Caesar's wife from some type of illness, but Malcolm doesn't do that, the female doctor does that. And about that. The wife is on her death bed and the doctor gives her some antibiotics and shazam she's up in less than a day? Huh?

3. The climax of this movie is basically just the ending of the Lion King with monkeys instead of lions.

4. There's just way too much CGI in this film. It's impressive at first but after a while it's just like watching a cartoon even though it is realistic. 

5. I didn't really care about anyone in this film, was given no reason to. Not enough time was spent with the apes, or with the humans, when they were doing anything but shouting and shooting guns, for me to get to know any of them. I was bored.

6. The 3D did nothing but distract me. Instead of getting absorbed into the little story that there is, I was like, wow look at how that stump looks so much closer to me than the apes are, while missing whatever was actually happening.

7. All the subtitles were just idiotic. I don't know if they were using real sign language because I don't know sign language, but it seemed to me the subtitles said a lot more than what a few hand gestures could represent. Was there some reason the apes couldn't just, you know, talk, and talk in a conversational manner instead of barking and grunting out words? Caesar has had ten years since he spoke his first words. He should be talking as well as a thirteen year old does by now.

8. There was a lot I just didn't understand. If the vast majority of the human population has been wiped out by the flu, why aren't there corpses all over the place? Why did they even let the bad guy who shot the ape at the beginning come back with them, when they knew he couldn't be trusted? Where did the camcorder with the scene from the previous film come from all of a sudden? How did they fix a gigantic dam with nothing but wrenches? How did Caesar suddenly recover from his gunshot wound at the end to go on and fight Kobo? Why did he tell Malcolm that he was "a good man" when Malcolm hadn't done anything particularly good to deserve it? And there is so much more that just didn't make sense to me.

9. Basically this is a very loud, in your face, not subtle at all film that doesn't take any time to develop characters or get you emotionally involved in anything. It's just a lot of CGI action and yelling. I thought it was boring.

Spoilers Ahead:

First, all of these Ape movies are allegories, they were never intended to be taken literally as empirical realities. Of course, the Apes home is impossibly constructed, the mastery of human weapons and tank use are absurd. What was adumbrated in Rise, with the sneeze of the contaminated lab worker, is brought to full fruition here with the Simian Flu that almost exterminates the human race. Yes, detractors, the movie is a failure as a pure adventure story. The way to appreciate the movie is to see it as it was intended to be: an allegory about two groups of creatures full of hatred and mistrust learning to overcome their differences and, through the commonalities of existence, reaching a sense of understanding for the other group. This powerful lesson is taught through Caesar's nobility where the love visited upon him by his adopted father, in Rise, gives him the strength to endure great challenges to his patience with humans. There are two parallel stories working here with each group: Caesar and Koba with Malcolm and Dreyfus. Both Koba and Dreyfus are filled with implacable hatred for the other's group; Koba's is more salient but Dreyfus shows it to you when he stumbles on the words,"Regain all that we lost." The battle at the building is as unreal as the bridge battle in Rise; yet, it is important to remember the point is to teach a lesson about learning to overcome prejudice and racism towards different peoples.

It is not a coincidence that the dyads fight simultaneously at the end; Dreyfus shares Koba's wish to exterminate the other group regardless of the costs to his own group. Caesar tries to remind Koba of this but, Koba in an ascending tone of rage replies, pointing to his torture scars,"human work, Human work, HUMAN WORK." His hatred is mirrored in Dreyfus, this is the key to the story. My favorite scene is where Malcolm hugs Caesar, restoring his faith in humanity. This scene is the entire movie in a microcosm. The movie begins with the near fatal first meeting where Caesar stops a massacre. The director throws in historical allusions like the famous Reichstag Fire that Hitler blamed on the Jews and used to persecute them mercilessly. Here, Koba shoots Caesar and starts the fire he blames on the humans. What hurt this movie, severely, is that many people approached it as a straight forward action movie. Be warned, it is an allegory like Rise, here the theme is two groups of creatures learning to stop hating and killing each other. Yes, detractors, it contains some bad scenes that were not the best choices. I could have lived without the gas station with the 60's awful music. 

Admittedly, the cast, with the exception of Oldman, is much weaker than Rise. There are greater breaks with reality (using automatic weapons, tanks, conquering humans); always remember that, like the bridge battle in Rise, these are necessary to make the allegorical points of the narrative. Serkis does well conveying Caesar's nobility, it is not all one sided. Caesar's naiveté about Apes not ever reaching humans level of violence is disproved by Koba. He clings to it as he released Koba, to his death,"Koba not Ape." The core of the allegory is spoken by Caesar to Koba when the latter tries to cloak his genocide with Apes' survival. Caesar responds,"Koba fights for Koba." When you watch it notice how this is mirrored with Dreyfus. It was a nice touch to have the humans return Caesar to his childhood and protect / care for him. This rankled the empiricists who decried the improbability, but again, this is not a realistic movie. Caesar's faith is restored and he returns to defeat Koba. The embrace of Malcolm and Caesar with their look at each other was the entire point of this misunderstood treasure. Yes, detractors, this is a step down from Rise but its message of overcoming fear and prejudice for others different from ourselves, coupled with Caesar's nobility, is why I own this movie. I invite you to revisit it as I found myself doing; it took many showings until I could articulate why I loved the movie.

I think I just watched an Old Testament epic from the 1950s - so earnest and plodding with high ideals and dull dialogue.

The only interesting character in the film was Coba, when he acted the fool in the armory. The rest were just family-values people trying to be good. The lead actor was dull, and why was Oldman cast as a military commander with his squeaky voice - it actually broke like a teenager's when he was giving commands.

So much of it was predictable, and you just knew it was going to end with a punch up. Almost gave up half way through.

I really don't want to say much more. Totally inferior to Rise and a great disappointment.

There are some films you go to see with low expectations and back in 2011 Rupert Wyatt's "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" was one of those. After the Charlton Heston classic, a long series of increasingly poor sequels and a failed Tim Burton reboot, apprehension was high. But how wrong could I be. This was 100% a 10/10 film (if I'd been doing these reviews in those days): an epic and gripping story; great performances from James Franco, John Lithgow, Freida Pinto and Harry Potter star Tom Felton; and stunningly executed special effects, with Andy Serkis's performance delivering amazing depth of feeling and emotion. (The scene where Serkis's character Caesar first speaks is one of my top 10 "most goose-bumpy" moments in cinema history).

Now, 4 years later, we have the sequel - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - which, given how much I loved the original film, I approached with a similar feeling of apprehension. But, I am delighted to say, I was pleasantly surprised.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes neatly takes over in its opening titles where the closing titles of the first film left off. The so-called Simean flu has wiped out 499 of every 500 people on earth, deftly explaining why James Franco and Freida Pinto fail to reprise their roles in the sequel: in fact it would have been an unrealistic cop-out if either had done. Instead - monkey business aside - we have a brand new human cast led by Jason Clarke ("Zero Dark Thirty", "The Great Gatsby"), Keri Russell ("MI-3's" 'bomb in the head' girl) and heavy hitter Gary Oldman. These characters are trying to rebuild a new society for the survivors in San Francisco, but their desire for power (of the volts and amps variety) puts them in direct conflict with the emerging simian society deep in the redwoods. Much conflict ensues, not only between the two tribes but between the factions of the two societies.

Once again, there is a good story by original writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, joined by Mark Bomback: underneath the set-piece action sequences, the majority of the drama comes from the relationships between the characters, and especially that between Caesar (Serkis) and his estranged son played extremely well by Nick Thurston, culminating in a remarkable stand-out scene between the two in Caesar's old home that is genuinely moving. And another specific callout was Yorkshire-born Toby Kebbell playing the emotionally and mentally wounded Koba: his scenes in the human armoury - think Heath Ledger's Joker crossed with PG Tips advert - are both funny and distubing in equal measure.

Is it as good as "Rise"? No, not in my view. The first film was novel and deep, and "Dawn" is more superficial in comparison. It is also far more of an action film (or "a bit fighty" as my dear wife described it), with some standout battle scenes that are a masterpiece of special effects. If "Rise" could be compared to the original "Alien", "Dawn" is much more like "Aliens" - wham, bang, thank-you Simian.

The director this time is wunderkind Matt Reeves ("Cloverfield", "Let Me In"), directing with panache and a narrative drive that only occasionally lets up for emotional punch. The acting is good and (as flagged above) the special effects are outstanding: the production team clearly saw "I am Legend" and wanted to go one better with the San Francisco streets. And all topped off with a fine and un-obtrusive score by Michael Giacchino.

Highly recommended, and I am now looking forward to the next sequel, planned for a 2016 release.

I love Christopher Nolan, He has simply changed the way superhuman,extraordinary thrillers are made. Now everyone is just following him. Most of the Directors are trying to show the dark and more realistic environment in the movies and MATT REEVES succeeded in it.

It is a extremely well-made and enacted movie. What works is the intensity of the characters. Caesar is the character taken straight out of the last installment, Rise of the Planet of the apes. He is the brains and the brass together. The movie is entertaining and includes a surprising ending.

The film has got some amazing graphics. The Apes look real and in every way you sympathize with them. I would rate it 9 out of 10 just for graphics,acting and the intensity of the film.

The themes of human extinction and doomsday have been done to death in Hollywood. We have had alien attacks in Independence Day, asteroid collisions in Armageddon, machines taking over the world in The Terminator, The Matrix and The Transformers, global climatic catastrophes in The Day after Tomorrow and 2012, and pandemics leading to the wipe-out of the human race in I am Legend and Resident Evil. But these panic inducing themes have always managed to garner an audience thanks to the overwhelming special effects showing destruction, edge-of- the-seat action, and the sheer daredevilry of the characters involved. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes lends a new perspective to this theme. While it shows the perennial undying human spirit for survival and their utter disregard for any other living species in the pursuit of it, it tries to zoom in closer on the conscientious aspect of the human mind. The intellectually advanced apes have also been portrayed in the same light as their human counterparts. Although the transition from the last installation is not entirely seamless, the script is far more rational compared to 2001's Planet of the Apes which had a sophisticated and highly evolved ape colony enslaving humans. This one has a start similar to I am Legend wherein the human race has been eliminated due to a simian flu triggered by a scientifically developed virus. As expected, a handful of American survivors immune to the virus colonize a small area of San Fransico trying to make the most out of the limited resources available to them. Concurrently, they attempt to establish contact with any potential survivors elsewhere. Gary Oldman plays Dreyfus, a former military man who leads the settlement. Soon they are close to running out of their power backups and the solution to this problem lies in the forest across the Golden Gate Bridge where Caesar and his extended family of apes have built a protectorate of their own. The latter part of the story then revolves around the negotiation and conflict between the ape colony and the group of humans who are trying to bring back the old power source to life. This group of humans is lead by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Ellie (Keri Russell) though Keri Russell's role comes forth only as a filler for a female lead. Instead of sensationalizing the plot, director Matt Reeves manages to keep it grounded by delving deeper into the humane aspect of the face-off. At the risk of making it look preachy, he tries to show how a future struggle of survival might be more about introspection rather than brawn. Caesar played by Andy Serkis continues to address the whole situation with a rationality which is completely unexpected of an ape no matter how evolved it is. While he has to put up with the rebellious Kobo, Malcolm has a rotten apple of his own to deal with. The movie is successful in driving home its message of the co-existence of good and bad elements in civilization where the good needs to continue to pursue its cause irrespective of the action of the bad (I can only wonder what George R. R. Martin would have thought about that). And it does this without compromising on the entertainment quotient. Andy Serkis does justice to Caesar's character yet again just as he did to Gollum and King Kong. The movie ends with an implicit hint at a sequel but that can only be confirmed by the franchise.

An intelligent blockbuster. This may sound like an oxymoron. But the idea that big budget blockbusters have to be purely visceral experiences with little to offer in terms of cerebral and emotionally intelligent content has been encouraged by the kind of films that have been successful at the box office of late. The financial success of films like the Transformers franchise seem to indicate that audiences have developed a palette for mindless action and crave for more films of such type. The studios have no qualms providing more of the same. So, it is pleasantly surprising to say the least when a studio decides to spend a decent amount of money to make a film that is as smart and engrossing as the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise. What filmmaker Matt Reeves has accomplished with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is nothing short of spectacular. He has created a stellar motion picture, which is very elegant in its handling of difficult themes and complicated emotions that one might not expect from of this nature. The story has a dramatic arc that is positively Shakespearean in its handling of the primary characters and the screenplay is literate enough to provide even the smaller characters with moments that help us understand what they bring to this world. The script allows the audience to understand the motivations of all characters and makes it difficult to establish the dichotomy of good and bad/right and wrong. So assured is the filmmaker that he does not shy away from making several ambitious allegories about race relations, historical incidents and social psychology. Not once does any of this backfire. The resultant is a powerful and engaging motion picture experience With the messy and moody origin story out of the way 'Dawn' has more room to explore the conflicts that lie at the heart of this franchise. 'Rise', while a good film had several issues relating to the science fiction aspect of the overall story arc of the apes franchise. But, it laid the foundation for what happens in this film. Being liberated from the constraints of explaining how the world in which story transpires came into being the script is able to breathe and as a result the characters here seem more rounded here than they did in 'Rise'. It is not a great secret that this newly rebooted franchise intends to slowly lead up to the events of the original 'Planet of the Apes' film from 1968 so the eventual outcome is never really in question. But, the wonderful treatment of the material and Reeves' superb direction in particular make the journey to that point seem so evocative and poignant. On the acting front, motion capture expert Andy Serkis is definitely the one who walks away with top honours. The man responsible for bringing memorable characters like Gollum and King Kong to life breathes into Caesar a magnificent complexity and emotional heft that is breathtaking. Caesar is the heart of the film and Serkis makes it impossible look away every time he is on screen. Matching him beat for beat, is Toby Kebbel's terrifying and intense portrayal of the embittered Koba. It's hard not to understand the character's point of view primarily because of Kebbel's rendition of it. Among the human characters Jason Clarke's Malcolm is a definitely step up from James Franco's Will from 'Rise'. There is enough dramatic weight in the actor's portrayal to give the character an emotional weight that provides a fascinating human counterpart for Caesar. Gary Oldman's Dreyfus is an underdeveloped character who has very little screen time and it would appear that the versatile actor was only offered the role to make the character appear a little meatier than it is on the page. The Apes in this film are a stunning amalgam of art and technology. Not for a moment do they appear as if they are creations of a computer. Their movements, their facial expressions are rendered with such flawless execution that it is amazing to watch. The motion capture technology employed here has been developed by WETA digital and they have really pushed the envelope here with their fine work. This film represents a unique achievement in filmmaking in the sense that it is in this writer's opinion the perfect chimera of modern digital cinema and old fashioned drama heavy story telling. 'Dawn' is at times a dark and unrelenting motion picture; there is very little comedy here to provide padding to the serious content of the story. It makes the story tighter and lets the filmmaker make a film that's to true to his vision and not pander to any section of the audience to make the film more accessible.
