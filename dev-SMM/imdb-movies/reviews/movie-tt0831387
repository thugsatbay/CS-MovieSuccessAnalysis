### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This film has no plot. I wouldn't have an issue with this if instead they had filled most of the two hours with scenes of Godzilla destroying things and killing people. However, the monster himself receives a pathetic amount of screen time, only appearing halfway through the film after the plot has already focused its attention on two giant bugs. They are unimaginatively designed, have no basis in Japanese mythology like the titular monster, and their only purpose seems to be to diminish the impressiveness of Godzilla. The character development in this film is non-existent. Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood cliché. Unlike the viewers, the film believes its characters are fascinating enough to merit the laughably corny near-death and family- reunion scenes towards the end. Instead, the audience is left laughing in bemusement at the overly sincere expressions on the protagonist's face as he threatens a giant monster with a handgun. Whenever Godzilla and the insects finally begin to fight, before anything happens there's an instant cut to yet another tedious shot of US soldiers shouting about nothing in particular. The film's sole purpose is to showcase the might of America's armed forces and ability to survive under a crisis; and it doesn't even do that well, given that the navy can't even tell when Godzilla is swimming directly under their ships. Of course, setting the story in Godzilla's homeland of Japan would not interest American viewers, so the monster decides to swim across the Pacific Ocean in order to wreak havoc. No doubt Godzilla will receive acclaim from morons due to its high-tech but utterly unimaginative animation techniques. However, this film's cutting-edge CGI does not justify its lack of plot, excitement and meaningful characters.

So, I should start by saying, I went to this move not expecting a lot. My husband wanted to see it, however, so off we go.. Dear Lord, I think I'm going to find the sappiest chic flick available (even if its torturous for me to sit through) just to get payback for him making me sit through 2 hours of this crap. At least the popcorn was good!!

I liked Godzilla himself.. But, I think out of the entire 123 minutes, you see him only 20 minutes, maybe? And most of that is just watching his spiky back in the water as he swims. The rest of this movie is watching the main actor, who, in my opinion, has about as much acting depth as Kristen Stewart, look like a total tool. The shining grace, I thought, was that this movie had Ken Watanabe in it. I like Watanabe but even he looked like he was suffering from a bad case of the Taco Bell revenge and couldn't find a bathroom for the entire movie.

I spent the majority of this movie picking out dumb stuff that just amounts to bad writing. Example: Okay, the two bad monsters (which, in my opinion resemble a cross between those white strider things that the muppets ride in "The Dark Crystal" with a bit of "Aliens" thrown in to make them somewhat scary?) have the ability of creating EMPs, killing all electronics and causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.. We learn this early on in the movie, probably in the first 30 minutes. Think the military learns their lesson?? Nope, lets continuously throw about 600 billion dollars worth of F-35s and Battleships in the mix just so we can have it continuously plummet into the water. Another example: They know these muppet hybrids like to eat Radioactive materials and I guess can smell it. And hey, there's one making its way from Vegas to San Fransisco. So lets strap a huge bomb on a train and slowly move it from Vegas to San Fransisco along the same exact path that the critter is going. What kinda harm could that cause? Its not like the thing would smell it on the train and come after it, right? And why is it, the military storms into a radioactive storage facility but has no clue that an entire half of mountain has just been blasted out by muppet hybrid #2 (who's much bigger than #1) and this 30 story tall critter is somehow making its way towards Vegas completely undetected? 

And while we're on the subject of the bomb, what the heck is up with the "breeding" of the two muppet hybrids anyway?? You got a male, you got a female (complete with some glowy bulging egg sac thing that they give us a really good closeup of.. They meet up to reproduce.. which involves the male giving the female the long, phallic shaped, radioactive bomb which she then rubs between her legs all over this glowy egg sac.. WtF?? How the heck did these things breed before mankind started making huge phallic shaped missiles anyway? 

Oh..Did I mention the acting was bad?? I don't recall liking ANY of the characters, with exception to the dad (played by Bryan Cranston) and he dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are characters that seem to have no purpose whatsoever besides trying to find a way to fill a 2 hour movie with irrelevant fluff. Lil Asian boy on the elevated train in Hawaii? Didn't see any point to him.. The main characters wife and little boy?? Added nothing to the story to be honest. (And what military wife who knows her husband is in danger isn't waiting by the phone for news? Nope, phones ringing and she's doing whatever.. Or tells her co-worker she's unavailable?) The acting had no depth to it, everyone came off very flat and honestly, unlikable. There's no emotion whatsoever. Hey, a couple of muppet hybrids are destroying our city, oh well. A huge Godzilla is barreling towards our aircraft carrier? Don't panic.. lets stand at the guardrail and watch it peacefully because any emotion such as fear would be too much to ask.

Pretty sad when the most exciting thing about this movie is a bird hitting the bus window.. Although, to be honest, the CGI on the actual fight between Godzilla and the muppet hybrids was nice, the whole 5 minutes it lasted. Then, Godzilla jumps in the water and the credits roll. Best part of the whole movie.. Compared to the other 121 minutes of this movie, the credits are the best 2 minutes overall.

Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the '98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami's Spiderman series.

Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as "District 9" and the Korean film "The Host," this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.

Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I've ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that's your thing.

Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston's role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else's performance was similarly forgettable.

Honestly, I'm a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I've also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. All told, depending on which camp you fall under, this will be an entirely different movie for you. As Godzilla movies go, I'd give it a B. As darker, more serious monster movies go, I'd give it a D+.

For fans of monster movies, "Godzilla" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.

The plot in "Godzilla" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film's titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film's focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.

Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise. 

Overall, "Godzilla" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie. I just didn't care how things would turn out.

This is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. A torture. I could barely stay still on my sit. I almost left the room 1 hour before the end. But I stayed, hoping for something good to happen. But something good never happened and the ending is even worst that my worst expectations.

The trailer was such a lie. I was expecting something dark, mysterious and brainy. Something like The Dark Knight. Instead it's only military crap, dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism. Makes me sick. The movie dies with Bryan Cranston. The only problem is that his part doesn't last half an hour.

Godzilla wasn't an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. It was just sh*t.

First I need to tell that I am from Central Europe. I am not writing reviews but I can't be silent. This was terrible. This was 1st time when after movie everybody was talking how bad it was. And everybody I mean whole cinema.

First 20-30 minutes were watchable. It was looking to be a solid movie, but after that everything goes wrong. And I mean everything... Bad dialog's; good music in very bad moments and several styles of it; main character immortal; American happy ending style; no logic in this movie anywhere; many mistakes noticeable for everyone...

If a Uwe Boll have more money, he will make this movie better. When I was watching Sharknado, I was less shocked by stupidity like in this movie. It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you want to punish yourself.

Where do I begin? Nothing in this movie works. The 3D effects are the worst I've ever seen. In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen. It's almost as if the director pre-rendered the movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000... 

There are lots of other monster scenes where some minor object (broken window pane, windshield wiper, train passenger, etc.) gets in the way in a botched attempt to create depth. It never works - the monsters always seem fake and flat.

Nothing about the plot makes any sense. We're to believe the monsters could completely obliterate a nuclear power plant without being noticed. Then, when they re-appear after 15 years (couldn't they have waited a few more years like the cicadas?), they can effortlessly elude radar tracking, satellite imagery, and a hundred million iPhones and just sneak around, silently munching on nuclear submarines. We're also to believe that nobody is really sure whether Godzilla is friend or foe, so the U.S. Navy will arbitrarily alternate between sailing right next to him and shooting at him with rockets. 

With all of the nuclear power plants in the country, which are like catnip to these suckers, somehow a major plot element involves luring the monsters away from population centers with a single nuclear weapon on a train.

The score is so loud, intrusive, and overly dramatic it's mind-numbing.

The M.U.T.O.s (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are as generic and uninspired as you could possibly imagine. Just think of every mantis-shaped bug you've ever seen in any movie, and that's them. Throughout the entire movie I was distracted trying to remember where I'd seen them before - and I just remembered, they're a rip-off from Starship Troopers.

Every time a monster fight scene starts, it ends abruptly before anything interesting happens. In this movie, Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco supposedly get destroyed, but you can't really tell and won't really care. I think maybe 60 seconds was spent on the destruction of Honolulu and about 30 seconds on Las Vegas.

The guy from Kick-Ass (I can't be bothered to look up his name) plays a giant walking cliché. So do half of the Olsen Twins. So do two - count 'em two - precocious endangered kids.

The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of the dumbest I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure that bridge wasn't designed to hold a bunch of M1 tanks and - even if it was - they probably wouldn't be in a traffic jam with busloads of kids. I still can't figure out whether the bus driver was supposed to be a hero or a maniac for trying to mow down every pedestrian/soldier/policeman on the bridge just to save the walking cliché's son. And all those ships in the bay! Toy ships dropped in a bathtub would have a more organized formation.

It doesn't really matter that Godzilla isn't in the movie that much. You'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter that Bryan Cranston dies early on in the movie - you'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter whether Admiral David Strathairn gets his SitReps from the TV news instead of looking out his window at the 600-foot-tall monster. You'll just want the movie to be over.

It doesn't even matter that military people repeatedly "pronounce out" A.S.A.P. even though in real life they'd probably just say "AY-sap". You'll just want the movie to be over A.S.A.F.P.

I think what bothers me the most is the overuse of helicopters. I mean, I love helicopters. Blue Thunder is one of my favorite movies and Airwolf was my favorite TV show. I don't watch Westerns because there aren't enough helicopters in them. But the excessive use of helicopters in this movie made even me want to scream "Enough with the helicopters, we get it, you can make them look 3D! Too bad you couldn't do that with the giant monsters!"

Honestly, this latest installment of Godzilla is just as unwatchable as the Emmerich brothers' fiasco, and even Godzilla 1985 was more interesting.

To those positive reviewers who claim that it's not fair to compare this to Pacific Rim because they're different kinds of movies, I say: You are correct. Pacific Rim is an enjoyable, well done monster movie with good effects, and Godzilla is the exact opposite.

Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses  of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the  movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main  characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole  community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance   boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago  but would it  be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite  a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art  CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer? 
As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this  latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for  lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director  ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration  for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human)  hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's  masterpiece (they're both called Brody). Edwards made it very clear  that he wanted to take an "old school" approach  and as far as the  beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is  concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is  tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are  solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the  apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to  decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs  running in the streets). 
The "muto" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature  is  otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the  movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action  increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting  inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and  although there is one great creature scene after another, and although  those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards  the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side  of the story. After the first act (when there was actually still some  real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no  interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let  alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to  one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the  finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you  admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's  hard to feel thrilled. Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since  you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached. 
Ultimately  despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale   'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in  'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help  create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom  the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. Trying to  show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way  seventies cinema did  you also need the kind of character-driven  scenes where someone says: "We're gonna need a bigger boat!"

Being a fan who used to go to the movie theater in the 1960's to watch all those great (and cheesy) Godzilla movies. This new Godzilla movie is the Godzilla movie I have been waiting my whole life for. Not that 1998 SonyZilla that was so disappointing. But this movie, I know that all the long time fan's like myself will watch it over on over again. I will go back to the movies next week to see it again. Can't wait for the Blu- ray. I honestly do not see what all the haters of this movie are thinking. It's a Monster movie. Plain and simple. For 2 hours I was entertained. I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things. But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Any REAL FAN of GODZILLA will enjoy this movie and THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO MAKE IT. I cannot wait to see it again. LONG LIVE GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS!

I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.

The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others  all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on  a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.

On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience  so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed  it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness  something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.

Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value.

If Jaws was released today, everyone would complain how it took too long for the shark to turn up. WHAT HAPPENED TO ATTENTION SPANS?!

When I saw it in the cinema people couldn't even get through the opening credits without being on their phones. These are the same type of people who complain about how the human characters are dull (Yet the 1998 Godzilla characters were too ridiculous) but tell you off for saying the same thing about Pacific Rim, saying "But I just want to see action"

The people who complain about there being too little action also complain about how Transformers has too much action. The people who complain about Cranston not being in it enough complain about movies using popular actors just to get people to watch it. The people who complain about it being dark and realistic complain about the Marvel movies being too light and unrealistic.

The people who complain about this movie are whiny, hypocritical and missed one of the most beautifully choreographed movies, with the most impressive visuals even when the monsters weren't on screen, a great soundtrack that inspired terror and a cast that although lacking in the third act, made up for a great introduction and middle (Cranston and Watanabe) and some of the most epic-scaled action I have seen in the last 10 years. Cloverfield was a shaky mess that wasted the monster and Pacific Rim had sporadic fights that gave no real sense of scale.

I can't wait for the many sequels that will most likely have a lot more Godzilla now they are confident (given the box office)to use more CGI and money. He will be fighting some of the most iconic villains from the Godzilla universe, and hopefully all the idiots who watched and hated this movie won't watch it and me all the people who cheered through the first one will get to watch it in peace.

This is the first time I've seen a movie and felt cheated  genuinely cheated and lied to! The reason is because 90% of the trailers depicted Godzilla as a threat, something to fear, the city levelling monster we all know and love. The trailers were very good at misleading me to think that it was Godzilla that made all that mess in the woods, tearing that train in half, causing that fire ball at the airport  but none of this was to be! It turns out that Godzilla is a boy scout who protects us innocent little humans when the, apparently very incompetent, Navy boys are busy miss firing their highest grade weapons at a bridge full of school buses.

At least we get to see Cranston do his thing though! A favourite actor of mine and almost everyone else in the world!  One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie! The great Brian Cranston vs. Godzilla! He will be so good in this film! He's amazing "it wasn't a typhoon!" oh I'm getting Goosebumps! ... *10 minutes later* ... Nuts!!! Whatever! I could deal with that, but another major flaw is Godzilla's origin story in his own (First) movie  it's taken care of by a couple of pictures and some real smart person telling us that he's been around all this time, sleeping in the drink! Now this only feels like a slap in the face to the fans when you realise how much time and effort was put into the origins of the big, evil, baby having insect. The whole first half of the film is dedicated to the 'bad guy' alone!  Why did the filmmakers think we'd care that much?? I guess I could also deal with that too  it's a Godzilla movie; surely we'll be treated with some awesome action scenes between the two/three monsters throughout!  right?? Wrong! The first fight, for whatever reason, cuts away before we see anything good and all we get is a glimpse on a telly  The second fight? The same gosh darn thing happens! Just as Godzilla stands up in the city with his best 'come at me, bro' pose and just as you finally sit up and think "finally! Something good is going to happen!"  it cuts away to something far less exciting!  *rolls eyes* And I guess I could maybe deal with that too  I could deal with all that stuff and forgive the movie if it had an outstanding climax! You know, something worthy of the "King of Monsters"  but this was not to be  I found myself glaring at a dark blank screen that was supposed to be the climactic battle having no idea what I was looking at  half why through the "fight" I finally realised something that broke my heart  this was a bad movie. A bad movie I'd been looking forward to since the first teaser.

The film ended. I had a quick power cry during the credits  and my brother and I left the cinema wearing our black ties due to the death of our childlike hopes 'n' dreams we had while walking into the screen 2 hours beforehand.

See it if you must! By which I mean someone puts a gun to your head, walks you to the cinema, buys the tickets and sits next to you the entire time with his pistol pressed firmly against your temple.

Otherwise, save your moneys and time.

Peace.

I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old "Godzilla vs....." movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10

I meant to stay home to do laundry and clip my toe nails. Compared to this movie, that would have been a click-my-heels day filled with delight and wonder. And, I would've been 10 bucks richer. After watching this disappointing, would-be flick, i had to go to confession and ask for forgiveness for being, yet again, a gullible, wasteful consumer. I said two hail Mary's and watched Pacific Rim.

Where to begin..Godzilla 98 gets a bad rap...for what? Many of those reviews amounted to pretentious, unsubstantiated horse Shiite. That movie towers over this one like a KaiJu crapping on the naive, hapless rabble that see this movie.

Do not be taken in by the shills who are paid to fill these pages with paid, pseudo-positive reviews. The financiers, Et Al, of this multi-million dollar mess have a band of callused-fingered monkeys hard at work trying to convince you to throw away your hard-earned dollars on this remake.

I was concerned this would be a snooze fest from the get-go. Suspicion confirmed when the director kills off his only other main asset, besides the g-man, within the first 15 Min's. i e, Bryan Cranston. Way to go. I would've blamed the writers for that genius decision but the director controls the story -and, the lifespan of the actors.

Pop Quiz : What's worse than a b-movie starring a guy in a giant lizard suit? Answer : A $160 million dollar flick starring a cgi-guy in a lizard suit.

What gives? A director with cutting-edge technology and a Jillian dollars at his disposal thinks it's about time we get a cgi equivalent of a man in rubber monster costume. And, to add insult to injury, they made him look like an everest-sized couch potato. Yet, another example of how the makers of Godzilla '98 got it right. They gave us a mean, lean intelligent monster. Now, that was a movie designed to entertain. That freak was like the ultimate-fighting Godzilla, running circles around the brainless American military. 

This godzilla, apparently, was awakend from a beer-drinking, donut-eating binge due to an A-bomb that woke him up and made him look for a job. Namely, clocking two low-tech tarantulas with an over-stimulated pituitary gland. They probably woke him up from his nap so he decided to have at it with them and do a quick beer-run while he was up.

They could've named this flick, "The Monster Beer Gut that Belched on Las Vegas".

This movie had very little action. What-the-EF? This is not suppose to be a hallmark channel movie. It's a friggin' monster movie!! Hello! The key word in that sentence? Monster! Where was he? They got the g-man hiding out for the majority of the movie! And, when they finally decide to grace us with his presence it's only for a few minutes. Mind-boggling. I recommend you watch Pacific Rim and Godzilla '98 for some solid monster entertainment.

Don't even ask me about the transparent plot. Wait. Did i say plot? I meant filler material. We've all seen this many times before. Predictable story line, executed by over-used or under-used performers. Take your pick. Hero has a beef with parent/child/love-interest. Then, comes around after it's too late, only to save the day. Ever watch an adult flick with a 90 min build up to a 10 second money shot. Bingo. Only I'm still waiting for the payoff.

A person can take just so much of a hand-wringing scientist or a whimpering, clingy wife etc. If you've seen the trailer you've seen too much. This flick belongs on the Saturday morning line-up for 4-year-olds. It's that dull.

Tip of the Day : Go to the theater. Watch a nice, enjoyable movie. Then, during a bathroom break, sneak over to catch the last few minutes of Godzilla. That way, you've seen the whole movie, you've only wasted 5 Min's of your life -and, it's free.

Worse film ever! save your money and don't go. Godzilla is only in the film for a maximum of 10 minutes, the rest of the 90 minutes or so, that I lost of my life, is filled with mediocre acting that was about as exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on. I got the impression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and actors, leaving the effects for Godzilla until last, which resulted in him having minimal time in the film. Literally, up until the 70 minute mark, you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back. When a headshot finally materialised, it was only for a matter of seconds. I genuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone planning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD.

Critics have lost their way. They have rated this film average/below average because they dislike the tease of Godzilla in the movie and say an improvement would be having him centre stage every scene he's in. When you look back to some of the greatest, most tense horror/sci-fi films like Jaws or Alien, you will see that they don't always show the creature from the start, but little snippets, building tension throughout the movie. They call this a B-movie because they enter the screening with the mindset that its cheesy because they don't understand the meaning behind Gojira itself, making it sound like just another monster movie when it's not. The fans are speaking out, showing their appreciation for the movie and love for the view Gareth is giving Godzilla, but the critics do not. Never listen to them; their opinions don't stand for the millions that actually GET what the director was trying to establish here.

Also, if you're a monster movie type of person, go see this. If you're not, don't go see it. It is that simple. Don't go judging on how bad an actor is in a film when you can't even memorize a single line. Don't go writing a review that is completely biased just because you do not know the concept and origin of Godzilla. Half of these reviews are trolls anyway so it is best to ignore them (and including me if I sound ignorant). If you like monsters or Godzilla, go see it and make up your mind. If you don't, then spend your money on something else.

To all the turds here that think they know what a Godzilla movie should be, and to all the so called 'critics' that couldn't enjoy a movie if they played the star role, this movie isn't supposed to be a Schindler's List or Godfather, and if it had been it WOULD have been garbage. Too bad you couldn't enjoy it because for anyone that grew up actually watching Godzilla like I DID, this movie is nothing but pure greatness and just enjoyable to experience. I'm not going to sit there and nit pick a freakin Godzilla movie for AAA acting and story lines even though I thought both were just fine here. Anyone who has to do that with a Godzilla movie shouldn't be watching ANY Godzilla movies because you have no idea how to appreciate it for what it is and ALWAYS has been.

All I know is this. I haven't been this excited for a movie since Jurassic Park in 1993. When I went to see Jurassic Park everyone in the audience was cheering and standing up to clap for the great parts in that movie. It was exhilarating. I was 18 at that time and felt like I was ten. I had so much fun watching it. This was exactly the same. I'm sitting there, 39 years old and felt like I was ten again. There were great and memorable parts in the movie, and this all adds up to what is called a good movie. Everyone stood up at the great parts and clapped, people were wahooooing, Godzilla couldn't have been more badass looking and animated, and I've watched it multiple times at home again, still yelling and probably waking up my neighbors at the good parts. If that isn't a sign of a good movie I don't know what is, and anyone who is a true Godzilla fan would have noticed some great homages to the original movies.

Another gripe I'll address is the fact that he didn't show up till halfway through the movie, and wasn't stomping throughout the 2 hours. This is what made the movie special, and this is what made Godzilla so special in his role. If they had shown him throughout, people would have been desensitized quickly by his presence, and the movie would have just ended up another CGI fest with no soul. Not to mention some of the old movies were the same way. People would have been ready for the movie to be over with by the end of it, but as it happened, everyone was cheering at the very end wanting more Godzilla, and that's exactly how it should have been. They couldn't have done it any better. And for the people that think it was cheezy for him to ride off into the ocean in the end, GO WATCH A GODZILLA MOVIE and learn a few things. For anyone who is a true fan and grew up with these movies, get the movie and watch it if you haven't already. It's Godzilla at his best.

This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.

Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.

The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.

The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.

Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.

Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.

Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.

I am a big fan of this type of film, monsters fighting, big action sequences but wow did this film disappoint. I always take these movies for what there are and in the end they have to be fun if nothing else. Pacific Rim is a great example of how these films should be made, we know the acting and story is going to be weightless but action and comedy make it fun to watch.

Godzilla has taken the very popular of recent trend of being dark or "gritty" as people like to call it but that really struggles to work in a a film that is fundamentally about a giant lizard. The story line is one of the worse ever conceived with no explanation of any of the random things going on. Where have the MUTO's come from and what is there actual purpose? Does Godzilla just sit at the bottom of the ocean until humanity is at threat?

Bryan Cranston is a great actor no doubt and for his very brief stint in the film he does his best to add some suspense. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who i like in Kick Ass) is a cardboard actor who isn't really given the script be anything else. Some of the lines in this film feel like a 3 year old has been let loose with a pencil.

The action (or lack of) is average. The fights between the monsters were not well choreographed, they were too slow and the camera was to far out. Godzilla is on screen for about 8 minutes of total and only 2 of them are him fighting. Hes more like the Michelin man that a sleek moving monster. He moves like an action figure with its joints glued. Maybe it would have been better for him to die at the end at least that way there can be no sequel!! 

Lots of reviewers gave this film 8-10 stars and i'm starting to believe we may not have watched the same film, I went to see this film on those reviews and wanted to bring some balance. 

On another note....the trailer for this film is completely misleading, Hollywood needs to take a long hard look at itself.

Conclusion:

Bad acting, worse story and serious lack of action or fun. Avoid like the plague although if i had the choice between the two id flip a coin!!

Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!

As I was reading through the other reviews I noticed one thing. People have split (mostly) into two camps. In one camp you can find those that utterly hate the movie, and in the other one you find those that adore it. Weird enough, there were very little that were in between the two camps.

Let's talk about why people hated this movie. From what I have read those that hated the movie, hated it because:

1. Because Godzilla was not center stage. "ugh incredible, I have to wait to see Godzilla? Gawd what a draagggg.. like in Pacific Rim I didn't have to put up with this, I want my money back!!". 2. And because of the way he was designed. "Ugh, that design omg... they put no effort in creating him".

I for one have to say that I love the fact that Godzilla is not in every-freaking-frame of the movie. The first half of the movie you barely see him and in the second part you have glimpse of him and later on entire scenes with our beloved lizard kicking ass and taking names.

And I really love that! They managed to build up the suspense, making Godzilla look very mysterious and making you say "oh look, there he is!" and then poof, he disappears after a building. I had the feeling that I was witnessing those events, like I was right there. This kind of filming should be done more often, I find it a really smart and a more spectacular way of shooting a movie. 

Of course, when you compare this way of filming with Pacific Rim (because everybody compare the two) you'd naturally say that yes, Pacific Rim has and advantage over Godzilla. 

But in all honesty you cannot compare the two because from my perspective, Pacific Rim is an upfront, here is everything we have to offer kind of movie. It is really generic, you are not surprised by anything. But if you look at Godzilla, oh my... you really have all of the suspense and intrigue that keeps you hooked and makes you want more and more! I think that this movie would have not been as good if Godzilla would have been non-stop from start to finish. It's really refreshing to see a movie like this rather than the generic-action movies like Pacific Rim, Transformers etc. that give you everything on a silver platter and a lot of the times make you say *pfft, boring*.

*Being mean* I think that the people that hate having to wait in order to see Godzilla, are those types of people that have no patience, they are those people that need action, lots of explosions, effects and mindless fighting and a bad script. You have transformers and lots of other such types of movies. If you have half of a brain you would understand this movie.

And concerning the design of Godzilla I think it's great. It looks a lot like the classic lizard but with a couple of tweaks here and there. 

I myself was a big fan of the 1998 Godzilla (hey, don't judge... I was 7 years old back then, I didn't know better) and because I hadn't seen any of the old and classic versions of this monster (except from what I saw on cartoon network)I had to compare the 2014 with the 1998 lizard. But I love love love the new version.

Everything about this new Godzilla is great! From design, script and shooting, everything in my opinion is an improvement to an otherwise bland way of making movies like we have nowadays.

So try to have some critical thinking and don't judge this movie because you don't have everything thrown at you from the get-go. Sometimes a little bit of mystery is good and in my opinion they were just building the suspense for the sequel where we will probably have more prim-time lizard action.

Looking forward to seeing the sequel!!!

I wasn't sure if I should have gone to see this movie, but then my friends asked me to go and see it with them, so I did. After seeing the movie I thought that paying for seeing this movie was a mistake. I have generally somewhat liked movies like Godzilla, but this one was a bitter disappointment for me. I can't point out a single reason for why I disliked the movie, because there were many things that made the movie unenjoyable. To begin with, I think that the story and plot felt unfinished and unwieldy, with no surprises at all. Another sin for the movie were the paper-thin and indifferent characters, who stayed irksomely distant for the whole two-hour length of the film. In fact, the characters felt so distant and glued-on-top, that I could have watched the entire film without seeing any of them. Finally, the last straw was the way too long and unsurprising ending battle. All in all, this movie was sadly not worth watching in my opinion.

In my opinion, this movie was insane. Godzilla was not really that much in the movie, but when he was he kicked ass!

I don't understand people bitching about the movie wasn't like pacific rim. I liked Pacific rim, but i think it was a good idea to make something different. This monsterfilm is much more realistic, and is much, much better made (CGI). In my opinion Godzilla was way better than Pacific rim.

Bryan Cranston appears in the trailer like he is the main character but he dies in the beginning of the movie, which i think is really misleading. He's son takes the spot, and must travel from Japan to U.S.A to get his family away from the danger. The son (Ford Brody) is a very boring character because we don't see him so much and he doesn't seem very sensitive.

In the end Godzilla actually saved mankind and just go in to the ocean and swim away, which i think was a really unpredictable ending.

So don't watch this movie if you just want some meaningless monsterfight. Watch it because you wanna se a "realistic" movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat - With monsters in it.

And this was the best CGI i have ever seen in a movie.

(Godzilla has atomic breath)

Well, where do I start. I went to this movie without to much hope, but after seeing the trailer and having seen pacific rim I had the feeling that it had potential to be good. Well, it wasn't. The trailer make it out to be this mystical and realistic movie. Basically the trailer contains every scene worth watching, the rest of the movie is just visual "lorem ipsum". Let's not forget how it totally make Bryan Cranston out to be a leading role in the movie. Instead he has about 20 minutes of screen time. 

The first beginning of the movie was actually pretty good, but after Bryan Cranston's death the movie turns into a rolling train-wreck. The total lack of plot, character development, realism and good acting doesn't make it anymore interesting. The rest of the characters are so uninteresting that I mostly wanted them to die so I would have a reason to care about them. The worst is possibly the immortal main character, who seem to keep one single facial expression through the entire movie. It doesn't help that his facial expression looks like a mix between Kristen Stewart and Jaden Smith. The absent of realism and focus on any other country isn't helping either. Pacific Rim did that right, it included a lot of nations. It appealed to the audience outside of the states. But in this movie Godzilla doesn't even show his face in Japan. 

The movie continuous on with different sets of flaws to the very end. You sit there hoping for some sort of redeeming quality that you can take with you when the movie ends, but there just isn't any. The worst part of the movie must have been in the end where the main character has this "standoff" with the female Muto, it was so stupid and unnecessary that it made me cringe. Even my friend who invited me to see this film fell asleep. If they just had invested time into the story and characters this movie could have been really good. Instead they barely give the good actors like Brayan Cranston and Ken Watanabe any playtime and spends more time focusing on this dull main character than Godzilla himself.

When news got out that we would get a 2014 version of godzilla I was stoked, the trailers looked fantastic and I may have let my excitement get the better of me by raising my expectations.

This movie is not bad but it is not great, the story revolves around such a bland character stuck in a basic disaster movie plot of "I have to find my family" blah blah blah you can pretty much guess the rest. This story is dragged on the entire movie and when the big fights between godzilla and the MUTOs are teased.. we get a cut back to the uninteresting story of the bland soldier and his blander wife. The main actors do an alright job with the characters given to them but we see little of the support characters who would be much more interesting.

The big fight at the end is pretty awesome but we see very little of it as again it cuts to the human side, godzilla rather than being the lesser of two evils is turned into just a typical good guy (or monster I don't know) with no reason at all which kind of ruins it.

Over all the movie is pretty mediocre, the cgi is pretty amazing but scenes mostly just consist of dark shadows in smoke. Supporting characters steal the show but we see little of them, the main story is so boring and cliché at times the main fight becomes trying to stay awake rather than godzilla and mutos. I hate to say it but this movie is a let down, badly paced and dull but with one great godzilla fight at the end that is over far too soon.
