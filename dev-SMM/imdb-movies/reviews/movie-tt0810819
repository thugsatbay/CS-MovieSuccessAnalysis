### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
The story could have been very dramatic and deeply touching, as it is a true story of both the internal conflicts of a man and the deep love of a woman to her partner. Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un- engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I couldn't stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too superficial.

The new cinema year has got off to a robust start with the new movie from Tom Hooper ("The King's Speech", "Les Misérables"). 

We have seen many depictions of physical torture on the screen over the years, from the interminable teen-slasher pics, through 'that chair scene' in "Casino Royale" to the stylized presentations of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese in films like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Casino". "The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.

Based on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.

Eddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. 

Far more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. 

Also turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.

Another star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.

Another Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.

While the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars  so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)

I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole movie even more involving.

I don't think the film is perfect - but the acting, cinematography, the screenplay are absolutely amazing. I especially loved the middle part - where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.

I thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in Venice).

Eddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the best for 2016!

Tom Hooper's 'The Danish Girl' is a brave story, about brave people, in a time where their bravery must've been counted as mental illness. Hooper chooses the correct actors to portray the parts & directs the film with dignity. However, The Writing doesn't always engage & is flawed in places.

'The Danish Girl' is A fictitious love story inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer.

'The Danish Girl' salutes the courageous lives of Lili Elbe & Gerda Wegener. Both of whom who died too early, had the courage to be themselves, especially Lilli, who chose to express rather than being repressed. And Gerda, a women who had to face the reality, was a women who respected her husband's truth. That was True Romance!

But, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as tightly Written it should have been. Lucinda Coxon's Screenplay, which is based on the 2000 novel of the same name by David Ebershoff, is powerful, but in doses. The first-hour works wonders, but the second-hour slows down & the flaws in the Writing show up. The final-act, to put it bluntly, isn't half as emotionally moving as it deserved to be. In short, the Writing lets 'The Danish Girl' down, at some parts.

Tom Hooper's Direction is dignified. He has handled some of the most dramatic scenes, with great conviction. Danny Cohen's Cinematography is nicely done. Melanie Ann Oliver's Editing is perfectly sized. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Alexandre Desplat's Score is enchanting. A Special Mention for the nearly done Make-Up.

Performance-Wise: Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe & Alicia Vikander as Gerda Wegener, deliver brilliant performances. Eddie, fresh from his Oscar-Win this year, strikes back with a yet another winning performance, thats both, brave & heartbreaking. Vikander is splendid as his wife, who conveys her pain, with concern & sensitivity. And the on-screen chemistry between the two, is wonderful. Ben Whishaw & Amber Heard are terrific in supporting roles.

On the whole, 'The Danish Girl' isn't as good as one expects it to be, but its well-directed & very well-acted nonetheless!

Set in Copenhagen in the mid-1920s, this film tells the story of the first person to undergo gender reassignment surgery, a story which does not, sadly, have a happy ending. Einar Wegener, a Danish painter, has been married to a fellow-artist, Gerda for six years. Gradually he becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming a woman, a quest which leads him to submit to untried medical procedures which eventually prove fatal.

It does not take much imagination to appreciate how challenging it must be to find oneself stuck in the 'wrong' body and impelled to rectify this situation by resort to surgery. Perils loom on all sides - the physical risks, the psychological anguish, the threats to personal relationships, the fear of social ostracism or worse - and smooth passage seems improbable. How much more so given the state of medical and psychological knowledge in the 1920s and a less liberal moral climate than prevails today. Surely such a prospect must make for rich and vibrant drama. Yet, despite its dramatic potential, the Wegeners' story is given such a flat treatment by Tom Hooper that the movie verges on boring at times.

A bleak note is struck from the start and continued with little respite. The mood is cold and gloomy, emphasised by the colourless, sparely-furnished interiors (light-grey walls in their apartment, harsh white wall tiles in the clinics and consulting rooms - only when Gerda visits Paris do we see some gorgeous period interiors), the bare wintry landscapes of Copenhagen, and the minor-key music. The tempo is one-paced and the dialogue is often stilted and dreary. Can this really be someone engaged in a momentous struggle with their identity and, consequently, with their personal relationships and their position in society? Indeed, when Einar first steps out into the world as Lili, she seems barely noticed by those around her despite looking far from convincing as a female.

Einar and Gerda never explore with each other in any sustained way what is happening to him and its implications for their relationship. Partly because of this we get little understanding of Einar's self-perception, little sense of his insights into his condition. Similarly, we don't encounter the desperation of someone in crisis except very late on when Einar is battling with the immediate after-effects of his operations. Mercifully, we are spared visual details of his exposure to the surgeon's scalpel.

The lead characters are surprisingly one-dimensional and seem to be narrowly self-obsessed. The emotional range is equally constrained for while we witness neediness, longing and lust, there is no real passion, no sense of warm affection or love between Gerda and her husband. Nor do we see real anger displayed, despite there being much for the characters to be angry about. Lili's quest for transformation seems to bring no one any lasting pleasure.

The exaggerated and awkward manner that Eddie Redmayne brought to the character of Stephen Hawking, and which worked brilliantly there, does not really do so here. Instead it proves a distraction. Lili repeatedly responds to male attention with little more than shy downward glances and simpering expressions which become rather embarrassing to watch. Perhaps only a more accomplished actor than Redmayne could carry off this highly demanding role successfully. Alicia Vikander does much better as Gerda but cannot shine so brightly in Redmayne's shadow.

There is clearly plenty of talent associated with this film and the story of the Wegeners seems worth telling. But this movie fails to hit the mark.

This film melted me like the touch of silk. Although I wasn't fully convinced of the transformation of Einar Wegener, I am deeply touched by the Eddie Redmayne's fragile beauty as a women(or should I say Lily). He comprehends Einar's psychological conditions perfectly, and every twist of his facial muscles or movements of his eyes demonstrate the perfect empathy he has for his role. I don't care about logical consistency of plots or the point of view as long as he is the center of images, he flawlessly convinces me that Einar sincerely believe that he is born to be a woman. And as long as his feelings are as burning and heart-felt as reflected in my eyes, there's nothing to criticize about whether his decisions are morally right or wrong.

It's spirit-shattering that Einar died in the arms of Gerda, and Gerda did an extraordinary job in supporting her husband. I would give Alicia Vikander a full score too, her performance reconstruct perfectly a open-minded female artist that has unconditional love for her husband. She forsook the obscure love she had for Hans, the right to be protected and caressed as a wife, and everything women think they rightfully deserves from their husbands. Einar said before he died: "How would I ever deserve such love?"Seeing him pale like a vampire, watching his hand sliding from her hand, it's hard to imagine the heartbreak Gerda had. Would she blame herself for not forcing Einar to the doctors instead of "indulging his hallucinations?" Would she blame herself for letting her husband wear her silk pajamas and ballet dress for her own artistic career? Would she miss the man that looks to her eyes in the morning and whisper to her:"My life, my wife."? I drained my tears for her anyway. Gerda is such a wonderful woman.

I also feel obliged to comment on the institutionalization at that time. The idiot psychiatrist can't even figure out the difference between schizophrenia and a healthy man. One of the psychiatrist even proposed a lobotomy, and at the wrong spot. Lobotomy is supposed to sever the connection between frontal lobe and the rest of the brain to treat those who get major depression or anxiety disorder and don't react to medical treatment, the technique it is abandoned in the modern world for its inhumane side effects. Stupidity of the doctor reflects their ossified believes about trans gender people and their lack of professional knowledge, which explains how hard it was for Einar to defend his faith and for Gerda to stick to the belief that her husband was not insane.

Except for the fascinating acting skills, I really really really adore the lighting and color of the film. I can proudly hang every frame of the movie on my bedroom wall(except the scene Einar showed his male parts, maybe), and proclaim them art pieces. Harmony of colors and subjects, like oil painting, is the best solution for a film that is filled by sentimental transformations. Or it would easily fall into the trap of melodramatic depiction or confusion of emotions. But better than A Girl With a Pearl Earring, this film is consolidated by subtle facial expressions of actors and actresses, which clearly present the inner struggles of characters.

For conclusion, I love this films and the techniques are perfect. But I find it difficult to agree with Einar. He burdened Hans, Gerda, pained them emotionally, and even caused his own death, because he wanted to have a female body? Is it the ability to have sex as a woman that's more important, or is it his and his loved ones' welfare that comes in priority? Let's leave it to everyone's own judgment.

"He's comfortable in his own skin," is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. "The Danish Girl" (R, 2:00) is one such story.

Inspired by the true story of early 20th century married Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, like David Ebershoff's 2000 book on which it's based, "The Danish Girl" is a fictionalized account of Einar's physical transition to Lili Elbe. Neither the book nor Lucinda Coxon's screenplay makes any claim to absolute historical accuracy. This story changes many of the facts for dramatic purposes. The real-life situation of Lili and Gerda's life was much more complicated than we see on screen. The result is a film that tells a simple story in a way that elicits empathy for the protagonists and enlightens the audience.

Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander, his wife, Gerda. The couple lives in a large apartment in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both make a living painting. At first, Einar's landscapes are more in demand and more respected than Gerda's portraits. One day when Gerda was in a hurry to finish a portrait of their mutual friend and ballerina, Oola (Amber Heard), Gerda asks Einar to stand in as a model by putting on Oola's stockings and heels and holding up Oola's dress in front of him. Although the scene is played with a combination of humor and awkwardness, it's obvious that Einar likes the clothes. He starts trying on his wife's clothes which gives birth to an idea. Gerda is a bit conflicted, but being the open-minded person she is, she suggests that her husband dress up as a woman to attend an art world function that he had been trying to avoid. And just like that, Lili is born.

The thing is that Einar had always felt like a female and being Lili was the first opportunity that he had really had to express what he felt was his true gender. Einar wears women's clothes and make-up more and more often, both at home and out in public. Lili even begins secretly seeing a local man named Henrik (Ben Whishaw). Gerda is understandably upset by all this, but she never criticizes her husband's inner turmoil or its outward manifestations. She wants to understand, and the more she does, the more she mourns her marriage, which she sees as slipping away. However, as all this is happening, her art career begins to take off. She paints Lili more and more, in fashionable clothes and in little or no clothes. As Gerda's style develops, increasing demand for her paintings soon leads the couple to move to Paris.

In Paris, Lili blossoms as a person, even as she seeks a more permanent solution to her feeling that her biology doesn't match her identity. She sees doctors whose diagnoses are wide-ranging, but are mainly focused on Einar/Lili having some sort of mental deficiency. Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenarts), a childhood friend of Einar, tries to help, but he can do little more than offer moral support to the couple. Finally, Lili and Gerda find a possible solution in the person of German doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). Dr. Warnekros offers to perform practically unprecedented sex reassignment surgery on Lili.

"The Danish Girl" is a very sensitive portrayal of a very tumultuous experience in the lives of two real people. Whether you sympathize with the situation of the two main characters or not, you're likely to empathize with them as people. While presenting a story about the controversial topic of gender identity, Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper also tells a very human story within the framework of the movie's plot. At its core, this is a tale of love and loss, of tolerance and devotion, of feeling comfortable in one's own skin. Although some Movie Fans may find some of the situations, images and the brief but graphic nudity (both female and male) to be disturbing, and the plot does drag at times, one of the main reasons to see this movie is for the award-worthy performances by the two leads. With impressive emotional range and depth, both Redmayne and Vikander make this story surprisingly rich and relatable. Hooper draws even more focus (literally) to the characters' feelings by choosing especially significant moments to bring his camera in very close for a tight focus on the characters' faces, while allowing everything beyond their necks to go out of focus. "The Danish Girl" deserves credit for its honesty, its emotional power and its succinct presentation of a very complicated story. However, some of the changes in the story seem designed to increase the impact of the story, a move I would call emotionally manipulative. For that and other reasons, I just wish that this otherwise excellent film had been more historically accurate. "B"

I wanted to write a review of this movie, slamming its pretentiousness and hurling tons of allegory onto its maximum levels of Oscar-Bait that the trailer for this movie strained really hard to get across with all of its criteria: the contemporary message of love for the trans community, the good actors, the period-drama setting, the operatic score. Instead, however, I come to tell of a movie that is so emotionally lacking, so frustratingly distant, and so boring, which is in a way the biggest disappointment for me.

To start off, the film's production design is strong. There was some over-saturation of the colours they use to show this unrealistically colourful world the character's live in, but the costumes are all interesting and engaging. The mis-en-scene and the editing, however, are a mess; Tom Hooper definitely shoots the environment better than his actors, as whenever a conversation is going on, he continually isolates each character to their own separate take and a camera that focuses in on actors with nothing to react to. This, combined with a continual lack of proper establishing shot, is a terrible choice of how to do the movie; I know he's trying to make them intimate to us, but he fails at making them intimate to each other and, as a result, the audience doesn't care. The editing's a confusing and weird one; there are a much of moments that make no sense. Firstly is a scene where Einar delivers laundry to a woman collecting it, but he does it with such insane speed it makes Usian Bolt look fat and slow (he has to run from one end of their big house to another, after having to tie the bag up tight) and it was so weird you wonder why they included it. Same with the scene where Gerda gets out of a full period costume, including big knee high leather boots, and into another one in the time it takes her husband to paint a smudge on his canvas. But by far the biggest "why the hell" with the editing is a shot when he's first becoming Lili, and it cuts to some water on the floor. There was literally no point except to confuse the audience.

Now onto the biggest issues with this movie - Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander and the script. To start with Alicia, she's great. She honestly is, with both her body of work and her performance in this film as she tries to bring a complete range of colours and shades to this performance as she laughs, smiles, cries, and dances around. The problem is she's trying her damned hardest to add something to nothing. And let's get one thing straight here, this movie treats Gerda Wegener like dirt. She's not a successful artist, she only has a career/notice because of Einar before and after the creation of Lili, and she never, NEVER gets angry, to the point where its insulting as he selfishly pulls himself away from her and into Lili, leaving her absolutely alone. Except for one scene where she pleads with him - "I need my husband. I want to hold my husband", which is said out of frustration than anything else - she never speaks out on any of it, and when she does, he says one sentence then immediately shuts up. It's like the fantasy of what people hope for other people to be, rather than them actually being it - that scene where she first finds him wearing her nightgown and then immediately starts banging him is so insultingly, unrealistically forgiving that it hurt me. Mr Redmayne now. First of all, whilst I thought that he did do a good job in The Theory of Everything, I did think the Oscar was more appropriate in the hands of Michael Keaton or Jake Gyllenhaal. In this movie, I have the exact same issue as I did with that movie; he only tries with the difficult stuff i.e. the actually being a woman, or actually having Motor Neurone Disease, but the other times he is just a flat page delivering things awkwardly and not really acting. The problem with this is that his Stephen Hawking got ALS in the first 20 minutes of that film and he could really do his thing, but in this, he becomes a woman in the last 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes are wonderful, but it doesn't warrant an Oscar - or any award to be honest. He's a coy, fluttering, meek person who doesn't really change personally throughout the film beyond the physical nature of it. The script is full of lines that are over-shadowing the theme of the story, but not in a good way; lines like "It was like I was kissing myself" or "I'm worried you'll look at that picture so long you'll disappear into it" are cringy and not clever.

Apart from one scene in a Prostitute peep show, where Einar ends up mimicking the woman's movements as she observes and goes from weirded out to curious to understanding to sorry, the whole film grated for me badly. It's boring, distant and while it was just under 2 hours, I thought I'd been there longer

You want to go see it, be my guest. But if this wins an Oscar - especially for Best Actor, which something of this calibre doesn't warrant - then I hit the floor.

Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.

The Danish Girl (2015)

*** (out of 4) 

The semi true-story of painters Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), a married couple who find their lives changing when Einar dresses as a woman so Gerda can have someone to paint but it brings something out in him. Soon Einar is going around as the Lili character and soon decides that he's a woman on the inside.

THE DANISH GIRL is another beautiful looking film from Tom Hooper, the director best known for his Oscar-winner THE KING'S SPEECH. Like that film the director has no problem with the visual look of the film and Hooper certainly knows how to put you in the period setting. It also doesn't hurt that we've got some excellent performances and a rather interesting and conflicted love story.

I think the real draw here are the performances with Redmayne once again delivering a remarkable piece of work just a year after his Oscar win for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. A lot of actors have played male/female characters to perfection. In my mind the greatest was Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE but that there was a comedy whereas this here certainly isn't. It was really remarkable seeing how well Redmayne played both the male and female character and he was certainly believable as both. Whenever the Lili character was on screen you really did feel as if you were watching an actress and not just a man playing a female. Vikander is also excellent as the woman who finds the man she love slowly turning into someone else.

The film features some beautiful cinematography, a great music score and I also thought the screenplay was very good. The story itself drags a tad bit during the first portion but I think it asks a lot of really good questions about what love is and of course what one feels about who they really are. I thought the flow of the film was quite good and there's no question that it nails the costume design and sets. THE DANISH GIRL isn't a masterpiece but it's certainly a very good movie with some excellent performances.

"The Danish Girl" is a beautiful package that came with plenty of anticipation. It is the story of a pioneer, an opportunity to showcase the talents of two talented performers, and had it been in the hands of a more capable team, it would have reached heights that very special films are able to attain.

There's nothing wrong with the performances of the leads. In fact, Redmayne might be even better than in his Oscar winning turn last year. Vikander continues to show she's an acting powerhouse. Her range is incredible, and she handles the drama and complexity of her role the way more experienced actors could. She and Redmayne work very well together, and it's a pity that even with all the other members of the team, the director has managed to give us a film that is even more frustrating than "The King's Speech". That film benefited from Firth and Carter's chemistry. This time, the themes are darker and more controversial, but they have been stiffled by the way an otherwise gorgeous score is constantly blaring and drowning the emotional life of the performances. Scene after scene we are "cued" to feel wonder, pity, sympathy, or whatever emotion the musical score is supposed to signal. It's a pity because if the music had not been there, the film would be very powerful.

Yet,it's not the only problem. The script seems scattered. Had it followed a more streamlined and straightforward path, it would have been better appreciated. Instead, the production relies too much on the gorgeous photography, the exquisite outfits, the sensitivity of the class these people belong to. Are they bohemians? Are they artists? Are they really talented? They are supposed to be free-spirits, but they certainly struggle with the different possibilities they encounter.

Redmayne conveys the torture and confusion nature has presented him with. He knows what he feels. Hopper makes sure we see him caressing the fine fabrics, but he remains sensitive and rarely achieves femininity the way those three actors were able to project in the farce "Wong Foo". Redmayne is way too classy. Still, his eyes can show pain, fear, and anxiety, and that certainly helps the film. One asset and a problem is his mate. She's powerful, expressive, can deliver lines with certainty and emotions. She shows loyalty, affection, love, lust, and confusion and matches Redmayne in just about every frame. Vikander steals the show.

There's much that is important here, and its power is lessened by the lack of confidence on the subject matter, and because we are constantly distracted by the aesthetics, forgetting what really matters is the bond, the souls, the hearts...

I missed the rawness of dialogue like McLaine's in "Terms". Life is not exquisite, is flawed, is full of pain and that makes the special moments precious. This is a showcase for performers of all types, but there is hardly any unity. It's that isolated masterpiece in the museum that we are supposed to admire, but we can hardly gather any true liking for it.

Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I don't consider this a must see.

The Danish Girl is a movie loosely based on the life of Danish artists, Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe(Eddie Redmayne) & Gerda Wegener(Alicia Vikander). Einar & Gerda are a happily married couple. Einar is the more accomplished artist, between the two of them. Gerda paints portraits & Einar paints landscapes. Gerda is frustrated because her portraits don't get sold, quite as often as she would like them to. One day, she makes Einar dress up like a woman. Gerda does this because, she wants to paint a portrait of Einar as a woman. Gerda & Einar come up with the name Lili Elbe, for Einar's alter ego. Gerda's Lili portraits are a huge success. What Gerda did not expect is, Einar feels extremely drawn to Lili & sinks more & more into Lili's personality as the days go by. 

The Danish Girl is a fantastic film! The love shared between Gerda & Einar has been depicted beautifully, by director Tom Hooper. It is gut wrenching to see Gerda slowly lose her husband, as Einar soon realizes that Lili Elbe is, who he was always meant to be. Apart from the flawless & poignant story, this film has showcased exotic locales. Copenhagen & Paris, where the majority of the movie takes place, have been showcased beautifully. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Alicia Vikander is spectacular as Gerda Wegener. Vikander's multifaceted portrayal of her character, is the best part of the film. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe. Redmayne emulates the gait & mannerisms of a woman, to the T. Redmayne gives another memorable performance after The Theory of Everything(2014). However, Alicia Vikander outshines Eddie Redmayne, in every way possible. She carries the emotional weight of the film, on her shoulders. Amber Heard is impressive as Ulla. Ben Whishaw is great as Henrik. Matthias Schoenaerts is superb as Hans Axgil. Sebastian Koch is awesome as Warnekros. The supporting cast is good too. The Danish Girl is a must watch. It's an inspiration to transgender people, all over the world.

The timing for a movie like The Danish Girl could not be more perfect. Here is the true story of Einar Wegener, the celebrated Danish artist who became the first recorded case of sex reassignment surgery in history coming out right as publicity about Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner, and the critically acclaimed show "Transparent" are pushing all those worn out water cooler jokes right into the trash cans of history. The movie is a loving tribute not only to Wegener's courage in trying to find his own sexual identity during a time when such a thing could easily lead to mental institution, but also to the love and devotion of his wife Gerta who stood by him during his journey of self discovery.

And yet . . . the movie left me cold.

For all its emotional outpouring, mainly from a wonderful performance by Eddie Remayne as Wegener, The Danish Girl never quite hits the high points that I was waiting for. There's an undercurrent of expression that seems buried and never hits its emotional peak. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't engaging. It is a very involving story, and very well acted, but something feels restrained.

We meet Wegener at the height of his fame in the 1920s, married to the fellow painter Gerta Gottlieb (Alicia Vikander) whose work was no less brilliant but far less successful. Einar and Gerta's marriage is loving and lovingly active. Yet, for Einar, there is some piece missing, something in his soul is stirring to get out and as the movie opens those feelings emerge one day when Gerta, short for a deadline, asks him to put on a dress to pose for her painting. That's when the dam breaks and all the things that Einar has been struggling with finally bubble to the surface.

It becomes clear that what Einar has been feeling is not so much passionate affection for his wife (which he has) but a need to be near her, and a need to be who she is. When he touches her underwear it isn't because it's sexy, but because he longs to be qualified to be in it. When he stares at women at a party, it isn't out of lust, but out of envy. Gerta is, much to our surprise, very open to this. She's willing to embrace her man's budding orientation even if it is likely to make them social outcasts. She starts painting portraits of "Lili" but doesn't tell anyone that it's her husband. They even take Lili (to which he eventually changes his name) out in public where no one ever suspects that it is really Einar.

This, naturally, does not bode well with society at large. Early in the film a doctor gets Einar to open up about his sexuality and almost immediately prescribes shock treatment, reminding us that this was a time when doctors could essentially play God, prescribing dangerous "corrective measures" or simply locking a person away with no trial, examination or good reason. Clinically, this was to be his fate until, later, he met an enterprising (and far more open minded) doctor who suggested that Einar be part of his experiments in sex reassignment. That comes at the very end of the movie and is difficult to watch when you know that it eventually claimed his life.

What works best are the performances by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander who lovingly recreate what must have been the most challenging relationship that any married couple might have had. She's accepting of her husband wearing lingerie under his suits and seems even a bit turned on. She sees it as kind of a kinky dress-up. The two start stepping out on the town together, not as husband and wife but as two girls on the town. For Gerta, this is a step that she finds that she must be forced to face, that Lili is becoming her husband's dominant personality. Naturally, she feels the weight of how odd this situation is.

The film allows us into the tight, closed-in spaces that Wegener seemed to occupy, symbolizing the confinement that he must have felt in real life. Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything gives us a performance that is achingly sad. He's a very expressive actor who always seems on the edge of bursting at the seams. And yet, like his performance as Hawking, he does wonderful work in a movie that I can't fall in love with. The film is too remote, too distance, too unwilling to engage us. The pieces are there, the story is well told but the emotional notes seem to be missing.

My other problem with the film is that while it celebrates Wegener's personal struggle it comes up very light on displaying his work. Wegener painted beautiful watercolors mostly of women and one suspects that they were all pried from personal expression. Yet, the work seems only fleeting in the movie, and I think that's a major misstep, if an artist's work in an expression of his soul then why don't we see him doing more of it? We see it, but we don't feel the passion that he poured into it. Gerta is actually the one who does more of the painting in the movie and it is never expressed why she wasn't more successful.

The Danish Girl is a movie that I struggled with. There are two beautiful performances here but I couldn't get to the emotions that I was supposed to feel. We never get to the middle of Wegener's true struggle with society at large. Yes, he's given shock treatments. Yes, he's beaten up by street thugs. But there's an element of danger missing from the film, something that I was supposed to feel but did not. This is a good and human film with greatness that is never allowed to come out.

In 1926, in Copenhagen, the successful landscape painter Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is happily married with the portrait painter Gerda (Alicia Vikander) and they have been trying to have a baby for six years. When the model Ulla (Amber Heard) does not come to their apartment, Gerda asks Einar to pose as a woman for her to proceed her work and Einar uses the alias Lili Elbe. There is a party and Gerda convinces Einar to pose of Lili to play a prank in the guests. However, Einar leaves his identity behind and unleashes the personality of Lili. He lives in a constant dilemma until the day he meets Dr. Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch) that offers a dangerous surgery to change his sex. What will Einar do?

"The Danish Girl" is a film with the story of a woman trapped in a man 's body and one of the first surgeries to change the sex. The theme may be attractive for a few people, but the cinematography is magnificent and the performances are top-notch. My vote is six.

A non-biographical biopic, "The Danish Girl" is one of the worst attempts at mainstreaming an LGBT-themed story I have ever had the displeasure to see. It takes far too many liberties with the real lives of its principal characters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and reduces an interesting story and relationship to a superficial tear-jerker, albeit an excellently photographed one.

As in the book, Gerda Wegener's sexual identity is completely neglected, and Lili Elbe's transition is initially portrayed less than identity awakening and rather than role-play. Redmayne as Elbe is thoroughly miscast - it's really, really time by now to have trans parts played by trans people. He plays the character like an effeminate gay man, and if you have trans friends, you will understand how untrue that is. Vikander is doing OK with an underwritten role which shies away from the less romantic real story - for instance, Wegener was not present when Elbe died. Whishaw's character is completely superfluous. Sebastian Koch owes his presence to a big German contribution to the film's budget - still, the most interesting part of the story, the reassignment procedure he is carrying out, is dismissed by a sloppy, predictable script.

As some of you may know, there was an LGBT campaign to get "Tangerine" nominated for an Academy Award. That film is low budget, features actual Trans actresses and (almost) avoids cliché. If it wasn't for that fact, I would probably rate "The Danish Girl" a 4. But since it was actually nominated, it amounts to an insult of the LGBT community by an Academy consisting predominantly of white males in their 50s (there are also zero black nominees this year by the way). Some people seem to believe that any LGBT-themed movie is a good thing, even if it's as shallow as this one. But I see this kind of "made for straight audiences award grabber" as ignorant of the people it's supposed to be about - like "Stonewall", which forged a historic event to exclude trans women and drag queens. "The Danish Girl" is just as annoying and obsolete.

I understand why the casting is problematic , and I was hesitant about watching it for a long time, but after reading a lot about Lily's story and watching interviews with the cast I decided to give it a chance today.I was overwhelmed by emotions for the whole time.Eddie Redmayne is amazing in this movie, seriously.Phenomenal.Alicia Vikander really deserves that Oscar, her performance is also remarkable.It's visually stunning.The whole movie had this very special atmosphere that sent chills down my spine , in a good way.I could see that Eddie really put all of his heart into this. This movie is about unconditional love.Of course, above all, it's about Lili's journey , but the bond between her and Gerda is beautifully portrayed. (Don't worry, there will be no spoilers here) I think the ending was great.Simple, but meaningful.

I was amazed by every single second of this movie.

The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper and stars Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, Ben Whishaw and Matthias Schoenaerts. 

Loosely inspired by Danish artists Gerda Wegener and Lili Elbe, The Danish Girl explores the marriage of Lili & Gerda as they experience Lili's ambitious journey as a transgender pioneer.

Eddie Redmayne returns to the screen with admirable strength and skill, with such a diverse character to play. He is as convincing as Lili Elbe as he was Stephen Hawking. With his incredible portrayal in The Theory Of Everything, capturing everyone and gaining major attention from critics and the Academy, Redmayne is an actor who has stepped into the spotlight for filmmakers. And respectfully so. His portrayal of Lili in this film is remarkable, well handled and instantly worthy of the recognition. He gives off an electrifying performance and very emotionally attaches himself to the personality of this character. A truly brilliant performance. Alicia Vikander is magnetic as Gerda, she just clicks. Again, a very emotional performance throughout. I do believe she deserves more attention from the critics than she's getting at the moment. These are two of the four outstanding factors of this film. 

The third is the music by Alexandre Desplat. Absolutely beautiful piano melodies and string motifs as usual. He always writes with impeccable focus on the visuals and the touching performances on-screen. This is yet another score by Desplat that I will be happily purchasing.

The final pillar holding this film up is the visuals. The camera work is stunningly supportive of the story and screenplay. Slow, intimate and colourful.

Apart from these four points, I couldn't really attach myself to the film or its story. I felt it outstayed it's welcome after the 90 minute mark. If it were shorter by around 20-30 minutes I believe it would have flowed easier with less moments that felt out of place or less meaningful. Which is a bit sad when this is a story about such a compelling and controversial subject. It was handled with love and care but I didn't find myself feeling enthralled by anything particular. Don't get me wrong, it's very nicely written. But I wasn't deeply engaged as much as I should have been. It's a shame. I do, however, believe that it's a film that should be seen by everyone, and discussed beyond the award ceremonies. 

My verdict; The Danish Girl is a piece of art in itself for its wonderful visuals, music and performances by Redmayne and Vikander. If a little more care and attention was applied then this could have been a modern masterpiece. But don't let that turn you away, there's still something deeply planted in this film.

"I think Lily's thoughts, I dream her dreams. She was always there."

The Danish Girl, 7/10.

I am a person of short patience and I write my reviews for people who find most movies on IMDb over-rated. I enjoy history, existential issues, and biographies...so all of those interests of mine should be taken into account in regards to my opinion of this movie. At the time of writing this review its average rating is 5.8. I think that is a bit tight or a bit low. I would give it a 6.5. What I liked about the movie was the interesting story. I often complain about pace in a movie being too slow, but I think this was relatively well paced for a the telling of this couple's story. I find Eddie Redmayne to be overrated as an actor. This is consistent with his performance in this movie. He certainly looks great in the part, but I found his gasps and sighs in the early scenes to be rather unbelievable, as the character awkward and scared and learning to come to grips with the truth that his identity is not what it seems. I found him rather more believable as the newly blossoming trans-gendered girl, enjoying his femininity. Alicia Vikander as the wife of "Lilly/Einar" was outstanding. All of her emotions appear deep and authentic. Her pain at adjusting to all of the changes. Her struggle to let go of her husband because as she comes to realizes he is seeking out his essence. All in all, a reasonable portrayal of a couple's struggle.people might argue that the story lacks some of the important problems that face trans-gendered people, most notably, being repressed and rejected by society. But all politics aside, this is one person's story.

I like to think I'm as open minded as I can be. Perhaps if I was in a room with a bunch of transgender people they might not see me that way, but I think if I was in a room with a bunch of raving Republicans I would be seen as pretty darn liberal. I think I can defend my open mindedness simply due to the fact that I sat down and eagerly watched The Danish Girl with, well, an open mind. So it pains me to say that watching The Danish Girl I found myself at times laughing when it was not appropriate and also just wanting to gag when it was certainly not intended by the filmmakers. This film is about a guy who, after dressing up like a woman to appease his artist wife who needed a female model, finds himself addicted to dressing up in women's clothing, then succumbs to what can only be described as a schizophrenic bout of split personality during which he thinks he is a woman, resulting in several failed attempts to lock him up in an insane asylum before he finally comes across a surgeon who offers to quite literally cut his penis off and build him a makeshift vagina. This is not such a strange tale actually if it were happening today, I guess, but this tale is happening at the turn of the century (19th to 20th Century that is) and our supposed "transgender hero" {{SPOILER ALERT}} DIES as a result of the surgery!!!!

Seriously? Uck. Just, you know, uck.

Went in with high expectations and ended up almost dozing at the slow pace of this movie. Few highlights and drab backgrounds will not attract me to visit Copenhagen. Typical Oscar type movie, well acted by Redmayne and Vikander just a too slow movie pace. Redmaynes character didn't develop for me at all and I couldn't see it improving if I'd stayed longer so 65 mins into it I followed several others who had left early and noticed one guy fast asleep. The core subject as stated in the trailers and posters is Redmayne's exploration of the femininity side of humanity. All well and good in a psychiatrists consultation but for a movie no. Had this been made for TV it could better be serialised. This is just my opinion but I was bored by it however most folk will watch it and rate it for it's acting merit - I rate for watchability.

I will begin by saying that I'm still debating whether I should give this movie 1 star to make up for all those high rated reviews. 

As someone else stated in the comments, Eddie's character is so poorly researched, it's almost insulting to the trans community, I may not know a lot about this, but one does not dress in a costume as a favor and then identify themselves as another gender overnight... sure, the story wants to offer more background into this but fails to do to so at a satisfactory level. The main character comes across more likely to suffer from multiple personality disorder than being trans, and considering some less enlightened viewers still confuse sexual identity for pathology, this may be one of the most epic movie fails I have seen in years.

I should also add that the acting feels forced in some scenes, but that's mainly because many of those scenes are cliché so the actors don't have much to work with...... but man, if you've seen 10 movies in the past decade, the not-subtle-at-all foreshadowing will surely let you know how it ends. I had hopes for this, if you want a LGBT movie, see Carol!

Boring, boring, boring. If the only thing you want to see is Eddie Redmayne repeatedly dressing up in women's clothes, and portraying him/her in a a single repetitive way (that means putting a wig and a dress on Eddie, and when another character looks at him, cut to a close-up, have him look down with his eyes closed, open them, look up at them with his head still down, slightly cocked to the side, then have him sheepishly smile then this flick's for you. Gosh, that must have been done like 40 times, and they nominated him for an academy award for that). Otherwise, the characters are shallow, and there is no attempt to get to understand his desire to become a woman other than a superficial, quickly told set of occurrences and examples. Even the technical/medical aspects of his outcome is only glanced over inaccurately. 2 Hrs I'll never get back. Stay away! Save yourselves!

In the current crop of films, this stands both head and shoulders above the rest. The subject matter in my opinion was handled with a depth that is rearly seen in modern films, cinematography and expression of the whole environment, characters, subject and plot is second to none. The story flows and feels neither fast or slow but in time, bearing the soul of all it touches. My first thoughts on seeing the trailer was that a film like this could only touch at most skim the surface of this subject matter, but don't be fooled like me, be prepared as you will soon find yourself skill fully placed in this world seeing and feeling, maybe even understanding the whole point of it all. It both answers and asks questions of the viewer but not in intrusive or forceful way which is a brilliant stroke of genius. Definitely Oscar material as all of the actors and the people involved in this film should be proud of this wonderful piece of cinematography.

A fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolves as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer. 

The Danish Girl is adapted from David Ebershoff's novel by Tom Hooper, retelling a true-life-story. The point about the film, of course, is that it has two Danish heroines and that one of them started life as a Danish boy. Well-meaning and polished as it is, this film is determinedly mainstream melodrama that doesn't really offer new perspectives in theme; in the year of Caitlin Jenner, it's a theme on which mainstream audiences are ready for more trenchant insight. In fact, some might have wished for a more adventurous approach to this moving story, particularly at a time when transgender representation has taken over from gay rights as the next equality frontier. If the movie remains safe, there's no questioning its integrity or the balance of porcelain vulnerability that Eddie Redmayne brings to the lead role. 

For an actor, there can be few more challenging roles than this, in which the nature of identity, performance and transformation are all wrapped up in the very DNA of the character itself. Redmayne gives an infinitely more intimate performance and far less technical than the already stunning character he played in The Theory of Everything, that so recently won him an Oscar. He's once again certain to reap plentiful laurels in this awards season; with another role about a slow process of physical and psychological transformation. Einar's dawning discovery of his inner woman is treated somewhat like a superhero origin story. Offering more light and shade this character becomes undeniably affecting. There's an understated emotional surge in seeing Lili go to work behind a chic department store perfume counter, radiating happiness at being a woman among other women and timidly studying sensual female body language in a Paris peepshow, is one of the film's most exquisite and indelible scenes. Here, Alicia Vikander sports the same archly knowing English accent as in Testament of Youth. 

Tom Hopper and writer Lucinda Dixon take a deeply conventional approach by framing their story as a portrait of a loving marriage with an awkward flaw. The cinematography sets up the exquisite visual tone at the start with a series of atmospheric, deeply painterly landscape shots. There are hints of a more interesting film. 

Overall, this film is an impeccably made period piece.
