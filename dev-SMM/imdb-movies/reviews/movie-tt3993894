### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I went into Queen of the Earth with so much good will. The premise sounds like it has a great deal of potential - a woman's (Elizabeth Moss) father dies and she goes to try and get away from everything in the wake of this and breaking up with her boyfriend to a cabin by a lake that her best friend (Katharine Waterston) has, and from there she starts to lose her mind. I hadn't seen The Color Wheel or Listen up Phillip, the previous Alex Ross Perry films, but I am an admirer of Elizabeth Moss (just last year she was in a little seen but awesome indie movie, The One I Love), and I thought she could pull off a deep and interesting character. The trouble is, the resulting film Queen of the Earth isn't deep or interesting, though it would very much like to be and pretends to be.

It paigns me to rag on a film that is trying to be ambitious in the psychological/interior sense. It's not that the world lacks independent film dramas dealing with loss and mental instability, but it's always good to have well made ones that let the audience in to the character's pain and, perhaps, see that person grow. But the core problem with the movie is that it doesn't give enough context for the main character's misery. In a sense the format reminded me of Lars von Trier's Antichrist, only without the hilarious fox or over-the-top antics involving castration: someone loses a loved one, they go off to the middle of the woods with a close friend, and then the bile spews out. And Queen of the Earth is nothing but an experience where characters are loaded with bile to one another scene after scene.

Of course a story dealing with grief and loss and mental fractions should be taking itself seriously, of course... but maybe it should also allow a tone that doesn't hit the same ugly sensations. Even in the flashbacks Moss and Waterston's characters are sniping at one another in passive-aggressive or just aggressive ways, and even the (very) few semi-happy moments are tinged with the flavor of dread. After an opening shot where we see Moss crying and in hysterics - and to be fair, it's an amazingly acted and shot scene - it never really loses that tone, and yet we also never get a sense of WHERE and WHO this character was at before all of this; it's all told to us (that she had a father who was reviled, that she is reviled as a "spoiled brat", that she should get over herself, her art, etc).

Part of the approach may be due to the low-budget - Perry didn't quite get started with the 'mumblecore' filmmakers, but he's in the same ballpark - and yet there's little actual creativity, or any sense of empathy that the audience can have in the writing, at least from my perspective. Part of the problem too is due to the style, where Perry gets composer Keegan DeWitt to hit the same ominous, horror-movie notes, and it's draining. In scene after scene it's as though we are locked in with one woman, Catherine, who is a head-case and is becoming undone further and further along (the same tone is basically, 'why can't they leave me alone') and she is not that interesting as a miserable character, and Virginia is even worse. There's no arc with either of these people, no sense of growth whether it's up or down (well, I guess Catherine DOES get worse, but you know what I mean, the trajectory is muddled and shallow); that may be part of the point, but it doesn't work in this case.

I can see why the film was made, to bring a full atmospheric experience through eerie-grainy 16mm cinematography, and to highlight how, well I guess, society people are people too. But aside from Moss's performance, as she really is trying and going for this full- throttle (she produced too), Queen of the Earth comes off as a miserable, empty time.

So, I really wasn't a fan of Alex Ross Perry's last film Listen Up Philip. That's all I have to base him on. I felt there were a few redeeming aspects going for it, but generally it was an unpleasant experience. It's biggest redeeming aspect? Easily Elisabeth Moss. She played Philip's recovering ex-girlfriend with such tender vulnerability that Perry's ineptitude as a writer and director couldn't get in her way. She makes the film worthwhile when the film could have easily chopped off her subplot and remained the same. Though to clarify, her performance is good, her story is a drag. In theory, Queen of Earth was the perfect next move. A focused movie letting Moss let loose with the unhinged side of her character from Listen Up. And yet, it went so wrong. Someone must have hurt Alex Ross Perry bad. The only thing he has to thoughtlessly spray about people are mean-spirited bites with absolutely no finesse. I don't mind cynical films or characters, but not when they bring absolutely nothing insightful to the table. It's an ugly spite that dives into the unpleasant side of unpleasant people without essential epiphanies.

Instead, Perry has his 'queen of earth' blame everyone else for her problem sans any hint of irony. It's far too self-serious and unsatisfying. It's lazy writing when the backstory is much more interesting than what they're showing on screen, especially when its many flashbacks refuse to divulge into it. It's not necessarily a clumsy film, but it's a very pretentious in its composition and rhythm as if it's the next Persona or 3 Women. How many minuscule scenes do we need of the two leading women walking by each other tensely in a room? I'd like to say Katherine Waterston saves it in a co-leading opportunity, but in Perry's hands she's worse than Moss. I forgive both actresses and Patrick Fugit, but the material they had to work with is so petty and flat, never probing into deeper human needs, only superficial selfish desires that have no third dimension. I could kind of get into it at first, the opening prologue shot for example is very compelling, but it just never finds its way from there. At least its photography isn't quite as incompetent, though Perry is trapping me in his closeups again. It makes Listen Up Philip look well developed in comparison.

To me, this was one of those supposed deep dramas that produced only unlikable characters, espousing psychological drivel throughout, and thus in the end just became ponderous and irritating to watch. Often told through flashbacks, it held my interest for a while, wondering where it was all going. I should have know better because it ended up going nowhere, all the way to its highly ambiguous finale.

Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston star as Catherine and Virginia respectively. Catherine has come up to her best friend Virginia's family vacation home to get some rest and relaxation. Her emotional state is quite unstable, after her father, a renowned artist committed suicide, and her partner has told her he's having an affair with another woman.

If these two women are best friends, I wouldn't like to meet their enemies, because Catherine and Virginia are constantly bickering at their best moments and being cruel and hostile to each other at their worst. They're joined from time to time by Virginia's neighbor Rich (Patrick Fugit), who's in a relationship of some sorts with Virginia, and who seems to delight in "adding fuel to the fire" whenever he can to provoke the unstable Catherine.

All in all, I imagine the writer and director here Alex Ross Perry, was aiming for a deep meaningful film, but all I found it to be was a tedious and irritating waste of time.

Greetings again from the darkness. Friendship doesn't just happen. It requires constant maintenance along with give and take from both sides. When a long time friendship between Catherine and Virginia devolves into a passive-aggressive game of emotional "tag, you're it", the result is an unusual psychological expose' on self-indulgence and grieving.

Writer/director Alex Ross Perry follows up his critically acclaimed LISTEN UP PHILIP with a glimpse into the complexities of friendship between two women who seem mostly clueless to both their world of privilege, and their not-so-subtle narcissism. Both Catherine and Virginia have experienced personal tragedies at different times, and their friendship has basically crumbled due to the responses of each woman towards the other.

A startling opening scene serves up a very emotional Elisabeth Moss (Catherine) as she and her boyfriend (Kentucker Audley) argue their way through an ugly break-up due to his infidelity on the heels of the suicide of Catherine's dad and mentor. The rest of the movie covers the week (each day marked by a scripted placard) that Catherine spends with her best friend at Virginia's (Katherine Waterston, Sam's daughter) family lake house. Flashbacks cover the previous year's visit under much different circumstances, but it's the intimate  and often quite uncomfortable  moments between the two women that provides the crux of the film.

Director Perry focuses a great deal of attention on the faces of Catherine and Virginia  many of these are extreme close-ups that leave thoughts unspoken, yet quite clear to the viewer. There are elements of 1970's schlock horror films  but not in a bad way. The music, atmosphere and camera angles have a certain retro feel, but the tension between the two friends is palpable and timeless.

Perry's script and the performances of Moss and Waterston tap into that nasty bit of human nature that makes us believe our problems are much worse than anyone else's. Building on that, the animosity felt when our friends aren't "there for us" in times of trauma, can lead to a dangerous slope that affects judgment and mental stability. Watching Catherine and Virginia go at it has elements of truth and dread.

Patrick Fugit appears in a few scenes as Virginia's neighbor, and his sole purpose seems to be to torment Catherine  at least that's how she sees it. The juxtaposition of the two visits (separated by one year) makes for some very interesting character observations, and helps us understand the delusions and bitterness. It's an interesting and stylish little film that doesn't so much entertain as spur introspection.

Slowmoving psychological drama about a woman with a mental state that's on a downward spiral after her father died.

Has a bit of a eerie 70's mystery feeling to it stylewise both visually and emotionally (even though it takes place in now time).

But instead of getting intrigued I just found it rather dull instead, perhaps a bit to do with the fact that I didn't find anything particularly likable about any of the characters (or interesting for that matter) and they were all fairly self-absorbed.

And some scenes just go on forever with mumbling monologues of which I often found myself not knowing what exactly they were talking about because for one they mumbled quietly and also the eerie music was really loud, so that didn't really help, and the ending is rather abrupt.

So yeah what can I say, not for me I guess.

'QUEEN OF EARTH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

A psychological thriller flick written and directed by indie filmmaker, and actor, Alex Ross Perry. It tells the story of two childhood friends, that reunite at a lake house, as adult women, and find out they no longer feel close. The movie stars Elisabeth Moss, Katherine Waterston and Patrick Fugit. Perry and Moss were also producers on the film, along with Adam Piotrowicz and the very prolific Joe Swanberg. The movie is very impressive, stylistically speaking, but it's also a little bit of a mess, from a dramatic storytelling point of view. 

Catherine (Moss) and Virginia (Waterston) are two women, who were very close while growing up. They've continued to reunite, every summer, at a vacation lake house; owned by Virginia's family. Over the past few years, they've started to grow apart; and became very bitter towards each other. Their recent relations with men, have really driven the two to a breaking point; as Catherine also starts to lose her sanity.

The movie is very beautifully shot, and the music is haunting and very memorable; with a classic (and very campy) B movie feel to it. The film is played out like a thriller, but it's actually more of a dramatic character study; and it's an excellent examination of female relationships (and mental illness) as well. Moss and Waterston are both really good in the film, and Perry's direction is excellent. It's not a perfect film, but it is a memorable one.

Queen of Earth follows a woman who, after her boyfriend breaks up with her, goes on a trip to a somewhat secluded cabin with her best friend, and ultimately they run into some troubles in their relationship.

I liked how this movie was shot. There were some pretty lengthy shots that were just people talking, meaning that they had to memorize a lengthy set of lines and recite them while maintaining their character. Moreover, some of the shots were just kind of pretty to look at. 

There were some cool ideas. The way it tried to use symbolism and portray the main character's ongoing conflict was kind of cool, but unfortunately it didn't work out. 

The biggest thing that really brought this movie down was the dialogue. I've seen bad dialogue and writing before, but this tops all of those. Characters often embark on long lectures and speeches that sound like they were both pre-written and practiced. Not only was the dialogue unrealistic, but the meaning of it was also awful. The two main characters, who are supposedly best friends, spend the entire movie elaborately telling each other why they are each horrible people. And they definitely aren't being sarcastic. How are these people still friends? Even in their flashback conversations they just trash-talk each other. Now you could argue that maybe I'm pointing out only the bad conversations they have, but they never say anything nice to each other. I recall one line from the entire movie where one of them says that she likes the other. That line was immediately followed by hate, however. So the movie never actually shows us that the two main characters are best friends despite stating that they are. 

Overall Queen of Earth is a bad movie. Sure, there were some cool ideas and pretty shots, but the dialogue is so incredibly awful that it's hard to enjoy really any part of this movie. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie.

I just finished watching this film and came here to read what other people thought about it. I was left with several impressions, perhaps the first being an echo of what's been written in other reviews which is that Elisabeth Moss's performance is stunning. She's a very interesting actress to me, in that her looks are not conventionally pretty and yet she has an awesome face because of the emotion she's able to convey through it. She strikes me as someone I would like to know, and that's not something I experience often. There is something so human and compassionate about her. But now I'm not sure how much of this is her and how much is the role she played here.

Throughout much of this film I was almost eager for it to be over. It is slow, with many long shots of both the two main characters, and inanimate things such as stairs, paintings, and the lake. I especially like what another reviewer said which was something like the script and plot of this film are in the drama genre, whereas the setting, and music are like a horror film. (Sorry for the paraphrasing.) There was such an underlying tension throughout, which I'm sure was intended. I'm not so sure whether the confusion I felt throughout much of it was also intended. For example, I couldn't really understand the relationship between Moss's character and that of Katherine Waterston's. There seemed to be so little good feeling between them, that it was hard to understand why they were even spending time together, beside it being their annual ritual.

In the end, and this is the kind of film I feel the need to see again, I'd say it was really about a woman's descent into madness. Through the flashbacks we learn that Catherine (Moss) had some problems before the death of her father, but that during the week that the film depicts, she unravels, and gets "worse" every day, that is, more paranoid, manic, and depressed. The ending was also ambiguous; she has gone, but the question of where, lingers. Did she ultimately jump into the lake and commit suicide like her father, or did she get herself together and leave a bad situation. I wonder if anyone besides the writer and director knows.

If you're into psychological films, films about madness, or just enjoy watching great acting, definitely catch Queen of Earth.

I like movies, all kinds. I've probably seen upwards of 4000 to 4500 movies. Occasionally I like to see a smaller, independent film like this one, it is good to see what types of new approaches are being tried.

I found this on Netflix streaming movies. The reviews and comments are all over the place, from "I hated this trash" to "A really fine character study."

My own evaluation is somewhere in between the two extremes, it is an interesting experiment but to me fails on most accounts.

Elisabeth Moss is Catherine, whose successful and well-known artist father has recently died. She too is an artist, not as accomplished, and has gone into a funk of sorts. To refresh herself she travels to spend a week with her "best friend" at the friend's secluded lake house and do some drawing too.

The friend is British actress Katherine Waterston doing a very authentic American accent as Virginia. We really get no backstory and are struck by how severe, judgmental, and uncaring Virginia seems to be. In fact she talks at one point about how she relishes getting people out of her life, including her newborn that we never really find out about.

Then there is Patrick Fugit who is the intrusive lake house neighbor Rich. He is good but I hadn't seen him in anything since he was a teenager in "Almost Famous" and seeing him as a 30-something is a bit disconcerting. My fault, not the movie's.

Anyway the problem I have with the movie is I never saw the main characters as having realistic conversations and discussions, as normal friends might. I was always aware that they were working off a script that someone wrote. And if the interactions between friends didn't seem real, what does that leave us with? Nothing because there is no big "ah-ha" moment before the ending.

I am glad I saw it, I could not recommend it to anyone else.

I loved "Listen Up Philip" and found "The Color Wheel" very interesting (if also annoying), so I was very psyched for this latest by ARP. I'm not sure what it ultimately adds up to, script-wise, or how much weight it would have at all if not for the lead performance. But what a performance. Moss is remarkable. It's one of those descent-into-madness performances that's so riveting it almost doesn't matter that the narrative and explicating psychology are sketchy at best. I suppose that's partly the point--that our understanding of what is happening to the character is as fragmentary as her own understanding of it--but nonetheless it's a little frustrating. That doesn't matter all that much, though, because Moss is so fascinating to watch. Eventually I'll see the movie again, not only to experience that performance a second time, but also to see if the film has more substance to it (independent on that star turn) than it appeared at first glance.

Queen of Earth is a character study of a depressed woman who unravels following death, scandal, and a break-up. She spends a week at a high end lake side house belonging to a friend.

The visit, which should have been a calm, nurturing respite from her personal tragedies turns into a gut wrenching week. Her friend lacks the patience and empathy to help her heal. Instead she pushes her further into depression and decompensation.

Elizabeth Moss is brilliant with this long, slow disintegration. I could compare her performance to Elizabeth Taylor in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' or Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf. 

Katherine Waterston, daughter of the beloved Law and Order actor San Waterston, plays a hard edged, unkind, and self centered rich girl. She is unable to help her friend with debilitating depression. In fact she worsens the situation with her criticism, and harsh comments. She is a slender brunette with Ali McGraw looks. Look for more good work from this actress.

The movie moves slow as a glacier. The visual elements are very simple. The lovely house, the lake, and the faces of the two actresses are the main elements. Extremely important is the music. 

The musical score establishes the mood, the dread, the tension, the intense unease which characterizes this film. A woman walking down a flight of steps turns into a tense and anxious scene because of the musical score. Another writer/director would have used a voice over to communicate with the audience. Director Alex Ross Perry uses music.

I believe this is only the 4th film by Alex Perry. I think it is a very ambitious undertaking. It is similar in pace and mood to the Lars von Trier film Melancholia. I look forward to more films from Alex Ross Perry.

This is not for every one. It is a very slow and unhappy movie. The characters are not likable. The men are horrid. It is a study of two women and a friendship which is no longer viable. It is a study of a woman who loses her grip on reality and has no one to help her. It is an excellent film with a brilliant performance worthy of an Oscar by Elizabeth Moss.

Imagine that you were instructed to make a film featuring two just modestly attractive women that are (and fortunately for them can financially afford to be) wholly self-possessed, narcissistic, mean-spirited and just plain vile. Worse, the two supporting actors are written as pretty much one-dimensional foils, bereft of any back-story or pretty much any focus. Surprise, this Alan Ross Perry guy comes up with an gripping -almost suspenseful- psychodrama that'll have you cringing and slack-jaw with no more than dialog. Elisabeth Moss is just sensational as is Katherine Waterston. At the end of the film you're not really rooting for, expecting or supporting any character or climax. Rather, you're simply stunned. I like being stunned.

=====THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS=====

I went to watch this film with an open mind, knowing a relatively small amount about its storyline other than a brief synopsis. This is supposed to be a thriller. I cannot say I felt any tension, any fear, any anticipation. All I ended up doing was become increasingly annoyed at the 1st AC who kept missing his focus marks.

The film is essentially Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" crossed with Wiseau's "The Room". Mulholland Drive made no sense and you were constantly introduced to new ideas which led nowhere - this film is the same. Like The Room, it features a dull and clichéed screenplay (though at least in The Room it was delivered in such an entertaining way that one could still watch it with enjoyment) which doesn't hold any sort of story together. You spend most of the film expecting it to lead somewhere, and it never does. Perhaps the director wanted to give a nod to The Room when he introduced the completely pointless character sleeping outside.

Cinematically, the film's editor uses tacky fonts to establish settings and continuously cuts to shots of rippling water for no apparent reason. As each day progresses in the story, the same thing just happens over and over again. Sometimes there will be some horrific colour temperature changes from one cut to the next that instantly jump out. Other times you're left watching a generally out-of-focus Katherine Waterston running for a good 20 seconds for no apparent reason.

One long scene in the middle of the film could have been left out and would have made no difference. The performance is only impressive if it adds to the story, and with such a linear and mundane storyline, it is lost on the audience, particularly on the strange ECUs which linger far too long and go in and out of focus too many times to keep count.

Most unforgivable is the easily avoidable breaking of the fourth wall during a scene where Katherine Waterston is wearing sunglasses and we are treated to a very clear reflection of the boom operator THREE TIMES! I am amazed nobody noticed during filming.

Elsewhere on the sound front, there are several scenes which feature horrible audio bytes of character interaction with loud objects, which should be avoided where possible as it's just difficult to concentrate with rustling packets taking prominence over a character's dialogue.

Unfortunately, I think any quality in acting which exists in the film is let down by the cinematography and the screenplay. And most other things. And if the director wanted to make it a cult classic like The Room, I'm afraid he hasn't made it.

"Queen of Earth" sets is unsettling tone right from the get-go, by opening on a static shot of Catherine (Elisabeth Moss), who's face is soaked from her own tears and her makeup smeared all around her eyes. She's in the middle of arguing with her boyfriend, who confirms he has been seeing someone else, and he's delivering this news to her shortly after her father committed suicide. After arguing back and forth for about two minutes, he takes off, Catherine's sitting alone with tears coating her face, and director Alex Ross Perry has "Queen of Earth" flash over her face in pink, cursive lettering, mimicking the style of film title cards from decades gone past.

The film then focuses on Catherine staying with her best friend Virginia ("Ginny"), played by Katherine Waterston, at Virginia's beach house, as she does every year. Last year, Catherine came with her boyfriend and a rather clear mind, thanks to a cushy job as her artist father's assistant. Now, she is without a job and without the anchor of her boyfriend. Catherine was so used to being codependent on both her father and her boyfriend; one can tell just from the opening scene that she always put her needs in the back of her mind to attend to her boyfriend's and, as her father's assistant, had to do the same thing on a daily basis. Now, Catherine is left with her own vices, of which she can't remember being the sole burden. She's hostile to Virginia and Virginia's new sorta-boyfriend Rich (Patrick Fugit), who shows up uninvited on numerous occasions to, what Catherine thinks, provoke her, and spends most of her days either lying in bed, being passive aggressive to everyone, or , worst of all, going into an emotional tizzy with unexpected consequences for everyone around her.

If the comedic masterpiece "The Color Wheel" failed to do it and "Listen Up Philip" didn't strike a chord significant enough, "Queen of Earth" should solidify Alex Ross Perry as one of the most talented American filmmakers of our time. His films, at their core, are comedies, even this one, as dark as it gets at times, but his approaches and moods are what make them different. Consider some of the conversations Catherine and Virginia have about their exes, in addition to some of the flashback scenes of Catherine and Virginia's vacations from years ago - both can become quite comedic, even if they are heavily built on monologues. The difference with this film is that Perry interjects copious amounts of tension into "Queen of Earth," and it's tension that you could cut with a knife.

The funny thing is Perry doesn't capitalize on any effects here that the tension could build to: no cheapshots, no reveals, no jumpscares, and nothing of blatant conventionality. He allows the characters to operate in their own spheres with their own ideas and it's when we see these spheres clash that the tension begins to surface, in addition to some beautifully low-key piano music composed by Keegan DeWitt. This is a film with the plot and character structure of a drama but the cinematography, pace, and tension of a horror film.

Catherine Moss deserves an Oscar for her completely electrifying performance as somebody so mentally unstable that she herself can barely stand up in some scenes. Moss's facial expressions, long stares into nowhere, and sporadic emotional tirades that are defined solely by the quiver in her voice and the position of her eyebrows are absolutely mesmerizing and the work of a true character actress. Alongside her is Waterston, who has an equally challenging role, as the reciprocal of Moss's character's often hurtful attacks and accusations. Waterston has to respond to Moss's viciousness in a believable way and she handles the task nicely, especially given her often thankless position in this film.

At the end of it all, however, in its examination of depression and erratic behavior stemming from depression, "Queen of Earth" also shows the horrors of codependency and the result of spending so much time investing in others that you forget to take care of yourself. At times, Catherine isn't as depressed as she seems, but so hopelessly lost and incapable of expressing her emotions. That winds up being the scariest thing of all, beyond any scenario of jumpscare, simply because what's going on inside your mind is your own business and the incapability of expressing it to others leaves you helpless and crying (literally) for some sort of guidance. For Perry to do this largely without voiceovers or long-winded monologues once again shows his talent as a writer/director. "Queen of Earth" looks at the horrors of the human condition beautifully and, in addition to all the tension, atmospheric dread, and ominous music Perry throws in the film, winds up being one of the most mesmerizing and haunting films of the year.

"Queen of Earth" is a great film. Based off the other reviews here, I think this film is under appreciated.

This film takes a hard look at the complexities and imbalances that occur in long term friendships. As two people get to know each other for longer and longer, facades of politeness and patience slide away as character flaws are exposed. The two women in this story - Catherine and Virginia - have developed a deep understanding of how the other thinks, feels and fears and, for better or for worse, use this to their further their own emotional agendas.

Set entirely in a vacation house in the woods, Catherine has come to Virginia for support after her father died and her boyfriend broke up with her - leaving her emotionally shipwrecked and her life in shambles. Virginia is stuck between caring for her overbearing friend and addressing the ways Catherine mistreated and took advantage of her in the past.

The two women hurl mean thoughts to each other in the form of hard truths - or at least things that they believe to be true. At first glance, it is surprising to see how such a volatile relationship can be sustained as a friendship. However, as the film progresses, we see the need for each character to have someone in their life that may not care for them but, at the very least, understand and be present for them.

The depth of the emotional drama is complemented by the creative camera-work and the beautiful, foreboding soundtrack which elevates this story to something of an emotional thriller. In more ways than one, the building of psychological tension between the women is as exciting as a suspenseful, murder film.

I don't want to give anything away, but there are instances in the film where the story disappears into Catherine's delusions and hallucinations that I personally found over the top and not necessary. I think the film was stronger without it. Additionally, this film does not provide any sort of resolution but I feel in that sense this story mirrors life. Very rarely do we have the privilege of closure in complicated relationships but, by consuming art that addresses the subject, we can better understand them.

If you are inspired and intrigued by films such as Ingmar Bergman's "Persona", Woody Allen's "Hannah and her Sisters" and the midcentury plays of Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neil - all stories about characters who simultaneously love and hate each other, than this film is definitely for you.

Last year, Catherine brought her boyfriend James which infuriated Virginia. Catherine works with her fame artist father. This year, she's devastated by his recent suicide. Catherine invites annoying Rich (Patrick Fugit) to their quiet retreat.

I couldn't figure out this female friendship for the longest time. The movie has a lot of flashbacks and it's a struggle to understand the time/context. It's a relationship jigsaw puzzle. It's hard to understand why these two like each other but it does a great reveal at the end. At times, the movie shows that Catherine is psychologically breaking down which leaves the story telling untrustworthy. I wonder if making them sisters would be more compelling. As friends, it's unlikely that Catherine would stay with the rape-creepy Rich around.

'Queen of Earth' is a decent indie movie. Nothing spectacular, but certainly worth a watch if you like slow-burning psychological dramas. 

The movie is about Catherine (Elisabeth Moss), a woman on the brink of insanity, who spends a week at a lakeside vacation house with her estranged best friend Virginia (Katherine Waterston). Through flashbacks, we get to see the rather joyful person Catherine was merely a year ago, who stands in stark contrast to the basket case she has become after some unfortunate events in her life.

Elisabeth Moss stands out in the lead role. Her acting is very expressive. I also like that the director chose to shoot on 16 mm film. It gives the movie that certain ominous look of horror movies from days gone by, even though it is not a horror movie, and I wouldn't classify it as a thriller either.

'Queen of Earth' is a psychological drama in the vein of Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion' (1965) and 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) or Sebastián Silva's more recent 'Magic Magic' (2013), albeit without the tangible "horror" elements of those movies and much more rooted in the ordinary world. This is a movie about the horrors of the everyday as it were.

"Queen of Earth" is a difficult, disturbing movie. It reminds me of Altman's "3 Women", with the use of unbearable silence, dissonant soundtracks, and characters whose motivations are hard to understand, in situations hard for us to contextualise. It is not as haunting as that movie, though, and therefore not as good. I don't think this is one I'm going to be thinking about much after having seen it.

The plot concerns two "best friends" who go away for a week together despite the fact that they don't seem to like each other much. One, the main character, has just been dumped by her boyfriend who was with her when she went away with the same best friend last year. There is also a guy, kind of like an antagonist, who was with the friend last year and has shown up this year again, much to the protagonist's discomfort.

There are some very intense scenes, such as the main character breaking down at a party, and the movie seems to be becoming an enthralling descent into madness, but then it abruptly changes gear, and not for the first time. It's not going to give you any easy answers like that, but in this case, I also came up short on questions.

Films are made for many purposes and I don't know what this one is about. They say it is a psychological-thriller, but yes, there is some psychology in it, but definitely no thriller, just a boring drama which means a character study material. The entire film was shot in a lake house and occasionally its surrounding area. There is no story in it, just the characters and they're being themselves that narrated in the days basis for a week, but those days were from the random years without a clear picture of what date, month or the year.

There is lots of close up shots like it pushes you back from your seat suppose if you are leaning towards the front. The cinematography was what I felt uncomfortable, but overall not bad. I think the actors were good, both Katherine Waterston and Elisabeth Moss, just for this film because I've seen them in the better roles.

Low budget and limited cast film, as well as short but not sweet as I anticipated. So I don't think everybody would enjoy it, I don't know who is the target audience, but I'm sure it will reach them who are going to defend it from people like me. Those who are not seen it, but want to, I only advise them to be careful while choosing it.

Enjoyable performance by Elisabeth Moss that mesmerizes viewer keeping the suspense high, but honestly it is misleading to call it a thriller... No thriller at all, if we omit the music that yes could be from a thriller. Congratulations to the director for making uninteresting events in one's life sound like lines from an ancient Greek tragedy. Honestly, it takes talent, as the film proves that HOW is more important than WHAT. To come again to Elisabeth Moss she is a high quality, A class actress that can play anything she likes. PS, the description "Two women who grew up together discover they have drifted apart when they retreat to a lake house together" should be revised.

Double bill time! US indie filmmaker Alex Ross Perry's two latest offerings, vary in their own strains, LISTEN UP PHILIP is a Woody Allen-esque drama-comedy and QUEEN OF EARTH probes into a more psycho-horror genre without resorting to cheap scare.

The former, stars Schwartzman as the titular Philip Lewis Friedman, an up-and-coming novelist is on the cusp of publishing his second novel, but finds himself in contradictions with everything in his life. Wearing a seasonally-inappropriate jacket, a metaphor of his failure of accustoming his ever-distending ego to the reality, Philip waywardly puts a damper on the relationship with his live- in girlfriend of two years, Ashley (Moss), an aspiring photographer, after he accepts an open-end invitation from a venerable writer Ike Zimmerman (Pryce), whom he vastly admires, to stay with him in the latter's country house under the pretext of rendering a finishing touch to his upcoming novel.

Cynical as me, an instantaneous question emerges, why Zimmerman wants to help Philip at the first place? Since what we have been imbued as far is that Philip is an objectionable egomaniac who may or may not have the potential to be a sterling writer, betrays his sexist stance and well- conceived jealousy as soon as he has the possibility to achieve something (Ashley has always been the breadwinner in their relationship). Cunningly the downside of Ike's seemingly comfy life bares itself, he needs Philip - not just as an impressionable young man to whom he can impart his wisdom, as much as Philip needs him, the tension between him and his daughter Melanie (Ritter), the writer's blocks and shrouding loneliness consume his strength, more pragmatically and pathetically he needs Philip to be his wingman if he want to get laid with younger chicks. So, to answer my question, Ike sees himself in Philip, and Philip takes him as a role model, they share the same rotten DNAs. Great writers can inspire epiphany and confer wisdom to readers through their erudite thoughts and conception, one might think they (or at least the really estimable ones) would lead a sensible and judicious life, obviously Perry cannot second that.

Introduced by an obtrusively wordy voice-over (Bogosian), continues like a running commentary rambling on the characters' pickles with unapologetically pseudo-intellectual eloquence; shot with hand-held immediacy and close-ups a gogo, LISTEN UP PHILIP is at its worst being too quirky and conceited in its high-brow affectations, while at its best retaining an honest take on a real-life jerk's ups-and-downs, significantly owing to a well-chosen cast, Schwartzman is in his wheelhouse to be mercilessly arrogant and self-centred, which otherwise, accentuates Moss' visceral and layered performance which gratifyingly holds the ground in the finale, and Pryce has been allotted with munificent screen-time to establish Ike as someone whose remorse is as vague as his smugness.

In QUEEN OF EARTH, Alex Ross Perry ventures into a more daring and unsettling territory, pairs Moss and Waterston as two life-long friends Catherine and Virginia, but intriguingly pivots around the mental deterioration of Catherine, who has not only recently loses her artist father (in suicide), not also in the opening sequences, breaks up with her longtime boyfriend James (Audley).

Immediately the camera takes us to a lake house retreat, which is owned by Virginia's uncle. Catherine is invited by Virginia to stay with her there, to recuperate from the nadir. Then flashbacks and cutaways shows that one year earlier, before Catherine losing those two important men in her life, she and James had also spent their vacation with Virginia in the same place, and the atmosphere was not all that pleasant, the two girls were bickering all the time, throwing snide at each other, do they suppose to be besties?

The tranquility doesn't quite work in favour of Catherine, who has no interest in swimming in the lake or jogging in the morning, as if she is struck by some strange lethargy, and the interaction between them is also not wholesome, constantly felt being watched by Virginia, Catherine tip-toes around when she is making phone-calls, their intimate conversations loses its momentum pretty quickly, although, nothing really happens, Catherine becomes increasingly watchful and retreats to herself, especially after the advent of Rich (Fugit), Virginia's man friend lives nearby, whom Catherine and James met also one years before.

Imposing a more static strategy of framing, this time, Perry collectedly deploys natural sound (humming, droning, whirring, rustling) and an unsettlingly ambient score from DeWitt as major players in the game, together they suffuse the narrative as a haunting and mythifying undertone, fittingly trace out Catherine's paranoia and slide. After the sly (if not entirely unnecessary) implications of a murder (with a discombobulating cameo from Keith Poulson) and body horror (the pain in the face could lead to an apposite nightmarish scenario when the bones beneath are struggling for emergence), Catherine consummates her meltdown by giving Rich a mind-blowing dressing-down and later a creepy surrender-pleading-seduction combo to further throw herself down to the mental dysfunctional abyss. Moss is unbelievably versatile and emotive here, chilling, disquieting and unforgiving and Waterston proves herself a dab hand of deception and subtlety in her passive-aggressive retribution.

That's when Perry cagily divulges the reason behind in the last snippet of flashback, if everything turns out to be a carefully planned revenge, could it justify the entire story? It's a tricky question, but one thing is for sure, QUEEN OF EARTH is a surprising oddity endeavours to fearlessly tap into the boundary and essential compositions of friendship between two (female) friends, and artfully construes its aftermath with a firm sleight-of-hand.

Queen of Earth is a sensational portrait of a woman's descent into mental illness, and ultimately a reductive one. 

Perhaps Elisabeth Moss (who plays Catherine) isn't a strong enough actress to pull off the part? More likely, Alex Ross Perry isn't a strong enough writer/director to tackle the subject matter.

Compare Queen of Earth to the films of Lars von Trier or Roman Polanski. Both directors have presented compelling portraits of women in crisis, or women suffering from mental illness, or women accused of mental illness, etc... in films such as Rosemary's Baby and Melancholia (both of which are referenced in Queen of Earth).

Alex Ross Perry's approach to the subject of women and mental illness, on the other hand, can be summarized by a scene in which Virginia (Katherine Waterston) reads a book entitled "Madness & Women". Virginia doesn't read the book aloud, but holds the book prominently for the audience to see.

Two points about the book:

(1) The overall film is like the book cover, all surface. Rather than delve deeper into the subject matter, Alex Ross Perry remains on the surface. His references (to films such as Rosemary's Baby and Melancholia) are limited to the style. As if Alex Ross Perry said, "I'm going to make a film about a madwoman. What does a madwoman look like. What does a film about a madwoman look like?" And then appropriated accordingly. The inclusion of a book entitled "Madness & Women" sacrifices the last shred of subtlety (there wasn't much to begin with). Alex Ross Perry, by insisting upon a theme with a book cover rather than with text (perhaps preemptively rejecting the accusation that his film is all style and no substance), confirms that the film is indeed all style and no substance. (The inclusion of a book with the title "Madness & Women" is about as subtle as Martin Scorsese including a shot of a rat at the end of The Departed.)

(2) The book in question, "Madness & Women" by Ike Zimmerman, is not a real book but a book written by the character Ike Zimmerman (played by Jonathan Pryce) in Alex Ross Perry's previous film, Listen Up Philip. Rather than researching the subject matter with the obvious goal of creating an insightful portrayal, Alex Ross Perry is more interested in being self-referential and appearing clever.

In the end, Alex Ross Perry delivers a stylish and empty film about a hysterical woman. Unconcerned by the reductive implications of resurrecting the outdated archetype of the "hysterical woman", Alex Ross Perry emphasizes Catherine's hysteria by ending the film with a shot of her laughing hysterically. Even after the image of the hysterical woman laughing hysterically transitions into the end credits, the sound of her laughter is still audible. She is a woman reduced to her hysteria (by her unspecified mental illness), and a hysteria reduced to laughter (by the films uneducated director).

"Queen of Earth" follows a week's vacation at a summer house between two friends, Catherine (Elisabeth Moss) and Virginia (Katherine Waterston). Catherine, who has recently lost her artist father to suicide, is emotionally numb and fragile, and a rift begins to form when a male neighbor (Patrick Fugit) joins the friends, which propels Catherine into psychological breakdown.

"Queen of Earth" is a referential throwback to a myriad of feminine psychothrillers of the sixties and seventies, painted in broad streaks of Bergman and Altman, as well as making nods to obscure horror films of that era, including "Carnival of Souls" and "Let's Scare Jessica to Death." Writer/director Alex Ross Perry is clearly a student of these films, and in many ways, "Queen of Earth" seems to be a love letter to those films.

The film has a stark visual flair to it, with heavy use of closeups, continuous takes, and photography of the rural woodsy landscape, all of which accentuate atmosphere and tension. The script is thin yet rich in subtext, which provides the actors ample material to really sink their teeth into. Elisabeth Moss's performance is eerie and dynamic, while Waterston's is sincere and understated. As a meditation on the ennui and turmoil of privileged New England Generation Y-ers, the film offers little that's compelling; however, the darker visual elements and nods to the horror genre lend an absorbing and subtly creepy element that throws what could have been a tired retread of "poor little rich girl" into something far darker and nuanced. 

The conclusion is ambiguous and the lack of "resolution" will no doubt frustrate some, but the film prevails as a portrait of a psychological meltdown in the tradition of the best of them. 8/10.

A fascinating film, perhaps, for the uber elite who live in the rarefied world of privileged exceptionalism, where the life of the common person is a vague, if non-existent reality, and are instead obsessively immersed in a self absorbed universe of which they are perpetually at the center of.

As for the portrayal of such, Elisabeth Moss does convincingly deliver her character with a unique sense of familiarity.

The problem I had with this film is not the story itself, which probes into the frailties of the human condition within this rarefied social ecology, but rather with the pathetic nature of all of these nauseatingly self absorbed characters, none of whom I would ever have anything in common with, even under the most demanding of required social circumstances.

Call me a "salt of the earth" servile dolt if so inclined, if such makes you feel more self important, but what this film did do is remind me why I have specifically avoided spending any amount of time or effort becoming enmeshed in the dramatic pathologies of the supposedly social elite, which this film does deliver a compelling depiction of.

This general environment I'm quite familiar with, having had my more than my share of exposure into this sort of universe . . . and opting out of it completely.

As for the film itself as an art piece, it is an interesting voyage into the disintegrating psyche of fragile, needy people.

Deciphering exactly where the boundaries were between the actual realities of the moment, and the collage of flashbacks and self induced fantasies which would jaggedly pop in and out of the story thread was a bit exhausting at times, but overall this was a brave attempt to deliver a multi-threaded tapestry of intersecting plots which clearly would have been easily rendered in written form, but compressing such into a film would be much more demanding.

THIS is the kind of cinema that's been missing from American theaters. I saw it tonight at the Museum of Moving image and was completely engrossed. Writer Alex Ross Perry pulls off the miraculous task of making two stuck up white girls completely magnetic as you join them on an complex ride of remorse, self-reflection, and even revenge. You constantly question the characters in the film; it rubs you like a Polanski. You question reality, sanity, intentions, who's good and who's bad. Not much can be said without ruining Catherine's (Elizabeth Moss) character arc. However, it is a must see and a staple in this director's career. 

I was lucky enough to meet both Moss and Perry after the screening. To add to the successful film, they were both extremely approachable and open to conversation. Perry and I discussed tone -- he made a comment on the importance of releasing tension, specifically, the use of a cutaway to Katherine Waterston's character after a very powerful monologue delivered by Moss. He knows cinema and it shows.

Highly recommended.
