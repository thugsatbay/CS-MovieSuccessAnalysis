### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I have just watched this movie and it was a terrible disappointment. I loved other Del Toro's movies, but this ones feels totally empty. The film is a visual feast. Gorgeous locations, wonderfully lit serve as the background for the tale. Fantastic shots and good acting would make you think that this is a good movie. But it is not. The plot is so cheap, that you can tell what is going to happen since the first frame. The evil characters are so cartoonish that you can see their next movements from miles away. The "good" character is so bland and pathetic that you never have a real connection with her. In fact, as you can see where the film goes from the beginning, this movie is a total bore. Do not waste your time and watch "The Devil's Backbone" instead.

Guillermo del Toro is a director and artist whose films fall into two distinct categories: big budget English language blockbusters like "Hellboy" and "Pacific Rim" and lesser known, low budget Spanish language horror films like "Devil's Backbone" and "Pan's Labyrinth". His latest film, "Crimson Peak" is what happens when these two worlds collide, in other words, a big budget English language horror film.

"Crimson Peak" is set in the late 19th century, first in New York, then in rural England. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young budding writer who is intelligent, beautiful, and strong willed, refusing to allow Victorian sensibilities dictate what she can and cannot do, and as a result butts heads with those around her. Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) is an English aristocrat and inventor who is in New York seeking financial backing for his mechanized clay mining business back home. When tragedy strikes, Thomas marries Edith and brings her to his home, Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, where his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) is waiting. As Edith tries to fit into her new surroundings, she discovers that secrets abound and nothing is as it seems.

The visuals in "Crimson Peak" are so glorious, they are almost overwhelming. The sets are spectacular visions of beauty and decadence in decay; costumes are intricately detailed and gorgeous; the lighting and over saturated color bring depth and meaning; the ghosts are grotesquely beautiful; and, of course, the del Toro trademarks of insects and clockwork gracefully found their way into the story as well.

Because "Crimson Peak" is a rather large studio production, it is being marketed to a large audience. I believe this accounts for some of the lackluster reviews I have been reading. If one is not familiar with del Toro's prior Spanish language films, they may not understand his unique cinematic perspective. For some, this will mark the beginning of a journey into del Toro's fantasy world, for others it will be a disappointment. For me, it was almost everything I wanted it to be.

Hauntingly Beautiful Gothic Romance

Do we need another Gothic horror from Guillermo del Toro after 'The Devil's Backbone' and 'Pan's Labyrinth'? Depending on your answer to that question, you may find yourself lapping up del Toro's latest or feeling blasé about it.

Aside from the fact that there is a romance at its core, 'Crimson Peak' feels very much a mishmash of over-familiar elements from del Toro's previous films and other Victorian-era fiction, including the very well-received Showtime drama series 'Penny Dreadful'. There is a mouldering manse, an aristocratic family hiding a dark and terrible past, and last but not least a young woman who enters both family and house for the first time to discover that all is not well within its crumbling walls. Because del Toro's idea of homage to the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s is not by way of revisionism, his Gothic horror/ romance feels less refreshing than conventional  and that is especially true of its story.

Set at the turn of the last century, it tells of the American heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) who aspires to be an author in the vein of Mary Shelley, much to the chagrin of her publisher as well as her self-made industrial magnate of a father (Jim Beaver). Though her father wishes for her to marry the childhood-friend- turned-handsome-optometrist Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), Edith finds herself falling for the British baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Thomas is visiting with his older sister Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain) to seek funding from Edith's father for his 'clay harvester', though the latter rebuffs both his invention as well as his Old World status of privilege.

Del Toro, who scripted the film with veteran writer Matthew Robbins, takes his time letting Edith and Thomas fall in love with each other, but because the filmmaker is no specialist when it comes to affairs of the heart, the romance is largely stilted and bordering on cheese. It takes no less than an hour before we finally arrive at the titular haunted house, so named because the clay Thomas mines from the ground below the family property is blood-red and taints both the snow as well as the sunken floorboards. But the crimson is just one aspect of the gorgeous production design which we have come to expect no less of from the Spanish maestro; from the architecture to the stone pillars and arches to the moth-lined walls, del Toro's imagination and attention to detail is palpable in every frame.

Sans two brief sequences in which Edith's late mother returns as a black wraith with an ominous warning, the rest of the haunting takes place within the creaky, creepy confines of Allerdale Hall. Maybe it is because the recent bumper crop of haunted house movies have steeled our nerves, but horror aficionados are unlikely to find the ghostly inhabitants that del Toro conjures jolting, notwithstanding his attempt to build genuine atmosphere through a mixture of quiet anticipation and sudden sound cues. Del Toro's tendencies towards the fantastical also mean that the apparitions are less terrifying than intriguing, consisting largely of skeletal ghouls drenched in some sticky red substance.

Yet a more fundamental issue is the role that these supernatural entities play in the context of the story, which contrary to what you may expect, is much less substantial. Besides rousing Edith from her sleep in the middle of the night to lead her on a tour of the house's dark corridors and dank basement, these ghosts of Thomas' past are no more than sideshows to the central plot that has something to do with the sizeable family fortune Edith has been bequeathed following the sudden death of her father which Thomas and/or Lucille may have something to do with (and you probably already know the answer to that). Though it may seem at first that these spirits are trying to protect Edith, that assumption is pretty much laid to rest by the time Edith is in real peril, with the actual danger being (shall we say) more earthly.

That shouldn't come as a surprise to those familiar with del Toro's works. If there is one thing we've learnt, it is that ghosts exist due to attachment to place or emotion, and while frightening in and of themselves, are really not the evil we should be afraid so; instead, what we should be afraid of is the evil which exists in the heart of man, be it greed, lust or envy, each one of which Edith comes to discover within the human companions in the haunted mansion. As admirable a philosophy that may be, it does mean that the story unfolds in largely predictable fashion, which isn't helped by a dearth of any supernatural presence in the third and final act.

Indeed, there is no shaking off the feeling that there is something awfully generic about the story as well as the characters. In fact, the same can be said of most of the elements of 'Crimson Peak', which like we said at the start, seems as if it were cobbled from tropes and clichés of the Gothic horror romance genre  and the fact that del Toro has put them to more effective service in his earlier films doesn't help. The style is quintessential del Toro, lush and sumptuous in both mood and visuals, but there is something hollow about the substance within. Depending on how much you like a retread over familiar territory, you'll either love his latest or find it just a tad underwhelming.

I only saw this film because I am a del Toro fan--Pan's Labyrinth is my favorite movie. While Crimson Peak does not come anywhere near the quality of Labyrinth in terms of the script, it still showcases del Toro's unique skill for beauty and suspense.

The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are sumptuous in that signature del Toro way. The luxurious train on the heroine's robe that audibly thumps behind her as she sweeps down the staircase? Yes, please. There is a nod to all the images our minds ever conjured while reading fairy tales. The rich colors, the music, the textures all help draw us in to this world and settle us in for the story.

The film is not without its flaws. There are a few glaring plot contrivances that had me groaning. There is a superficial quality to the scenes involving Thomas Sharpe's clay mining business.

I was impressed with Jessica Chastain's talent for conveying two conflicting emotions at once, all playing out on her face, reminiscent of Gillian Anderson in Bleak House.

Del Toro's movie was just like Edith's book in the film. It needed more real romance, not some weird contrived romance that never felt real at all in any facet...and just missing something despite a lot of potential. So much wasted potential.

I am very disappointed by this film. I was looking forward to something with Del Toro (as well as Hiddleston) for some time. While I'm not generally a fan of much horror I do tend to like Gothic romance. I feel that this story started out delivering all of that.

I love the cinematography, the staging, and the costumes. Everything was gloriously detailed and lovely. I really enjoyed the amount of effort that went into the pictures as they were made. Sadly, the plot starts wonderfully and is even a bit surprising but then it falls flat and doesn't get up again. I'm not sure if parts were just a result of poor editing, or if it was planned to become dull after the trio move to England.

The opening was really inviting, there was a lot of promise in the plot. Some of the hints for the future were a little obvious in my opinion but others were less so. I feel like the director must have been trying to insult people that like romance because there was incredibly little. There were a few lines that didn't feel all that romantic and instead felt a little more like bad smut novel lines. 

Once you get to England and the haunted house things just get weird. Half the time no one is around as Edith wanders about discovering all the murders that the siblings were up to. Edith is almost always left to her own devices while Thomas works on his red clay machine and his sister...plays the piano and I dunno...sharpens her knives? I guess they must have been off practicing the 'incest is best' mentality almost all of the time - to include the middle of the night. Why does she never ask her husband why he is never actually in bed with her? Is this for the same reason none of his marriages have been consummated without any questions? A tradition followed by law to this day. She just assumes all husbands don't want their wives? What? This was the first of many glaring issues.

Why is the heroine first depicted as incredibly clever, self-reliant, and capable in the first half of the film? (Before they arrive at the crumbling manor - I now take this to be a symbol for what is about to happen to the movie.) All of these aspects sort of fall apart when she ignores all manner of clues despite previously noticing small details. When she, even though she has the money, just goes along with living in the estate at all when all logic dictates to not...yeah, well there goes a reasonably intelligent main character. Damn, we had one for the first half.

Then suddenly he does have sex with her the night they're in town? Why? It was just ill-timed, forced, and awkward, not romantic. I think Del Toro just figured he'd sell the movie more if he added a bizarre Hiddleston sex scene.

From the first scene with both siblings I knew they were shagging. It's not like it's a new theme for Del Toro. He's done it before. (Hellboy 2) It was overtly predictable and boring. Which leads me to believe he must have had some pretty unhealthy thoughts about his own sister. 

Thomas as a character felt worthless. Never was I convinced he actually loved Edith, I think he just really wanted to love her and wanted her as an escape from his abusive sister. I didn't feel bad for anyone. Thomas was a coward, that was pretty obvious and clear from the get go. Edith would have been good if she hadn't suddenly turned into a retard instead of seeking real help.

The ending bothered me the most. The order of it was just all over the place. Thomas was bumbling about like the imbecile he is. He doesn't come to really mean much of anything. Edith saves herself and he just wanders in to his sister's lair. He might as well have just stabbed himself in the face and saved everyone else the trouble of his existence. His presence might have meant something if he would have walked in to declare that this wasn't okay and that he was going to let Edith go or that they'd live together or something in his crazy head BEFORE Edith had already saved herself. But since Edith had already seemingly stabbed the bitch in the heart (a lot of that pen went pretty deep) it wasn't really meaningful. That plot arrangement was just as pointless as the character, Thomas.

Then crazy sister goes on a merry chase when she's been stabbed heavily near her heart. Cause you know, she wouldn't be bleeding to death or anything...evil people don't bleed, just not totally horrible ones. Then finally Edith doesn't get any real help from Thomas' ghost other than to function as the oldest trick in the book: 'hey look over there!' before she smashes in evil sister's head. Wow really? Worst ending I've seen in a long time. If at least he would have intervened before Edith saved herself then it might have had an ounce of feeling, but this was just poorly put together. So incredibly hollow, I'm sad good acting was wasted on that.

"Crimson Peak" has much to recommend it. Its cast is spot on, its costume design and set are beautiful and spooky. The story itself doesn't really go for the cheap thrills that most horror today goes for, and I appreciate that.

Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston have a fantastic chemistry and you readily fall in love with the love story they present you, but the real jewel of the film is Jessica Chastain. As soon as she walks on screen you know something wicked this way comes. Her piercing glare and overall sense of distaste for the other characters really unease's you in the most fun way. You can see little to no sympathy in her face and you cannot wait to see just where she'll go with it.

The story starts off as pleasantly as any period piece and you wonder what the ghouls and ghosts are up to, and whether they are in cahoots with Hiddleston and Chastain. Unfortunately by the second half, the movie looses some of its spook and becomes somewhat predictable in plot, but because of this you will be able to watch it over and over again without ever really getting bored. This is because the horror isn't the selling point of the story, the heart of the characters are. And each character has more heart than they could possibly know what to do with. 

The acting is superb and although this story has been told in one way or another, you still root for a positive outcome. Guillermo del Toro creates yet another masterpiece of film. I fully enjoyed it. 8/10

Having been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro for some time now, I had expected 'Crimson Peak' to be his next great masterpiece. Although the film didn't meet my expectations, I can't say that it disappointed them either.

Near the end of the 18th century, aspiring author Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) meets a struggling inventor by the name of Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston). The two quickly fall in love and move into Sharpe's dilapidating mansion - which is also inhabited by Thomas' sister, Lucille (Chastain). Once there, Edith slowly realizes that not everything is what it seems and decides to dig deeper, in spite of the growing dangers.

First, 'Crimson Peak' is not a horror film; it is a 'gothic romance' (with some horror elements thrown into the mix). The genre hasn't been visited upon for decades, yet Del Toro does a fine job of offering his own take on it. The film also contains plenty of blood and gore - so if you don't have a stomach for that kind of stuff, your chances of finishing this film are nil (for there are far more disturbing aspects).

The story constantly switches in tone. I get that its a 'gothic romance' (two genres that can't be any further apart from each other), but it can get confusing for some people very quickly. One scene might seem like it was from a romantic period film while the next might seem like something out of a thriller! I think Del Toro and Robbins did a fine job of balancing the pacing, but they could have certainly tweaked a few things and cut the runtime down by an extra ten or fifteen minutes.

That being said, the plot is pretty straightforward - up until the last third of the film. Again, there are some disturbing details that both Edith and the audience discover. It took me some time to connect certain things, but I eventually figured out the bigger picture. Nevertheless, the very nature of this film will undoubtedly shock you - and will do it in a way that no other film released this year has.

Both Wasikowska and Hiddleston give good performances, but Chastain is the standout. Her role as a cold-hearted, manipulative aristocrat is done with sheer excellence; you can't help but suspect of her something. She allures your attention with her mysterious persona, yet you can't help but hate her for who she truly is.

Just like in any other Del Toro film, the visuals in this film are amazing. This time, instead of the visual effects (like in 'Pacific Rim'), the main focus is on the production design and costume design. Every set, prop, and article of clothing not only have their own unique design but are also very telling of a scene's or character's given mood (now that's some good attention to detail). I would honestly be shocked if this film wasn't nominated for Best Prod. Design nor Best Costume (although I also wouldn't be surprised as the Academy usually forgets about films like these).

Despite its narrative problems, 'Crimson Peak' is a grand visual experience that needs to be seen on the big screen (notwithstanding the blood and gore). Del Toro's directing has not faltered one bit, and he truly has come up with an original concept that we haven't seen in a very long time. And although I didn't completely fall in love with this film, I will say I'm glad I watched it in theatres.

My actual rating for this film is 7.5/10

What a disappointing movie. It starts promising - a few motives, characters, conflicts, sumptuous period detail (if all a little "clean" and theatrical if you know what I mean - everyone with perfect teeth and makeup and speaking like a thoughtful scriptwriter). Then gradually you realise that everything that is glaringly obvious and predictable IS actually what is happening - and its a long, painful process watching it play out just as you expect it to. There's nothing to make you go "ah! That's interesting!" whatsoever. The ghosts look incredibly CGI and therefore not scary at all, but more to the point they had absolutely no point or function - clearly just shoehorned in (perhaps after the original draft?) as a way to make it "horror" and more marketable to the teenage market. Jessica Chastain is always watchable, and the film looks pretty colourful, but that's about it.

Crimson is "of a rich deep red color inclining to purple". It's a color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure - all of which are contained in Del Toro's latest film, Crimson Peak.

Guillermo del Toro is no stranger to adding detailed elements in a film to add depth, subtle or not. In Crimson Peak, his use of color and setting accompany the characters in a dark Gothic tale of love and deceit, with a sprinkle of suspense and gore that take the viewer on an enchanting experience. 

Rich color tones stylize the film for a gritty and unique ambiance. Edith, the main heroine, lives in a world where everything is dull and dark. But her presence, however, is evident in subdued yellows, greens, and neutral colors as she stands out in the world she resides in. Her pale skin and light hair also attribute to the innocence that she attains.

The story itself takes the viewer down a dark path, following the love between two people from two different worlds. Del Toro was smart with the balance of action and build up. For just a brief time did the story feel slow, but it later facets to the build up of later scenes. 

Although this film wasn't as thrilling as I tend to prefer, it did a beautiful job of telling a dark love story that held hints of violence, making it just as enjoyable. 

I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro paid homage to some of the classics, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, and even his own Pans Labyrinth and Mama with his use of transitions, shadows, symbolism, and sound.

If you're looking for a film that is romantic with a dredge of somber, makes you uncomfortable yet hopeful, leaves you heartbroken but still enamored - all while being visually breathtaking, then Crimson Peak should be at the top of your list.

Extremely predictable movie. Literally knew what would happen in the first 15 minutes. But thought that was so obvious I'm sure it's something else. But alas no, this movie is by the book. And all the supernatural elements added absolutely nothing to the story except the running time. Every single supernatural element could have been cut from the film and the story would be unaffected. That's just bad writing in my opinion.

Mia is so one note. Very boring actress to watch, but I guess Guillermo was going for the Alice character again because really it's a copy paste job here too. One minute the character is portrayed as a feminist and a thinking woman, and the next moment she's a total idiot. 'I pretend to be an independent woman because no one asked me to the ball'. Really? Chastaine is always good. Although she's showing up everywhere these days, she owns her roles so well it's not a problem. She was fun to watch, given what she had to work with.

I just feel this film wasted Del Toro's talents. The movie is long, and only a few small times does it feel like it's dragging. Even realizing the weaknesses in the plot, the viewer is not in pain for putting up with it. That is credit to del Toro, who has always been a visual master. And here too he keeps us visually entertained.

But that is not enough. This movie is a 6 at best. Just above average. Nothing more.

I'm only guessing but it seems that movie critics are getting 1) younger and 2)less well educated than earlier generations. Certainly the hack writing in the London Evening Standard seems to qualify on both counts and reinforced my theory when she stated categorically that Crimson Peak is not based on a classic novel. Maybe not but it is definitely a rip-off of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall Of The House Of Usher, albeit del Toro allows the house itself to remain standing but does mimic Poe's classic in featuring a crumbling mansion inhabited by a brother and sister who enjoy an incestuous relationship. Even the period is close - within sixty or seventy years of Poe - so it might have been titled The Serious Tilt Of The House of Usher. Apparently it's had mixed reviews which means more or less than a percentage of critics are happy to swallow del Toro's bulls**t.

Just for the record, i'm not a fan of horror movies. The only reason i watched Crimson Peak was the director: Guillermo Del Toro. His previous movies showed that he is a genius whose mind is filled with creativity, moreover he is able to turn his visions into reality. He has a great sense to create unique worlds and his ability to balance CGI and practical effects makes these worlds more existing.

I was terrified and amazed at the same time. Visually this movie is unexceptional, i wanted to carefully examine every piece of it, but the scary theme didn't "allow" me to immerse deep in this visual beauty for too long. The tension was built up well and constant fear of the unknown was in the air all the time. Music was a very good "wingman" of the thrill and well-timed sound effects added even more to the overall experience.

Many famous trademarks of Del Toro were smuggled into the events successfully. The sets, make ups, costumes looked amazing, but (for me) the most impressing was the creative use of colours. The external and internal design of the house ensured a perfect environment for the creepy atmosphere. This atmosphere was the major element that captivated me from the beginning till the end. That thrill that carried me through the movie is hard to describe. I was under the influence of fear and anxiety, so all elements were in the right place to make your heart beat faster.

Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska were great, but Jessica Chastain was clearly the one who almost stole the whole show. Her character was cold, seductive, mysterious and scary at the same time. I couldn't even decide whether to love or hate her.

All in all, Crimson Peak is another masterpiece of Del Toro. I recommend this movie even for those who don't like horror movies, because this is one of the few that offers much more than jump scares and unimaginative stories.

Imagine a completely humourless instalment of A Series of Unfortunate Events in which a young Count Olaf seduces Violet's dim-witted older cousin and takes her to live in his haunted red paint factory. Throw in some incest and a lot of graphic violence. Or skip seeing the movie and go straight to stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.

The plot is one long cliché - lonely young woman moons over handsome mysterious stranger, moves to isolated house where terrible secrets of the past emerge to the accompaniment of loud noises, scary music and special effects. Much blood is spilled before the heroine and her rescuer emerge slightly the worse for wear but still alive. 

The setting was depressing rather than eerily atmospheric. The acting was stilted and drab, the Edwardian era costuming shiningly synthetic. The special effects seemed designed primarily to showcase the amount of money and effort put into them.

Guillermo Del Toro doesn't make terrifying ghost stories, instead creating beautiful masterpieces that unfold in what can only be described as dark fairy tales. From 'Pan's Labyrinth' to 'The Devil's Backbone', Del Toro has a fantasy for Gothic storytelling that is matched by no-one.

Crimson Peak is no exception and from its period characters to the derelict household, everything about this film screams from an era of horror that has been iconic ever since.

When brother and sister Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) and Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) arrive on US shores, they come seeking finance in a last ditch attempt for funding of Thomas' revolutionary clay mining machine. Complicating matters further is Thomas' charm with his potential investors daughter, Edith (Mia Wasikowska). Not content with an offer above any other, Thomas pursues Edith until he claims her as his wife.

Upon their return to England, Edith, now Mrs Sharpe, learns of the namesake she inherits and the curse that comes with it as they arrive in the ghastly Crimson Peak is a masterpiece to behold and is rich with Gothic detail. Del Toro may have hit his commercial peak with 'Pans Labyrinth' but what he has achieved with this movie is an oil painting that is as representative of his own work as it is of his inspiration.

It truly is a beauty to watch with every corner of Allerdale Hall gloriously detailed in rich history and colour, something that you wouldn't perhaps associate with a ghostly tale. With a resurgence in Victorian ghost stories in recent cinema, it's no surprise that 'Crimson' doesn't quite pack the punch it should in terms of scares and storytelling but then again, the modern classics of 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' that made big budget horror a box office smash, this ghost story pits itself firmly in that category of films.

The trio of leading stars are sensational and their ranks in Hollywood royalty are well earned here. Wasikowska delivers a familiar turn as the frail victim and Hiddleston's charm is on show in droves but it is Chastain whose dark cynicism casts a shadow over any sign of happiness in this tale. There's something unnerving every time she appears on screen that only adds to the drama unfolding between the web of on screen relationships.

Everything from the ghastly apparitions to the lead cast prove that horror can be as enchanting as it is haunting and for fans of Guillermo Del Toro's growing repertoire of films, will know what to expect from the start. Yet despite the predictable nature, it doesn't make the journey any less enjoyable. Each of the pacing hallways hosts a haunt that is creative to look at and further detail is hidden in the walls as the attention to detail mean a companion book is a must. Throughout the layers of this mansion lie secrets to behold and the bittersweet tale once again, that Del Toro is the author of the grandest of fairy tales.

- Excellent cinematography and costume, I was surprised this movie costs only 55m$ dollar.

- The whole movie is creepy but not many jump scares. However, for a romantic drama, this is scary enough.

- The cast is amazing, Tom H, Mia W, Jessica C all did remarkably good job.

- The sex scene is a little bit funny, silly to be more exact.

- The first part of the movie is too cheesy, but it gets more complicated and intense over time.

- Overall, this movie is OK. It's engrossing and interesting, I highly recommend it.

Crimson Peak is one of the most artistic horror movies I've seen in recent times. The movie's aristocratic splendor won my heart and is one of the main highlights of the movie. All the main characters in this movie are rich and you will realize why once the movie culminates in its climax. And then there are the ghosts. Now I have to admit that I have seen "better" ghosts in other horror movies because the ghosts in this movie look out of shape and straight out of a child's horror story book. ( Once again if you watch the movie carefully you might actually be able to infer why the ghosts in this movie look the way they do) BUT I won't deny the fact that the movie has it's spooky moments, some of which are extremely creepy. Moments like these get a horror movie going.

So watch Crimson Peak mainly for the following reasons 

(1) The spooky moments-- Not exactly the moments when you see the ghosts but the prologue to those moments are the ones to cherish.

(2) The movie's medieval Gothic architecture and the director's eye for detail that made Crimson Peak look so beautiful-- Yes, this is a ravishingly pretty horror movie. The architecture used in this movie more than makes up for all the ugly ghosts it features. If you are aspiring to be an interior decorator and want a cathedral for a home look no more beyond Crimson Peak.

3) The aristocracy-- Like I mentioned earlier there is no dearth of opulence in this movie. The costumes are amazing and there is this exquisitely glamorous feel to this horror flick.

So have a field day in the movie theater as you watch some wealthy people of the Middle Ages tackle vindictive ghosts against an immensely beautiful backdrop.

This movie is terrible. It seems like it was made for the sole purpose of being as weird and as twisted as possible. 

"You know what's dark? A guy who marries women and kills them for their money." "You know what's even darker? A guy who does all that because he's in an incestuous relationship with his older sister." 

You get the feeling early on that there's something strange between the brother and sister, and in the back of your mind, you're thinking, "I really hope this doesn't end up being one of those weird brother-sister things." And then it does. The most original twist in the movie is that you're supposed to believe that the sister has killed not only three of the brother's wives, but also one wife's child--it turns out that the child is actually the sister's and died from being malformed and sick.

Regarding the horror, this movie is not remotely scary. The visuals of the ghosts cease to be scary when the first one appears. There is so much CGI put into them that it looks overdone and super fake. Ghosts need to be done with a light touch because familiarity with monsters takes away their scariness.

As for the acting, it wasn't bad but the only one worth mentioning is Jessica Chastain, who plays Lucille Sharpe. She's really good as the creepy, twisted, and perverted older sister.

And as for the writing, I never believed that the characters Edith and Thomas were in love because the courtship part of the story seemed rushed. And the awkward and dry sex scene did nothing to convince me.

Oh, and normal people can't bleed as much as these characters did without dying. 

So, is there anything good about the movie? There a few small things:

1. Wardrobe: The filmmakers wanted Edith to stand out, not only from the villains, but also from the side characters. Edith was usually seen in bright colors and has blond hair; everyone else was in dark colors and black. 

2. Literary References: During the film, there are three references made to some of the best novelists of the 19th century: Jane Austin, Mary Shelley, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Which is strange, because writing seems to take center stage early on, and is then swept aside completely in the second act. 

3. Paranormal Theory: Early in the film, the character Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) discusses how he believes that ghosts are tied to certain places because of stone or mineral deposits in the earth. This is an actual theory in the modern ghost hunting community, but I'm not sure if they were aware of this fact in the Victorian period.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is daytime TV tripe. Don't go see it.

Not ever having seen a Gothic Horror film I went into this completely unaware of what I was letting myself in for.

It's well directed, with rich, saturated colours and amazing sets. That's what takes this from being a one rated to two.

The story is preposterous, the characters terrible, the usual annoying Brits-are-the-baddies casting.

There is a big slice of graphic violence, claims that ghosts are real, incomprehensible behaviour from otherwise level-headed characters and an over-long running time. The film started to drag from the half hour mark and never really got going properly. There are a few jump moments, most of which are broadcast long before they arrive.

All in all a tedious, bizarre film that wasted two hours of my life and £8.50 of my money.

Crimson Peak by your almighty Guillermo Del Toro - nearly 2 hours of generic Gothic drama with aristocrats (whose characters are flat and you already know who is bad and who is good), never ending US vs ENGLAND controversy and dull scare jumps which not work like AT ALL. (oh for sure there is a love story which is boredom to watch) Oh my and that man who was responsible for the Hellboy movies which was quite unique and fresh, with characters at least!. Even Blade II stands out in a good way. The only good thing about that movie was a sound of a screaming crawling creature in the mid of the film, that moment made me goosebumps! Respect to that guy who designed the sound!

p.s. And yes, thanks Konami for burying that Kojima x DelToro silent hill thing.

There nothing wrong with the acting. There nothing wrong with the cinematography. There nothing wrong with the effects. There is everything wrong about the concept.

Please don't tell me I do not understand del Toro. I understand good story telling and this is not good story telling. This could have made a good Hammer Horror revival if it didn't take itself so seriously. There is no tension and no surprises. The only horrific thing about this movie was that it got made, with a big budget behind it.! Its not the worst move I've seen but its in the top 5. I dread to think what might knock it out of the top 5! It deserves a 1 but I've given it a 2 because of a great line at the end. If it had more of those laughs it could muster being a cult movie , but quite frankly its not original enough. Crimson Peak should be renamed Crimson Weak.

Awful with a capital A. Not even a true horror flick. Chastain was great but that's about all the good I can say about this film. Hiddleston should stick to Shakespeare or Thor. I am a fan of Hiddleston but this is not a good vehicle for him. Del Toro has done much better work in the past. Hopefully, he'll come back much stronger with his next film. The suspense was predictable and boring. The cinematography was good. The sets and costuming were okay but nothing to write home about. Best spend your money elsewhere. There are lots of good movies coming. In closing take a pass on this one. Might be okay to watch on TV when it gets there but save your money for now.

I'm sorry to say this, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Nothing about it makes sense. The plot is silly, the script seems hacked together, the acting is wooden. It's not scary, it's not romantic. The FX look nice, but aren't used effectively. Same for the sets. I guess the clothes are nice. The whole movie comes across as the plot for a puzzle style video game. It was successful in giving my wife and I something talk about all night, though we had not much nice to say about it. 

It's really hard to pin point what went wrong when really nothing in the film works. I guess it's biggest flaw is that it's incredibly dull. I have no idea how a supernatural love story could be so dull. 

Before I get carried away, I must make sure I mention the one highlight. The dog. There is a papillon featured in the movie. A wonderful breed. A terrible choice for a horror movie. The dog wound up being more charismatic than the human actors. And, being such a peppy dog, it really made light of situations that I'm sure we're intended to be suspenseful.

This movie was so awful I could hardly believe my eyes. I've never written a review before, but I strongly believe that I have a responsibility toward the human kind to warn you. DON'T WASTE 2 hours of your beautiful life watching this... thing. My friend George says that this movie could be a good cult movie. Kate was apologizing all night for making us see it. Michael was laughing so hard, he was given a verbal warning. Anyway, the ghosts did not contribute anything to the plot. The characters were flat (the only thing the protagonist did was to follow sounds around). The mother was basically scaring the Dejesus of her daughter and scarred her for life (as all mothers do; so touché Del Toro... touché) for no apparent reason. She just served as a haunting spoiler alert. I cannot believe that this script was made into a movie. I am sad. SAD.

The plot telegraphed everything so you know what is going to happen way before it does happen. The character development seems interesting, for about twenty minutes... The supernatural parts are brief and rather pointless. The decor and costuming come off as of only mild interest and the house itself... more pathetic than anything else. The acting was stiff and rather lame. The villains come off as incompetent, not particularly menacing. There is a small element of steam punk to it that feels thrown in for no particular reason. The landscape around the house was not spooky at all, but rather dry and sterile. Del Toro seems to think throwing in a bunch of insects adds something. It does add something, which is to make you wish you were watching a Peter Greenaway movie for real, instead. A Stephen King TV mini series would beat this by a country mile. Save your money.

In the turn of the Twentieth Century in Buffalo, New York, the aspiring writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Edith saw the ghost of her mother that warned her to beware of Crimson Peak when she was a child and presently she is writing a ghost story. Now she is visiting a publisher that is friend of her father and she stumbles upon her childhood friend, the ophthalmologist Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), who has returned from overseas and is opening an office in the same building. Out of the blue, she meets the English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who has come to Buffalo with his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) to seek investors to his machine that operates with clay. He has a meeting with Carter Crushing and other businessmen, but Carter refuses to invest in his invention. During the night, the ghost of Edith's mother visits her and warns Edith again to beware of Crimson Peak. Soon Thomas seduces Edith and Carter hires a private detective to investigate the lives of Thomas and Lucille. A couple of days later, the detective brings a report to Carter disclosing dark secrets from the past of the siblings. Carter pays a large amount to Thomas to end his relationship with Edith but he is brutally murdered. Thomas explains to Edith his attitude and they get married and travel to England to live in his derelict mansion over a red clay mine at Allerdale Hall with Lucille. Edith starts to see a red ghost and discovers that an Italian woman has sent a letter to him. Then she becomes weak and coughs blood. What is happening to Edith and what is the mystery of Allerdale Hall and the siblings Sharpe?

"Crimson Peak" is a combination of drama and ghost story by Guillermo del Toro. The performances, direction, locations, cinematography and costumes are magnificent. The conclusion is predictable and the plot uses many clichés, but the film is highly entertaining even for those that are not fans of horror. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "A Colina Escarlate" ("The Crimson Hill")
