### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Paterson is a celebration of the small details in life. A poetic and charming love-story about a perfectly ordinary couple, living in a perfectly ordinary town. 

The town in question is Paterson, New Jersey. Home of poet William Carlos Williams, comedian Lou Costello, and one of America's largest waterfalls. The man in question, in true Jarmusch style, is also named Paterson (played with pinpoint subtly by Adam Driver). Paterson is a hard-working bus driver who quietly goes about his duties, all the while allowing the scenery and eavesdropped conversation to inspire his main passion in life; writing poetry. Meanwhile, his girlfriend and the love of his life, played without fault by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, is a stay-at-home creative. She spends her day baking imaginative cupcakes and making new curtains from scratch. The films narrative centres around a seven day week. Each day brings a new variation on the theme, and each moment a reflection on two people who wholeheartedly accept each other for who they are. 

Paterson is a quiet and contemplative film that sits perfectly in Jarmusch's repertoire. It's a film about how people choose to live their life, regardless of the necessities to work and make money. Like poetry, the words and images flow with little dramatic tension or conflict. Jarmusch explained at Cannes that he intended Paterson to be an antidote to the modern action film, and if this is the case, I'll definitely be coming back for another dose.

From reflections in a puddle, cardinals singing, waterfalls, a harlequin guitar, shadows, designer cupcakes and more, the love of a creative and happy couple spills over the small town of Paterson, New Jersey. The ordinary becomes extraordinary. Paterson, who shares his name with the community at large, is a bus driver. The daily bus route takes him through the heart of town where Paterson overhears intriguing conversations, records observations in his notebook, generates poems and opens lunchbox surprises from his lovely and artistic wife, Laura. The couple's chemistry, expressed in kisses, constant conversation, cheer and trust, is remarkable. "She understands me really well," says Paterson. Lucky guy. Lucky girl. The attractiveness, talent, color and charm of Laura and Paterson is infused in everything they do including Paterson's nightly tavern visits, the plain yet peculiar meals they have together, waking up in the morning and walking the dog.

Even in all its outward simplicity, there is astonishing and wonderful depth to the film characters, scenes, themes and conversations. This artistic sensibility that is infused in everyday life, is something I loved so much about Japan and Paterson shows what this imaginative awareness looks like in small town North America. Truly there is inspiration and beauty everywhere. While the film delves into music, paintings and other mediums, its main artistic focus is on poetry. There are nods to the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and others. The poems Paterson comes up with in his jaunts around town are brilliant and beautiful. A box of Blue tip matches inspires, rather sparks, a love poem. A poem called Another One is about seeing other dimensions, which is what this incredible film encourages itself. 

Paterson is delightfully layered with surprising wisdom, complexity, diversity and humor at every turn. Twins make appearances every so often, for example, to remind us of one of the film themes; there is always someone out there like us that matches our hearts, and we are never really alone. Articles and images on a tavern wall take us to other dimensions in time in an instant. The on-screen chemistry between actors Adam Driver (Paterson) and Golshifteh Farahani (Laura) is critical to the film, and they are more than up to the task. They are outstanding, alluring and entirely convincing. The compassion and charm of this film is unforgettable. It reminds us that love and splendor spring from the unlikeliest of places. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.

Here's the summary: A bus driver named Paterson drives a bus in a town called Paterson, NJ. He lives with a woman who doesn't work but paints black and white designs on everything that doesn't move. A week in the life of this pair runs as follows: He gets up and goes to work. Writes some poetry in a notebook. We watch as he walks to and from work. There are twins dotted all over Paterson. She buys an expensive guitar as she wants to become a country singer and she also makes cup cakes. There is a dog called Marvin. Marvin eats the poetry notebook. Paterson despondent. But then meets a Japanese man who asks him if he is a poet and gives him a new blank notebook. Closing credits. By which time the red hot pins stuck in my eyes had become permanently embedded. What sounded like clapping rose from one section of the meagre audience, except it wasn't clapping. It was a woman slapping her partner trying to wake him up.

Marvin was good.

First of all, I kindly remind IMDb users that, if you want to click on "Yes" or "No" at the bottom of this review, the question is: "Was the above review useful to you?", NOT "Do you agree with the above review?", nor "Do you agree with the rating without reading the above review?". Thank you.

Second, just to explain where I stand, I do like artistic movies, even slow ones, and even some of Jim Jarmusch's. They are offbeat, contemplative and somewhat poetic. In "Paterson", poetry is obviously his chief ambition: the main character is an amateur poet, there are talks about (more or less) famous poets and it relies on "everyday poetry", if this makes sense.

- One poetic component is repetition: the main character has the same name as the city he lives in; we see many twins (thus a "double repetition"); events occur repeatedly; there are a few correspondences (for instance Laura has the same name as Petrarch's muse); the camera focuses on leitmotifs (watch, cereals, lunchbox, mailbox, beer glass, etc.). All this creates "internal rhymes" that, interestingly, are missing from Paterson's poems. What about these poems, by the way? They are sort of nice in their genre, however do we really need to hear them two or three times each, and see them written on top of that? It would have required an outstanding style, which I think is lacking.

- Another poetic ingredient is oddity: strange elements slowly spill into an otherwise ordinary life.The black and white motifs created by Laura progressively invade the house: curtains, painting, carpets, clothing, and even the spare wheel cover of their car. When Paterson and Laura go to the cinema, they watch a horror movie which is, echoing Laura's motifs, in black and white (an additional correspondence). Small objects have a magical touch, notably the matchbox. Everett draws a gun in the bar. There are uncommon encounters, for instance the young poetess, the separating couple and the Japanese tourist. Entertaining, in a way.

- Another phenomenon is the "enchanted bubble" sensation. It is a happy life: Paterson and Laura have a relatively easy time (although he seems on the edge, yet nothing wrong happens); they love each other; everybody is friendly; it is always sunny. There are no news from the outside world. The couple is isolated from family, real friends and neighbours, if any; they have no TV, no computer; he has no mobile phone. The rare issues are trifle: gang youngsters in a convertible just provide a fair warning; the Indian driver's problems are not so dramatic (especially considering how he describes them); Everett's gun is fake; the bus breaks down without consequences. The only drama is the loss of the secret book, however Paterson continues to write on another notebook given by Providence. Moreover, it is comforting to see hidden talents behind apparently simple personalities (writing, cooking, decorating, chess, etc.): it demonstrates we all have something to express.

- Last, there is some form of humour, notably with the above-mentioned invasive motifs, the grumpy dog and the contrast between Paterson and Laura. She is enthusiastic, eccentric, willing to try all sorts of activities; she dreams of fame and actually is rather talented. He is reserved, quiet, slightly puzzled by her; he just wants a peaceful life and is talented as well, as a writer. She always is onto something new (and sometimes weird) while he is stuck in routine. Amusing, to an extent.

And then? Well, that's about it. The movie mainly relies on these bits and pieces. It is enough for a short film, however here it drags on for almost two hours. In the end, the ensemble feels somewhat pointless: this is partly intentional, of course, but it did limit my appreciation.

So what is missing? Probably, "Paterson" does not go far enough in its ambition. For instance, the bizarre touch could have been pushed further, to explore a different dimension. Or the humour. Or the elaboration of a stronger poetic structure. Or a progression of some sort. Or the inclusion of themes, adding depth and triggering another emotion than just having a pleasant time.

I cannot rate the movie lower than 5/10 because it is not terrible. There are a few interesting ideas, characters are likable, it is laid back, it changes form the standard blockbuster. Yet I cannot rate it higher because it did not appeal to me: it doesn't have much substance, doesn't evolve and doesn't provide a lasting impression, unlike exceptional films that linger in the mind for days. Not bad, not great, just in the middle. Half-baked.

But then, appreciating poetry is very subjective. Hence it is understandable some persons find the movie captivating and rate it 10/10 (which is easier to defend than the same rating for "Police Academy 6"). On the other hand, it also is understandable persons find it utterly boring and rate it 1/10 (which is easier to defend than the same rating for "Citizen Kane"). Question of personal sensitivity to this style.

"Paterson" tries to illustrate James Tate's brilliant quote: "Poetry is everywhere; it just needs editing." Unfortunately, I missed the editing part. Maybe I am narrow-minded.

I'm not sure if Jim Jarmusch ("Only Lovers Left Alive") in Paterson wants to make America great again by giving us his vision of the way it used to be, or is telling us that we only have to look around us to discover that it's great right now. Performed by a brilliantly authentic Adam Driver ("Midnight Special"), Paterson is not only the name of the city in New Jersey known for its resident poet William Carlos Williams, but is also his name. He is a poet whose Haiku-like verses (actually written by Ron Padgett) are reminiscent of the city's own poet William Carlos Williams. He writes a new poem every day (or finishes an old one) on the #23 bus he drives before and during his trip. Though his loving, energetic, somewhat scattered wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani, "Finding Altamira") keeps asking him to make copies of them, he resists the idea, preferring to keep them in his secret notebook.

The film has little conflict, family dysfunction, or mental health issues. It is about what works and even (wonder of wonders) about a marriage that is not falling apart. Like most people with jobs and families, Paterson has a daily routine. There's too much variation in his day to call it a takeoff on Groundhog Day, but it does have that "same old, same old" quality. He awakes shortly after 6am, has a bowl of cereal that looks suspiciously like Cheerios, walks to his job driving the #23 bus through the streets of Paterson, listening in on conversations (often with a broad smile on his face) of passengers who talk about anything from Italian anarchists to boxer Hurricane Carter and comedian Lou Costello.

He comes home at six, corrects a leaning mailbox that moves daily thanks to his grumpy English bulldog Marvin (RIP), has dinner (some on the exotic side) talks with Laura who fills him in on the many projects she has going on including painting black and white circles on draperies, learning to play the guitar, and making cupcakes to sell at the local farmers market. He then takes Marvin for a walk and goes for a beer at the local pub where he chats with the owner Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley, "Carrie"), and often acts as a moderator between Everett (William Jackson Harper, "True Story"), a dramatic actor who desperately wants to reunite with his ex-wife Maria (Chasten Harmon.

The poems that Paterson reads as the words are flashed on the screen are not about odes to nightingales (though there's nothing wrong with that) but about down-to-earth things, such as one about matches, inspired by Ohio Blue Tip matchboxes that have disappeared from our lives. In "The Run," he says, "I go through trillions of molecules that move aside to make way for me while on both sides trillions more stay where they are. The windshield wiper blade starts to squeak. The rain has stopped. I stop. On the corner a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand." In other poems he lets the world know how much he is in love with his wife, though he confides in us that he occasionally looks at other woman, something which as far as I know is still legal.

To Paterson, a poem should be simple and direct and he is moved by one such poem by a 9-year-old girl who recites it to him while she is waiting for her mother and sister. He complements her on her poem about a waterfall, remembering a few lines and reciting them to Laura when he gets home. Contrary to most films where, except for films about wealthy financial elites, work does not play a big role in the life of the characters, Paterson makes real what daily living is about for a majority of working people. The film has warmth and humor wrapped in a portrait of a city which has seen better days, a city in which Jarmusch creates a structure of closely observed small moments revealed with empathy.

Paterson is a man who is not looking for life to give him satisfaction but who brings satisfaction to it, a man who knows that satisfaction does not depend on accumulating things but in being grounded in who you are and what you can bring to the world. He comes to appreciate that poetry is not extraneous to life but that life itself is poetry. Although the film presents an idealistic picture of a city without visible slums, drugs, and crime which we know exists, Jarmusch may be providing us with a welcome counterpoint, showing us the way our cities should be and can be again.

I owe Jarmusch a debt of gratitude for being a formative figure in shaping my cinematic tastes. I shall never forget watching Stranger Than Paradise (1984) in NY in the early 1980s: the novelty, joy, patient camera movement, the fantastic way of playing Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'I Put a Spell on You' throughout the soundtrack. I have seen most of Jarmusch's movies ever since and more than three decades later, Paterson did not disappoint. Jarmusch is as creative as ever, gifting us with a wonderful film. The set is Paterson N.J., the protagonists are a bus driver also named Patterson and his artistically creative spouse. Paterson writes poetry, reads poetry, and encounters poetry wherever he goes and whoever he meets. This is it. And it is as engaging, uplifting, funny, and as insightful as a film can be. Patterson may be watched as a homage. It delicately portrays a particular place, Paterson New Jersey, reminding us that a place, any place, is always a product of the way its present mixes up with its past, of the way people both walk it and remember it. But the film is not only a homage to a place, it is also a homage to daily life, to the mundanity of just going to work and having a drink after a day's work. One striking feature of this film is that there are no bad characters here, no evil spirits, no mean intentions. In fact the only mean character in the film is the protagonists' dog, but even the dog is not too bad, just a drag. And miraculously, in spite of this, the film is totality innocent of naiveté. As if at the hands of a gifted anthropologist, the camera curiously follows and watches, and the film never falls into anything resembling judgment and condescension. It is truly genius in its ability to draw us into the perspective of the protagonists, to embrace their feelings and movements, to empathize with them and to fall in love with their numerous small encounters. Remarkably, one of the achievements here is that the film feels and looks timeless. It could be shot in the 1950s, or the 1970s, and yet it makes no attempt to hide the fact that it has been shot only recently. Incidentally, Paterson makes a point about not having a mobile phone. It does wonders to the film and its ability to give homage. A truly uplifting film.

Jim Jarmusch films can be challenging and Paterson (2016) is no exception. Audiences who are accustomed to plot or character-driven stories will find themselves grappling instead with a mood in search of a reason. Without a genre label to help, we must work through an exploratory essay into the ordinariness of human existence elevated occasionally by the creative impulse to write poetry. If it sounds cerebral, then it's a Jarmusch film. Paterson (Adam Driver) is a bus driver in Paterson, USA. If that sounds odd, then it matches this whimsical story based on the typical week of a nondescript transport worker who lives not a life but a routine. His unchanging beige existence is in bold relief to his beautiful Iranian-born wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) who is artistically creative and continually reshaping her goals. Their lovable and irascible bulldog Marvin is the story's primary source of humour. Paterson drifts into writing poems throughout his day, composing lines in his head, and sometimes his silken words appear as on-screen text framed by banality like an urban bus window. His free-flowing verses are a contrast to his symmetrical and ordered life. While Laura thinks they should be shared with the world, he is bashful about them because the sentences do not rhyme. The pattern of his days is always the same, punctuated by what happens to others rather than what happens to him. Quirky characters create capsule sketches that represent the mundanity of living: a woe-riddled supervisor, a broken romance, a curious Japanese tourist, overheard passenger conversations, and a broken down bus  all part of a quiet existential stream notable only for its inconsequence. Narrative turning points work like signposts that tell us that something significant is about to occur in a story, but there are none here. Each time it appears possible that the story might progress in some interesting new direction nothing happens, perhaps to reflect how Paterson lives his life. There are layers of unreality across many scenes and the dialogue often feels as if it is being delivered at a script reading: clear diction, perfect rhythm, without emotion. This slight air of inauthenticity forms a backdrop for the sincerity and lyricism present in Paterson's poetry. It may or may not be good poetry; that is not the point. It is about contrasting layers of reality and they are evident elsewhere, always with the same effect. When a small girl who also writes poetry says "Cool. My bus driver is a poet" we feel like responding: "well, why not?"; creativity hides everywhere. Not everyone will stay with this film because of its minimalist pace, deadpan humour, prolonged silences, understated acting and noticeably sparse music to lift the emotional tone. It is devoid of regular cinematic artifice and feels like we have momentarily glimpsed into the inner space of a true gentle soul and can walk away the better for it. Author: cinemusefilms.com

It's not so easy to say what 'Paterson' is about. It's about a week in the life of a bus driver - that's the easy answer. A week in which not much happens, by the way. But it's also about poetry: the bus driver writes poems while waiting behind the wheel. It's about happiness: the film is drenched in it. And about simplicity: the bus driver's life is extremely simple. He wakes up at about quarter past six, kisses his sleeping wife, eats a cereal breakfast, walks to the bus garage, drives his bus, and returns home to the evening meal his wife has prepared for him.

Jim Jarmusch shows this seven times: once for each day in the week. But there are slight differences: sometimes he wakes up at half pas six, his wife's position in bed is different each day (once she's not there because she got up before him), the talk at dinner depends on the events of the day. And small things happen every day: there's an incident at the local pub, the bus breaks down, his wife sells cupcakes at the farmer's market.

When the average Hollywood blockbuster is a roller-coaster ride, this film is a quiet walk in the woods. Some people may find it boring. I didn't. 'Paterson' is a special film, because it has a very rare characteristic: it's not about anything in particular. Or is it about life itself? It's up to the viewer to decide.

I really felt that although folks mostly agreed that the movie captured the "poetry of everyday life", there was much more to be had from the movie, which has it subtleties aplenty. Yes the ruins of Paterson are beautiful, yes the dappling of the light is fine, yes Laura and Paterson are a beautiful couple but go deeper!

Most art that you initially create is going to be derivative. Paterson's poetry is essentially derivative of William Carlos Williams. You have to fight through this phase and find your own creations. So when Paterson's homework is eaten by the dog (remember to see the humour in this), I was mindful that the dog had done him a favour, because all of the early stuff is worthless, unless you happened to be called Rimbaud or Chatterton, and even then I imagine they burned a lot of doggerel before they wrote a good sentence. Derivation can be incredibly apparent in painting, for example Mondrian, where he dabbled with other folks' styles (impressionism, fauvism and even pointillism) before he arrived at his unique mature expression, for which he is famous (termed neoplasticism).

Writing poetry is difficult, as so eloquently pointed out by WB Yeats:

"We sat together at one summer's end,// That beautiful mild woman, your close friend, // And you and I, and talked of poetry.// I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;// Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought, // Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.// Better go down upon your marrow-bones // And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones // Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather; // For to articulate sweet sounds together// Is to work harder than all these"

Paterson will need to break a lot of patterns and cobwebs if he wants to become a great poet.

Many have looked at this portrait of a relationship and saw something sweet and tender. I'm sorry but I saw two disconnected individuals, a freeloading girlfriend, a boyfriend without a backbone, and a couple that didn't make decisions together. They're both good-looking tranquil people, but they're not soulmates. Laura tells Paterson that his poetry is great, but he needs challenge, not a sycophant, he needs someone who understands him, not someone who uses his wages to buy an expensive dog and gets him to walk it every evening! So when he recites a love poem, it's something false, it's a confection, it's what we want to hear but it's not true, and this is why he's still so far from greatness.

The use of doubles in the movie is far from trivial, what it's saying is that there is a different lives Paterson (or any of us) could be leading, we have to make choices every day about which person we are going to be. The dissolve at the end when Paterson is lying in bed and seems to disappear momentarily is hinting that he might be best off disavowing his current life, he should be running a mile. Yet it's a comfortable life, and everyone likes comfy right? Two guys on the bus have a discussion where both recall recent encounters with women they liked and both had managed to fumble the ball through inaction, they chose, they don't live uncomfortable lives, but they chose not to live passionate lives. So that's why I chose the title for the review, because we all have to decide whether to embrace nonbeing, some sort of Taoist concept of naturalness, or whether we want to bristle our creativity, and streak like comets. Maybe the latter is innately egotistical. I think that the choice is what this movie is about, be humble or be brave. The movie is dualistic, no one interpretation is there to be forced on you. For me when he writes a poem about the song "Swinging on a Star" that's saying something key, he mentions that the only line he really plays again in his head is the one about being a fish, not being any of the others lives in the song. Again this is dualistic because it could be saying that he knows the life of a poet is for him, and it's the only one he thinks about, so he should embrace it, but if you read the full lyrics of the song, it talks about the fish who "can't write his name or read a book". Whereas another option "Would you like to swing on a star // Carry moonbeams home in a jar // And be better off than you are". Seems like the best though radical option that is open to Paterson, to change everything, but perhaps he won't take it.

Ending on a more playful note, congratulations to Mr Jarmusch for yet again working a matchbox into proceedings!

Saw Paterson at the Vancouver Film Festival today and enjoyed to a certain point, while becoming a bit tired of some of its cuter elements (such as the bus driver poet's decorating girlfriend) and the modernist or minimalist pace, which grows contrived in the repetition of both routine days and quirky features. The film is a tribute to Paterson, NJ's famous poet, William Carlos Williams and to the notion of celebrating reality by recording it in a faithful, painterly fashion without embellishment or sermonizing.

If you don't demand a lot of action or forward motion you are more likely to enjoy this film as a kind of modernist poem in itself. You have a cute grumpy dog to entertain you, an idealized love relationship to wonder about, and some complete red herrings such as omnipresent twins to distract you from the static still-life character of the film.

Greetings again from the darkness. Do you find poetry in everyday life? What about poets  do you envision loners whose lives are filled with angst and suffering? Our lead character here is a pretty normal guy who drives a city bus, has a happy marriage, and walks his dog each evening. He's also a poet  and a pretty interesting one.

Writer/director Jim Jarmusch (Broken Flowers, 2005) often seems like he is making films for his circle of friends  all whom must be much cooler than you and me. This time, however, he takes an opposite approach and brilliantly focuses on a dude that any of us could know. Paterson (Adam Driver) is a New Jersey Transit bus driver who writes poetry based on his observations of life's seemingly minor details (his first poem notes "We have plenty of matches in our house").

You should be forewarned: there are no murders, kidnappings, bank robberies or shootouts. Things move rather deliberately. Also missing are any special effects  heck, Adam Driver even got licensed to drive a bus for the role. Instead, we are forced to slow down and see each of the seven days of a week through the eyes and words of Paterson. He observes. He listens. He people watches. He then commits his thoughts to the page and recites them for our benefit. Sometimes he is eavesdropping on bus passengers, while other times he curiously tries to figure out the newest "dream" for his beloved wife Laura (Golshifteh Farahani). Having the soul of an artist, Laura cloaks her world in a geometric black and white color scheme while energetically bounding from cupcakes to country and western music to cooking as she pursues her place in life.

There are many Jarmusch touches throughout. Paterson the poet actually lives and works in Paterson, New Jersey  yep, Paterson from Paterson. The interactions at the neighborhood bar (run by Barry Shabaka Henley) are simultaneously real and surreal  right down to the wall of local fame (including Hurricane Carter and Lou Costello, but no mention of Larry Doby). Coincidences abound. A young girl recites her poem to Paterson  her writing style, personal book, and delivery make her seem like his poetic doppelganger  all while the recurring appearance of numerous sets of twins make us believe in the law of attraction. Lastly, the closest thing to a villain in the film is Paterson's bulldog Marvin, in what plays like a love-hate relationship with the mailbox being center-ring.

Another local Paterson (the city) aspect is Paterson's (the poet) admiration of the works of William Carlos Williams, a poet whose style he emulates. One of the terrific scenes near the end involves a spontaneous interaction between Paterson and town visitor (Masatoshi Nagase) that takes place next to The Great Falls, and serves as a reminder that we should accept who we are, no matter the challenges or lack of glory. This is truly director Jarmusch's ode to the artist/poet in each of us and in ordinary life. Creating art as best we can is a very personal thing, and for some it's a need - while for others it's one of life's simple pleasures. Regardless, a "normal" life with daily routines is not to be scorned, but rather embraced, should you be so fortunate. If you doubt this, Paterson asks, "Would you rather be a fish?" **NOTE: sharp moviegoer eyes will recognize Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman, who both had their debut in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (2012).

PATERSON is the best Jim Jarmusch movie for years, possibly his best ever. To his admirers, it will come as a welcome relief after the dreariness of his previous film, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE.

The eponymous Paterson is, at the same time, a laconic bus driver, the New Jersey city through which he steers his bus, and the epic poem by William Carlos Williams set in the city. By the simple, brilliant expedient of making his bus driver a poet, Jarmusch delivers a kind of continuous triple-exposure: all three Patersons are on the go throughout the film. This enables apparently random episodes, such as conversations which Paterson the driver eavesdrops upon while driving his route, to be integrated perfectly into the structure of the film. Everything feels connected in a remarkable way.

That this never comes over as an intellectual idea, but instead as a story full of humanity and compassion, is largely down to the casting of Adam Driver as - yes, probably another wry Jarmusch gag - the driver. Observant, thoughtful, loving, tender, but also strong and capable of decisive action in what appears to be an emergency, Driver's gives a performance that is both a contradiction of what we think of as acting and its apotheosis. It's completely brilliant, beyond mere praise. There isn't an award for something like this, but if there were, Driver would walk away with it.

The supporting cast are all fine and dandy, notably Golshifteh Farahani as Paterson's lover, and the late, great Nellie as her bulldog.

The film is mercifully free from conventional plotting. When a little moment of it pops up, you can see the turn of events coming quite a way off, but it's hardly a flaw.

There's no way this can not be worthy of 10 out of 10, because it's a great movie by a great filmmaker at the top of his game.

Instead of waterboarding and other "benign" types of torture, black-ops people should use films like Paterson to try and extract information from dangerous criminals.

The film is so devoid of anything that after watching it for more than 30 minutes even the most hardened criminals will be clamoring to confess anything.

The emptiness of Paterson is like a mental black hole that sucks anything we have in our heads. It is like a sponge that absorbs any thoughts, creative ideas we may try to process while watching it.

It is dull, slow, amorphous, insipid and as ugly as the main star in the film ( a bulldog....)

Paterson is another one for the artsy-fartsy crowd.

Appalling. This film disgusted and angered in equal measure. Come on! Please! What the hell was going on? I thought for several moments that Paterson's entire friend group were imaginary, predictions I made would have made for a better screenplay. Sorry, but this was just a total waste of time.

As for Adam Driver - this actor has one single expression that he maintains consistently throughout the entire film. The best thing about the film was the superbly beautiful actress Golshifteh Farahani, who did a decent job of playing a moronic character obsessed with boring artwork. Farahani's art and Driver's poetry was so terrible that it was laughable, was that the joke? 

You don't have to be a great artist or painter to enjoy life every day - I suppose that's what the film is about - but seriously, I could film myself doodling on a notepad and create something more interesting.

Garbage. 1 out of 10

Jim Jarmusch's films often create witty, thought-provoking dialogue with odd characters to captivate the viewer. Paterson, however, is ordinary in every way.

Paterson focuses on the ordinary, meaningless tasks of everyday life and the audience waits patiently for something to happen. It becomes painfully obvious that the overall point is in the "beauty" of seemingly ordinary instances and observations. The main flaw is this: we experience this every day and it is completely paradoxical to watch a movie based on this concept when we see these events daily. It reminds me of having to watch Groundhog Day without the protagonist growing beyond the first day. 

Jarmusch's direction does not help or hinder the film, but the writing severely lacks any passion at all whatsoever. This seems intentional, but the actors painfully deliver awkward lines that do not reflect natural conversations. It actually felt like many of them were reading the script for the first time while they were on screen. Due to this, the movie pitifully plods along predictably and ends with a mild artistic, predictable message as well. 

What Jim Jarmusch accomplished with Coffee and Cigarettes and Stranger Than Paradise was impressive, but this takes many, many steps back and will be forgotten by the time I watch another movie.

The first movie I watched this year and I am afraid it will set the bar too high for me. Paterson is a movie about art, inspiration, love, humor, struggle, loss and hope, pieced together with ... poetry. It is a movie about what it means to be an artist in the modern world, in our world.

The movie captures the spontaneity, normality and routine of life and it is not trying to be grandiose nor boring, on the contrary it is honest, personal, intimate and touching. Every scene, every frame, every line of dialogue, every melody was arranged to make you feel that way, elegantly packed, just like a poem.

I don't want to tell you about the story and I don't want you to read about it, if you like poetry, if you enjoy art and interested in witnessing an instance of it being shaped in front of your eyes, then go watch the movie, when you will leave the theater you will be different from the person who entered.

This has got to be the most uneventful, boring film I have seen in a while. There are some interesting characters and Adam Driver is good, but the story is just about as dull as watching paint dry. Maybe I am missing the point or this is supposed to have hidden meaning and make a statement, but all I can say is that statement was lost in the dull dialogue and non- event events. I was left wondering what was the point of the film other then to highlight the mundane existence of some people. The problem is that I cannot see this as a normal life without the character getting put on medication for depression.

After Rogue One, I was expecting much more from Driver. Do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD on this one, if you must see it at all. I wish I could get the time back that I wasted watching this snooze fest.

I cannot begin to understand why this film is considered so good. But then again, I don't understand why the things he writes are considered poetry, so it must have something to do with that. It's a boring character, in a boring town, married to a crazy person, who owns a dog that he hates and drives a bus. NOTHING HAPPENS. I've seen reviews that say the "beauty is in the details". Maybe. But it's a very deeply boring and annoying film for those of us who are not fans of poetry for the sake of poetry. I like slow films, I like old films, I enjoy independent films very much and I like a certain kind of poetry (classical to be specific). But I don't like a film without an argument, no matter how many nice frames there are in it, just like I don't like a poem without rhyme. If you're anything like me, don't watch it. If you completely disagree with me, then you're going to love it!

Paterson lives a perfect life of an artist - it's timeless, it's romantic, it's poetic. It is not "objective reality" that an uneventful life of a bus driver in a small town can present: a gray boring suburban town where even crimes never turn out real, a simple monotonous, low-paid job, family or health problems that others can experience. It is not Paterson's reality, he chooses a different life.

Everyday he wakes up (not because alarm wakes him) to kiss a perfectly beautiful woman who tells him a wonderful dream. Artistic herself, she is a perfect muse for an artist, with exotic looks and foreign accent. She shapes their surroundings where everything matches in color and pattern: his clothes, bed sheets, even matches. Even words match all the time. The box he carries everyday contains lunch she prepared for him and a photo of hers that is different everyday. She is caring, loving, and supportive; her only concern is preservation of his poetry. Her only flaw, perhaps, was a surprise pie she made with cheese and brussels sprouts. 

Everyday as he goes to work, he enjoys a picturesque view. And every morning before driving his bus he writes poems in his secret notebook. He enjoys driving a bus because he can listen to people's conversations. He is not concerned about money, and chooses not to have a smartphone because he doesn't want to, not because it's expensive. Unlike his coworker, he has nothing to complain about. 

The only cause of Paterson's problems is his wife's dog. Everyday day it bends over Paterson's mail box stand, for example, with an attempt to annoy him. But he is patient and even manages to make his evening walk with the dog enjoyable as he can drop into a bar for a beer. The dog, however, is the real danger that can shatter his ideal life, at the core of which is poetry. 

If he meets another girl, it would be a 10 year old one who writes her own poetry. If he witnesses a crime about to happen, the reason would be unrequited love, and the gun would be a toy one. And if something happens to his secret notebook, he would meet a stranger who would appear out of nowhere and sit on the same bench, where Patterson would sit. And the stranger from a faraway land would happen to love poetry too, and he would happen to have a bag full of poetry notebooks. And, of course, he would give Patterson a new notebook as a gift which would inspire him to write again. And everything will be fine, forever. 

Because it's a beautiful world, in which a bus driver likes Emily Dickinson.

I really wanted to like this film. The trailer looked interesting but it was just awful. Like a few others that have reviewed it, it really was like Groundhog Day. I usually like a character study or relationship study in a film but this one just had no point and no plot. Bus driver who writes poetry with quirky girlfriend who paints weird designs on everything she sees. And lots of shots of Paterson, New Jersey. That's the movie. Adam Driver does a good job with the script he was given. I thought it might be a little like Garden State (actually Driver reminds me a little like Zach Braff). Very disappointed. Had high hopes.

I wish someone had warned me about how painfully slow and quiet this wretch of a movie is before I decided to see it in the theater. I can appreciate that the filmmaker was trying to be artistic, but so much of the film relied on images of people sleeping or sitting or on the never- ending rambling of awful poetry being recited, and those long, uneventful moments made for an extremely tense and awkward movie theater experience. Sitting in the cramped quiet listening to my neighbors cough and praying for some on screen action made for a very regrettable two hours of my life, and effectively killed any meaning this story might have been trying to provoke. The characters in the film were likable enough, but the majority of comic relief came from spontaneous shots of the family's dog being adorable. By the end of the movie, I wanted to punch each of the characters in the face, except for Jared Gilman's, who is far too talented to be relinquished to an unnamed part in a lifeless film. If you have to see this movie, rent it On Demand and have it playing in the background while you do something more productive.

I liked both main actors including the dog and I tried to like the movie but it was going nowhere. By Wednesday I got the story-line but didn't stay through Saturday. I usually enjoy stories that build relationships but could find it in this one. Sadly, I had to leave before Sunday. I hope I didn't miss anything significant.

As with Manchester by the Sea, this was another long anticipated movie on my watchlist to see. And yet again, as with Manchester by the Sea, my excitement turned to disappointment as I struggled to keep my eyes open and from nodding off to sleep.

Adam Driver has a spot in my heart and I believe he is a strong up and coming actor; one to keep a close eye on. With that said, I am not sure why he was cast in this role. His character makes for a very unlikely match in every way, shape, and form. However, his was the strongest performance, which was far from his best. The rest of the acting was absolutely criminal.

I am still struggling with the 1 hour 57 minutes of my life I will never get back, along with the fact that I am starting to lose trust in my fellow IMDb reviewers that gave this film an average of 7.7 when this flick should have barely been able to climb to a 6.

Perhaps if you are an artsy fartsy person who is big into poetry, and BAD poetry at that, or perhaps you are a native to Paterson and want to watch it for posterity, then this flick just might be for you. As for the rest of us, our time would be better spent walking our dogs, making cupcakes, having a beer, etc etc etc...

Don't let me misguide you - this is not a controversial movie, this is a slow paced film about the small things in life which make us happy. And which we miss all the time...

So, yes - Adam Driver - he is the movie, no doubt about that. Just check his non profit organization (http://www.aitaf.org) and you will see that he really was "the one" for this role. And his picture in the marine corp suit in the movie is a real one. This also leads us to get the impression that he (as a quiet poet, driving every day a bus in a smaller city named the same as his character) is the centerpiece on the film. Yes, but to some extent. I think that the real main character of this beautiful art piece is the mundane life itself. With every good and bad thing about it. I also need to favor the supporting cast - from Golshifteh Farahani (what a name!) to all the twins seen in this movie - everybody plays exceptionally well. I just didn't get the Everett role - maybe because it seemed like a piece from a stage acting class done as a separate enclave in this movie. I understand the purpose of the whole Marie and Everett vehicle, but it still seemed a bit odd and off for me. Other than that - the ensemble of actors is really great. And the city of Paterson - I wonder if Jim Jarmush's whole idea was to create this film as an ode to this city. Probably yes! And it sounds pretty romantic (given the circumstances) to a 30-year old male from Bulgaria, thousand of miles far away from this location. So the whole background story of the city itself clicks pretty well for the viewer I think.

The music is a bit strong at times but generally favors the situations and emotions and compliments them. 

This is a very ordinary story and at the same time it creates extraordinary feelings in the viewer - that we must enjoy our lives as they are, not necessary as we want to think they are. Love, compassion, romanticism, calmness, diversity - every word fits well for this film. I enjoyed it quietly, calmly and respectfully. It is a movie for the lovebirds for the families, for the local communities, it is a movie for every one.

So, although it might seem slow and that nothing ever will happen in it - great things appear under the surface of this motion picture. Humanity itself is peeking out from Paterson's character. Mundane, yet full of creative energy, ready to burst from the screen.

Please support this movie, so that others like it are made more often!

Paterson (Adam Driver) is a bus driver in, coincidentally, Paterson, New Jersey. He lives in a humble home with his girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and they are happily in love with each other and their dog. Paterson also happens to write poetry routinely as he goes around town in his bus and experiences everyday life.

As anyone who has heard of this film you will probably know that there is no hook in the synopsis, no inciting incident, "Paterson" is a film that looks at routine and ordinariness and succeeds in that is is a, fittingly, poetic look at the joys of simplicity and tranquility and a wonderfully absorbing filmmaking effort that is most unlikely to any other film I've seen this year.

Having been a big, big critic of Adam Driver in the past, more so because I thought he was constantly miscast I was so pleasantly surprised by a performance of him that I could finally appreciate and what a performance to start with. A lot of this film's success lies in his hands, I can only imagine what an effort it must have taken Jarmusch to direct him in the perfect way, to put into words what ultimately he envisioned on screen. Yet, the effort must have been worth it because Driver comes out utterly convincing. This is a performance of nuances, of little details, of eyes wandering in one direction rather than the other and of postures, he covers it all and becomes this quirky character, he sells the idea of an every-man perfectly and because of that it makes the film as relatable as it is.

His co-star, Golshifteh Farahani, walks the same line just as finely. Her character is very extrovert, a perfect opposite of what Driver is, and she plays off him magnificently. It could be very easy for her to become a stereotype, a cliché and an annoying presence in the film, she has all the ingredients to be so, but by playing the part so genuinely and lovingly we get a character that is sweet and convincing just as she should be. There is no big twist for her, nothing going on underneath that should be a big mystery, she is just an affectionate character and I loved to see her come to play and interact with the equally loving, yet more introvert Paterson. Their relationship felt incredibly genuine and raw in a way that few films have ever captured and serves as a perfect companion piece to something like "The Before Trilogy" which looks at relationships in a completely different way, but emerges with the same genuine emotion on screen.

Jarmusch keeps things simple behind the camera as it should be: the shots are simple, they don't call attention to themselves and the camera movement is minimal, even though when it actually starts moving there is always a reason for it, this is one of the best examples of charging camera movement with emotion. It is in the little details that one could loose hours researching and reflecting upon and that is exactly the function of the poetry in the film, which talks about small things but it charges them with significance and thematic power. You are constantly fascinated by the world portrayed on screen and it is thanks to a brilliant puzzle of editing, cinematography sound and performance that manages to capture a simple world and fill it with meaning and evolve only slightly through the film making you fascinated by every word uttered and every frame displayed.

I think that where the film stumbles is in its closing. It looked like it felt the need to give some kind of closure to the characters and not leave them as ordinarily as we found them and it felt a little too artificial when comparing it with the rest of the film. Paterson has some encounters which I didn't really buy into as they felt way too heavy on significance. Yet, the most problematic element in my opinion is the fact that I could have easily envisioned this film ending without any of these scenes and just by keeping the rhythm it had had up until then. I actually think that by going this way, Jarmusch partially deprived the film of the magic it was building with the beauty in everyday life, the message that ultimately gets conveyed didn't necessitate those symbolical scenes in my view.

"Paterson" is a wonderful experience, it fills your heart up with joy and tranquility, the poetic nature of the film is a stroke of genius and makes what is possibly the most bland premise of all time a riveting two hour watch that moved me deeply and made me reflect upon a wide range of themes.
