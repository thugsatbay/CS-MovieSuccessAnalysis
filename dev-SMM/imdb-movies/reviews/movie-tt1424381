### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I'm surprised at the polarized opinions of Predators here on IMDb. From fans of the original movie (like me), I would have expected a degree of respect for this latest iteration; it seems to honor its predecessors while still offering new twists and depth. Without presenting spoilers, I would simply say that there were developments in Predators that present some exciting opportunities for future films. I also always appreciated Predator for its "gravitas", and Predators continues that somber and grim tradition with arguably better acting. 

For new viewers, I don't see what more could have been expected. It's an old concept (The Most Dangerous Game, with hunted humans), but Predators does a good job with it. The acting is great, the lines are not successive groan-worthy quips, the cinematography is delicious, and the soundtrack is fantastic (segments of the original with new score!). Again, the overall plot isn't new, but at least it's not stupid. The characters behave in a realistic manner, and I wasn't plagued by the "why-didn't-they-just-do_____?" question for the entire movie.

Frankly, if you read a review from someone with a rating lower than five, they're just not being fair. Predators AT LEAST deserved to be watched and appreciated for what it offers.

Before I took a chance on this film there was really only one question I wanted answered...

'Is this film going to be another steaming pile of disappointment like the AVP films?'

And the answer, happily, is 'No', though after having to sift through all the unhelpful and uninformative 1 rater reviews here, I never would have guessed. I almost gave this film a miss, but I'm glad I didn't. It was actually quite good, and I'll tell you why (no spoilers I promise). 

I think it is important to go into this film with the right expectations. This film returns to the original Predator format, and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. There are scenes and characters (and even weapons) which are so reminiscent of the first film that they would not be out of place in a remake. I like to view this as very deliberate homage to the original rather than shameless plagiarism, and I enjoyed the film more and feel much happier because of it. Of course this is not a remake. It is a sequel with some major differences from the 1987 film, and enough originality to make it interesting and unique in its own right.

The story is not overly ambitious, they play it straight and the focus is given more to building tension, which it manages to do very well. Because it is a Predator film you kind of know what is going to happen, but it still manages to be suspenseful from the start, and there are quite a few surprises and twists along the way to keep you guessing. The unnerving way the truth of their situation unfolds for the characters is quite enthralling, and reminded me strongly of shows like 'The Outer Limits'.

The characters are interesting and all of them are well portrayed. Some are a little cliché, but the main character played by Adrien Brody is actually more human and teeters on the edge of being a full blown anti- hero. 

My only major gripe with this film is that there is little character development. The characters are (as I said) interesting, but there just doesn't seem to be enough time to explore them very deeply. The most you really get is a shallow glimpse of who they might be, which left question marks over some of their motivations. This does make the film slightly forgettable, as you never really end up feeling or caring too much for them, and sometime it feels like they do things just to drive the plot/action forward, rather than because it is something their character might do.

Overall I would give the film a 7 out of 10, it was above average for and action flick and screamed quality, despite a retentively low budget, and I definitely wouldn't mind going to see it again. An entertaining action thriller at worst, and a nice edition to the Predator franchise.

Just to clear the air, this film is not a reboot or a remake of Predator and its associated follow ups. Rather, it is an able complement to the established mythos, adding its own two cents worth to an expanding franchise, even though it chose to ignore the crossover hybrids with the Versus Aliens films, and connects itself directly to the first Predator film by John McTiernan starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Produced by Roger Rodriguez and directed by Nimrod Antal who did films like Kontroll, Vacancy and Armoured, Predators clearly met its objectives it set out to achieve without flashy fanfare, with Antal providing assured direction in the many set action pieces that don't rely on the hair-tearing quick MTV-styled cuts so just to let you know everything's kinetic and hyper. Some scenes will also get your eyebrows raised at how gory and violent this installment can get, with in-your-face dismemberment, and even one which shows how cruelly wicked the Predator can be with a move that closely resembles a "finish him" from Mortal Kombat.

The story is kept simple with one primary plot, and that is to witness how a band of para- military personnel get to outwit and outlast the Predators as they learn that they're prey and game for the alien beings, which are armed to the teeth in advanced weaponry, armour and various sensors like infra-red, with electromagnetic pulses ready to discharge and wreck havoc on human rifles. It's not a fair fight, especially when it comes to the famed cloaking camouflage that gives the Predators an advantage. 

But hey, who says hunting sport has to be fair anyway? In fact, this film only serves to cement the franchise plot point of having as many characters as possible to add to body count, and we're almost unlikely to hope for anyone to emerge unscathed when faced with such odds. But well, Schwarzenegger's character did it in the first film through a simple battle strategy, so perhaps this group of rag-tags have some of the same luck as well. Given the Predator's penchant to play with their game, don't expect instant blood and gore as a few teasers have to be in place, before the first death occurs (well, death to an unidentifiable actor, is no count)

Leading the team is Adrien Brody's reluctant soldier of fortune, who decides early on that while he's a member of the human tribe, he's not going to forge any emotional bonds with anyone, being quite dogged and determined to leave the gaming planet alive. This of course irks Isabelle (Alice Braga) the female soldier from Israel who holds a few secrets of her own, and others from the likes of Chechnyan soldier Nicolai (Oleg Taktarov) to the odd one out in Doctor Edwin (Topher Grace), given the rest have tasted real life action in the killing fields, now brought through alien abduction to a planet whose atmosphere is almost identical to Earth, for a game of survival skills.

The story also allows time to dwell on moral dilemma and ethical issues that fighters face in combat, with the strategies employed by the Predators seem to have come out of familiar theatres of war and rules of engagement, where traps are set not to kill but to maim, and fellow survivors forced to make hard decisions as to saving their new found compatriots, or whether it's all man for himself. While offering no surprise twists, with the A-list cast here you can bet that they are all roles which offer a slight challenge, and to see how what we have assumed is the rabbit of the group, able to flip the other way round gradually to reveal some violent, inner ambition.

One of the selling points here is of course watching Adrien Brody play the brooding action hero complete with bulging biceps and washboard stomach. The lack of young, emerging alpha-males in the action genre has somehow led to dramatic actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and now Brody to hit the gym to buff up for films that require the baring of torso, to make the characters they play more believable, since they are soldiers of sorts hell bent on saving the day. Laurence Fishburne did what he could with his limited appearance in becoming the oracle that is to educate everyone on what conditions are like on the unnamed planet.

But one thing that will be missed, is those frequent POVs as seen through the Predator's eyes and hi-tech helmet. The filmmakers seem to want to steer clear of this since it doesn't offer anything new, but I always thought it was cool to adopt the Predator's first perspective. That aside, Predators delivered when it mattered, even though the story seemed like a shade of the original, and the aliens aren't really using the entire plethora of weapons available to them. One can continuously make the Predator films since this one opened doors, and it'll be interesting to see how others apply their take on the mythos now.

A Nutshell Review: Predators

In a season of remakes, re-imagining's and sequels, Predators certainly lives up to what's expected of it. It's a re-imagining of the classic 80's action movie which had Arnie take the reigns as the leader of a super band of commando's being hunted by an extra terrestrial in the middle of the (jungle), and ended up spawning quite a franchise, consisting of a sequel, and 2 movie mash ups, the Alien vs. Predator films. Fans of the original and followers of the franchise can be forgiven for being weary of this remake (after all, I was), but believe me, Predators is the best in the series since the original.

Predators, as the name suggests, features more than 1, which alone makes you wonder how true to the original this will be. Well, the movie approaches this question in a strange way. First, it takes the original premise of a band of elite warriors being hunted by an unstoppable alien menace, and gives quite a unique and refreshing twist, delivering another band of elite warriors, but this time being hunted by 3 Predators, and on THEIR planet, rather than Earth. Then on top of this, Predators takes much of what made the original great; the cheesy dialogue, the big guns, the crude humour, and even some of the same great moments, and adds them in to give Predators its own unique style, while still paying a worthy homage to the classic. There are some direct references to please the original fans, but it's not spoiled by filling it with references that only the die-hard fans would understand like many other movies are. Most of the action scene's deliver and the fire fights are well done. The scenery of the planet is beautiful (though it's actually only Hawaii), and the movie generally has a good pace, despite some times where this falters. And I have to award bonus points for the movie's opening: it was a unique way of introducing us to the situation, and without giving too much away, it sucks you in, even if it is a little far-fetched. 

But don't get too excited, the movie definitely has its problems. Some of the dialogue, especially of one character is just bad, and I'm still not sure whether or not it tried to do it purposely and just failed, or if the writers just scribbled down anything they could think of at the last minute. Then there's also some back-story and deeper meaning to the entire Predator universe and their scenario, which is nice, but at times it really drags on and takes the rest of the movie down with it. There's also one specific scene, which includes a homage to the original, but is ridiculous, and apart from the reference, it's almost laughable. One of the biggest things that got me though, and it may not annoy others, is the amount of Predator screeches and screams. It seemed as though every 5 minutes, another Predator was screaming for some unknown reason. Maybe he didn't hit what he was aiming for, maybe he trod on a sharp rock, or maybe his Predator wife left him and he's not taking too well, but any way I don't care what's happened, so please stop screaming at me! The casting is strange to say the least. Adrien Brody, trying to channel the essence of Schwarzenegger, and who would have been my last pick as an action hero, pulls off the role surprising well. Most of the actors perform satisfyingly, and the brief appearances by Laurence Fishburne and Danny Trejo are a nice touch. My only queries with the casting are that of Topher Grace. He spends the entire movie seeming out of place, not quite fitting in to the situation, and at no point is he even slightly convincing as the character he is meant to portray. 

Predators was released with some big shoes that it knew it had to fill, and so instead of trying to outdo the original or be new and fresh, it uses what made the original great to its advantage. I must say kudos to Nimrod Antal for directing, and kudos to the make-up department, because they definitely outdid themselves with this project. Predators is a refreshing shot in the arm to a nearly dead franchise, and stands out in the ocean of movie remakes and sequels that Hollywood is churning out. For what it's designed to be, an action blockbuster popcorn flick, it definitely delivers.

It is important to note that despite it's perspicuous title, Nimrod Antal's "Predators" is no reboot of its establishing material. It's a honest-to-goodness sequel to the first two Predators films; a long awaited one at that after a couple of detours into the realm of crossovers into the "Alien" universe. It does however represent a stylistic update and intriguing expansion of the franchise's filmic mythology that also spans Dark Horse Comics' graphic novels and its video games.

However, if there ever were to be a more convincing statement of intent in relaunching this franchise, it would have been putting its marquee producer Robert Rodriguez to work in a film so suited to his aesthetics and stylistic idiosyncrasies. But Rodriquez's pick to helm this film almost proves to be reason enough to watch this given that Nimrod Antal is one of the most exciting directors around these days. Antal's direction has always coincided with his a strong sense of atmosphere and character development. With his fascinating debut, "Kontroll" and his cleverly constructed meta-slasher, "Vacancy" as well as with last year's taut action spectacle "Armored", Antal has shown himself to be an effective genre director in that he's both comfortable in affirming a particular genre as he is deconstructing it. And in "Predators", he infuses it with not just a showcase of tried and tested sci-fi ideals but also a discernible impression of a robust horror film.

Antal keeps things moving along at an exhilarating pace by introducing a rag-tag team of mercenaries and criminals getting air-dropped into a highly tropical and vegetative alien planet tailored by the ruthless and single-minded Predator race as a game reserve for the insufficiently armed humans and other prey. Its mise-en-scene immediately hearkens back to the jungle warfare of the first "Predator". As the movie gods demand, the herd gets thinned as the race of alien hunters reveal themselves to be superior in both their technology and understanding of game theory. Kept alive by de facto leader, the preternaturally perspicacious Royce (Adrien Brody), the band of humans begin to formulate their plan of survival against the truly fearsome Predators and their formidable weaponry.

Brody's presence seems almost folly at first  a gruff vocal inflection worthy of Christian Bale's in "The Dark Knight" underscores a predictably rote tough guy but to his credit, a good actor always manages to sell his act despite himself. Like his character, who sees no virtue in human connection but instead adopts a ranger-like approach to survival, Brody doesn't seem to create much chemistry with his cast mates in his relatively new role as action hero. The rest of its main supporting cast are split of into archetypes  Alice Braga is Isabelle, an Israeli soldier and its burgeoning conscience, Topher Grace plays Dr. Edwin, the geeky comic relief and notably, the talented Walter Goggins of TV's "The Shield" and "Justified" is the smarmy knife-wielding death-row convict, Stans. Also, rounding of the surviving humans is the reticent Yakuza gangster, Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and the relatively noble Chechnyan soldier, Nikolai (Oleg Taktarov).

Antal manages this character list well enough. As the chase progresses, you get a distinct feel of each human before they start to fall victim to their raison d'être. Besides a late flurry of actual and conspicuous violence, "Predators" actually fares better in its early scenes where the humans explore their predicament and the film plays the suspense card remarkably well. There's an actual interest in finding out the psyches of these mysterious humans who are hunters and monsters on Earth but scurrying mice on the Predator's turf.

If anything else, the script provides little genuine surprises in it storytelling. Given its inherent similarities, the film bares a stunning amount of resemblance to last year's terrific "Pandorum"  where a space crew wakes up with no memory onboard a vessel designed as a Noah's Ark of sorts to vicious creatures hunting them. There's a scene with Laurence Fishburne as the planet's loony veteran survivor that cribs more than just mood but actual dialogue from the superior film.

"Predators" doesn't change the game too much but as far as delivering a solid and experience to its fanbase, it releases itself from the shackles of relying on crossovers and re-establishes the Predator as one of Hollywood's most fertile sources of sci-fi villains.

It seems to me that anyone watching this will probably have already seen the original 1987 Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and probably most of the other movies featuring the predator race. If that's true, then you've nothing to gain by seeing this - those who suggest it's new material must have seen a different movie.

In the previews, a big deal is made about how this film is different - new super predators, multiple alien species, takes place on an alien planet, etc. Sadly, the differences are actually minimal, and this is simply a study in plagiarism.

Largely military personnel are cut down by a group of predators. Sorry, super predators. You can tell the difference because they're a few inches taller, have bigger teeth, and their shoulder mounted canons have a different special effect. Should have spotted that.

They're in a jungle. Oh, but not an earth jungle (despite one character recognising and naming the plant life from his knowledge of Earth based plants - incidentally, allegedly a doctor, not a botanist, which is a curiosity in itself).

When you add to this mix one female member of the group to match the mix in the original, the predator whispers from the first movie (not used in a similar way, the same words, which the predator copied from hearing Mac say them in the first movie, but are not spoken by humans in this one...), the same lines being delivered by the main characters as Arnie used, precise duplications of specific camera shots, similar traps as Arnie made towards the end of the first movie, and a final battle between a mud covered human and the last remaining predator, and so on, and so forth.

Yes, there are some differences. For instance, the action starts almost right away, with no chance to meet the main characters and know anything about them as happens in the first, they are just thrown into the action and left to fend for themselves, with nothing but some crap dialogue and, oh, magically, a similar assortment of weapons as Arnie's team.

I watched aghast as the characters are slaughtered one by one. Not because I cared about them, but because so much more could have been done with them before they're offed. The Russian spetsnaz guy, elite special forces, probably the toughest, best trained special forces personnel in the world, is shown to be a trigger happy moron. I know it's an American movie and they have to show US forces as the be all end all of the world's fighting men, but please, this is ridiculous. The yakuza finds an old samurai blade to wield (and uses one of his few lines as a copy of one in Predator 2 commenting that they've been doing this a while) - convenient that the only old fashioned weapon there was just what he was proficient in using, don't you think. And what does he get to do with it? Anybody else seen Seven Samurai? Yep, plagiarism again as he uses it to duel with the predator, having stayed behind to fight him - just like Billy from the first movie, amazingly enough.

I would give this movie one star for it's weak story, weak script, poor acting and unashamed duplication of other films if it wasn't for a great performance from Laurence Fishburne which was sadly far too short, and again, his character was utterly wasted. Still, his few minutes of screen time lift my vote to three stars... albeit grudgingly.

I expected more of a movie with Robert Rodriguez pulling the strings even if it was Hungarian director Nimrod Antal at the helm. I even fell into that old Hollywood hype trap and expected at least halfway decent entertainment for my money having seen the trailer - but the most promising scene in the trailer, where the protagonist is lit up by multiple red dot sights from shoulder canons doesn't actually appear in the film at all.

If you want more predator action in your life, go rent the original again - it may be dated and a bit cheesy in places, but it's a far better way to spend your money, even if you have already seen it many times over.

what is wrong with most of you????????? this movie was made so poor, it promised so much but delivered very little. if you get through the first 40 Min's of the movie without falling asleep you have done well as the character building was bad bad bad, all the characters had something stolen from the original movie. if you are a big fan of the first movie you will be disappointed as they have taken everything which made predator original and copied in some way for this movie. i lost count of the amount of lines stolen from the first, characters were the same, music was the same, it had everything from Blaine's character being replaced with some other army guy with the same chain gun!!!, Billy's character replaced with a Yakuza who's end was built up the same as Billy's even the music the same. Adrian Brody had developed the Christian bale voice at times and even used Arnie's classic line from the first "do it do it now kill me" his fight with the super black predator was a joke and made the predator look so dumb. if this movie could not of got any worse they decided to put a serial killer in the mix of it all which i am sorry was just done awful as he decides to show his evil side at the point which he has just been captured by the predators (so he should be scared right, serial killer or not, looking for way out right, looking for help with his fellow prisoner right, wrong he will just decide to try and kill her in he mix of it all, so bad. Laurence Fishburne not much to say here really but what a waste of time and guess what they stole classic lines from the first movie again with him. the lack of predators was a disappointment as was the lack of hunting by them, they also seemed to forgot that the predators have some pretty good weapons but chose to use none of them in this movie (maybe 2 or 3 shoulder cannon shots but that is it, not even the classic spear was in this. i did watch this movie with 3 others who all were very very disappointed. oh and one more thing remember the trailer when Adrian Brody had about 20 predator target aims all over his body, yeah this did not happen try just ONE instead, to sum up a pile of crap.

Predators is directed by Nimród Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator.

The plot sees eight former members of Earth - mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted, it seems, for sport.

In 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse (though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster), reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel - with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However, it didn't happen and it's only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster.

The set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie, it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth, which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be.

However, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberment's, beheadings and everyones personal fave - spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody.

Brody is just fine, it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in action/adventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clichés, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it first/next and etc. It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, he's also very miscast, but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either.

Not great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder. A sequel would be welcome, but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel. 7/10

I just got out of the premier for Predators and let me say I wasn't disappointed at all. The acting was solid as a rock, every scene just stood out and the movie kept you interested throughout its entirety.

It was interesting to see how each character was unique in their own way and the movie was full of twists and all of the questions popping in my head while watching it were answered.

There was a nice amount of gore but, it was not overdone and I enjoyed that a lot. 

I won't get into too much of detail but I will say that any predator fan or even someone who likes a good action/thriller should watch this movie. It was worth the 9 dollars I spent and I wouldn't even mind watching it again in the theaters.

I had been anticipating this movie for over a year and my prayers were answered. Thank you Robert Rodriquez and Nimrod Antal for not letting me down. This movie has absolutely rebooted the predator franchise and I can't wait to see what is in store for the future.

GO WATCH THIS MOVIE.

Being a massive predator fan, i was was glad to hear alan silvestri's original score back at the beginning of this movie and it made me think 'this could be one for the fans!'. How wrong i was. The good people at 20th Century Fox obviously wanted to make a fast buck using the Predator franchise and con fans with a decent looking trailer most of which didn't even appear in the movie (particularly Adrien Brody being targeted by around 10 predators at once when in reality its just one predator targeting). The script was just awful with all the stupid childish comedy moments and lines. I mean if I was dropped in a jungle after being abducted by aliens I certainly wouldn't be saying 'Your ass is awesome!' or planning on a cocaine and 'bitch raping' spree. So much of Predator 1987 was copied very badly. Blaine being replaced with a Russian who carried an old painless style gun, the yakuza guy staying back armed with a samurai sword instead of a machete just like Billy and Adrien Brody SLAUGHTERING Schwarzeneggers 'DO IT! DO IT NOW! KILL ME!' when fighting that god awful looking super predator. Stan Winston would be spinning in his grave if he knew his amazing creation had been ruined like this. The human characters were just as bad as their acting. The effects were dire. The camouflage looked like a child had drawn it on screen and the fire effects were even worse. Alan Silvestri's score looked to be the only saving grace until some genius decided to kill it by putting a rock beat through it. Why??? This movie made avpR look like a crowning moment in cinema history!! I honestly cant think of one really decent scene. Any self respecting Predator fan should avoid this movie like it was AIDS. I was genuinely disgusted and angered by this movie. In conclusion: Robert Rodriguez. Keep your franchise reboot scripts to yourself from now on. You should be ashamed of yourself. 20th Century Fox. You should be even more ashamed by giving Rodriguez's script the green light. Please let the Predator franchise die with what scraps of dignity it has left.

There's somethin' out there waiting for us....n it ain't no good movie.

Just have been in the cinema. I was an IMDb victim. Yeah, because of the (in sum) good reviews. Now i know it was the 'this is different, so i have to praise it in order to get praised' reflex. The difference is to use (one) quality actors.

This movie is bad. Worser than T4. There is not one believable scene and now we come to this argument: believable.

Scifi is meant to be a genre were interesting situations appear. situations, which normally wouldn't happen, like dropping on an alien planet and survive against alien hunters. As long as people react real, it could be very entertaining how they manage to survive and what you, the audience would do. There is no deus ex device in this flick, but it wouldn't make any difference:

- 8 people staying rooted on the spot shooting with their Gatlings until out of ammo on one wolf like creature with no success - a moment later one shot does it right??

- They use rotten one liners like "i am ready to die, you too?", "doesn't matter who they are or where there come from, i kill them all"

Dumb scene - dumb dialog... ...and so on alternating until the credits.

Dumb action scenes are NOT interesting, they DO NOT make tension, they are just annoying.

Antal Nimrod took the opposite way what made predator or aliens so great.

Nimrod must think very bad of his audience. He don't want us to think while and after about this movie. Adrien Brodys mission is to talk us from one scene to the next with constant conclusions about the situation which are only knowable if his character 'royce' has the script in his pocket (besides he immediately identified a plasma weapon).

Brody, a known actor of format must have denied reading the script or is quality management not meant to be used by the actors? His role is unbelievable nonstop-nonsense, paired with the batman voice.

The rest are mega-close ups, close combat scenes and jungle.

Some days ago i saw Rambo (first blood) again. Yesterday the original Predator. Action movies with interesting character and/or story are not common these days. 

Action filmmakers today get caught by the coolness trap. Just to say its cool doesn't make it cool, more the opposite. A little less polemic in an example: Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and Dillon (Weathers) are Predator original characters. They are always trying to be cynical with a smirk on their face. When things go dangerously wrong, they act like everybody else, but face the situations and don't try to be cool anymore but to survive until the air is cleared. That makes them lifelike and touchable. Royce (Brody) just try to be cool, because the script says so. He doesn't make any facial expressions, nor he makes any interesting character streaks. He is just here. Like any other character in Predators.

In this movie, they (Nimrod and Rodriguez) tell you everything: who is cool, what you have to think, why the character do what they do except of doing it the logical and less dangerous way, but they owe as an explanation why they are allowed to handle millions of dollars for this outcome.

There are some other major problems, like the use of thinkable every possible clichés (fe: Russians wear blue-white striped shirts), the use of archetypes, shaky-cam, and so on... Forget this flick. It is garbage. Or don't believe me and see for yourself but be aware that you subsidize future film projects of this 'format' and nothing will change.

After reading the reviews and watching the trailer, I was excited to see the movie. One word...terrible. Have you ever started watching a movie and it didn't start off very good, but you think to yourself, 'Hmmm, I did just pay $10 to see this movie. I'll just stick it out. I'm sure it gets good.' Then as you continue on in the movie the writing gets worse, the music doesn't fit, and the acting is questionable, but again you think, 'Okay. It's been like 45 minutes, i'm sure its gonna get good now. It's really too late to leave. What if I leave and then it gets good. No. No. I'll just stay.' And the movie continues to get worse and worse. By the end you are upset and think, 'Okay this is the end. Please, please redeem yourself. Dazzle me.' Ugh, the ending is god awful. You walk out of the movie theater feeling disgusting for falling for such a sham. Then this supposed 'action' film starts playing this completely random song that sounds like Rockin' Robin by Little Richie... What?! Didn't this battle just happen between human and Predator and now you are playing a Rockin' Robin sound-a-like song? Odd. Cheesy, Cliché, Predictable, and Out of place. They spend more time showing the entire cast come through a door rather than showing them make traps which they out of the blue start talking about. "They see our traps." What? What traps? Did you see them make any traps? No, but I did spend 2 minutes watching the entire cast climb through a door. If you start watching the movie and you start getting that feeling like 'Hmmm, this is terrible. Nah, I'm sure it will get good.' I suggest you trust your gut, leave before you reach the half way point, and get your money back. Epic fail.

The original "Predator" is one of my favorite films. You can tell the makers of this film watched the original and ripped off most of the plot and threw it into this one... The Cast? whoever did the casting for this sequel should be shot...weak character buildup, bad acting, etc...

One part that really cracks me up is when Lawrence Fishburne's character is introduced, he's wearing one of those cool Predator "cloaking" devices and one of their weapons...he takes it off and then you don't see it or the weapon used again in the movie...c'mon guys! don't you think that it would of come in handy fighting the Predators??!!!..whatever...the original movie is still the best...

You suck Robert Rodrigues!

As a big fan of the original I have been excited about Predators since it was announced, with the talent behind it what could possibly go wrong? ...well quite a bit actually. There is no character development. In the original you cared when Blaine had his stomach blown out and Mac mourned him, you give a sh*t when Billy went out in a blaze of glory (off screen of course). In predators the characters are thrown into the jungle and it is not long after they start to meet their makers at the hands of the predators. This means you never really care when someone bites it and was it me or were the deaths in this not as bloody. There is no tension, no sense of dread like in the original, although there is 3 predators you don't see enough of them and they are big softies when you do, they just don't seem as intimidating as the original predator. The acting sucks why people think Adrian Brody put in a good performance is beyond me. He thinks you act tough by putting on a Batman style gruff voice, I just sat there wishing Dutch would turn up and blow Brady away.

The plot premise is a good one but the execution is poor. I guessed instantly the order the characters would die in from the off, it was so obvious it was untrue.

Finally the worst thing of all ..Laurence Fishburne, wow possibly one of the worst pieces of acting I have seen, he stunk the cinema out. There was zero point to his character and thank god he is only in it briefly I could not have handled Laurence's sorry attempt at acting a bit mad for the whole movie.

Maybe I am being harsh as I love predator so I had very high expectations going into the cinema. The only positives are the action set pieces are well filmed and Louis Ozawa Changchien is pretty cool as the nearly silent assassin Hanzo.

Overall a real letdown, bring back Dutch, Dillon, Mac and the rest of the original crew.

How many bad movies does this hack director (I mean the guys name is NIMROD, HELLO PEOPLE!) gotta make before people know he sucks. How did Robert Rodriguez stand by and allow this travesty take place? Who were the people that read this script and said "oh that's a great idea, go make it?" 

This movie is NOTHING but a baby step away from the original 'Predator', hardly anything original or new. So lets break it down step by step.

Cast: Adrian Brody as our alpha male hero? You gotta be f****** kidding me! Do I really need to explain why the guy from 'The Pianist' does not need be slugging it out with a giant creature from another world? Dwyane 'The Rock' Johnson, Stallone (and his 'Expendables' cast), Russel Crowe, or Eric Bana would have all made better leads! And the supporting cast was WEAK! Topher Grace should only be on TV for reruns of 'That 70's Show', that's about it. Since each character came from somewhere different they had absolutely no chemistry together. Their interaction was about as exciting as watching paint dry. And Lawrence Fishburns character was a WASTE. No explanation, we meet him for 2 minutes and then he tries to kill the group but just gets himself killed with a TERRIBLE CG effect. 

Script: Basically they just took 'Predator', replaced the characters and put them in a different setting. Which by the way if their hadn't been the 1 establishing shot of them looking up to see they were on a different planet, their entire story/setting could have passed for earth. So you took me all the way to an alien planet just so it could look like earth? WTF. And the Predators were WAY too easy to kill, how bout a lil story line that beefs them up a bit? Or how about a little original story line at all! Amazing how RR craps all over 'Predator 2' when that movie was 10 times better and more original then this POS. So monsters kill the group off 1 by 1 till the big grand.....why bother explaining this, if you've seen the first 'Predator', you've seen this. And watching lil ol Adrian Brody beat up a 7 foot tall, 500 pound gorilla monster predator was like watching Brock Lessnar lose a fight to a 3rd grader. And it wasn't like I didn't notice the several scenes that were stolen from other movies. Example, when the Russian dies.....I DARE someone to say that wasn't stolen from 'Aliens' when Vasquez gets trapped and blows herself up to kill the monster. They even did the fire through the tunnels and up to the people getting away (just like 'Aliens'). 

Special Effects: Now if nothing else I was at least hoping this would be the one saving grace of this movie, and once again I was wrong. Sub 1997 special effects. The "wild dogs" looked as bout as CG as you can get. The predators looked all rubery and fake (unlike P1 and P2), they had NO new/cool weapons. For Chr*** sake, this movie takes place on another planet. Have some FUN with it, go crazy like 'Star Wars' and make the place different and new!

.....I can't write anymore, it's hurting my brain to think about this movie. And I'm sure Arnold is on the hunt, but this time he's not after the Predator. He's after a turd named Robert Rodriguez, and he's gunna hunt him like a panther in the night!

Conclusion: DO NOT go see in theaters (you'll only be agrivated and want your money back). Do NOT buy on Blu-Ray/DVD. If you must see this movie to scratch your 'Predator' itch, I would rent. Maybe from the comfort of home and the assistance of alcohol this movie might go down a little easier.

First of all, it's not a reboot as many speculates, it's direct continuation to Predator 1&2, and only AVPs are dismissed but the movie doesn't neglect them altogether, we get to see alien like skulls in the movie, however alien universe is wholly neglected.

Let's start with the best part of the movie, the acting. It's very rare for a sci-fi movie to contain good acting these days, all gone are the days of Alien/Aliens/Blade runner etc. where the acting used to get all the praise more than action. In Predators, every single character is very believable and delivers. It's astonishing to see the acting of Brody, he deserves an Oscar for his role as Royce more than he did in "The Pianist" as Szpilman. Rest of the cast did very well too, they perfectly fill in their boots as group of elite warriors. It would be fair to say that compared to the original Predator movie, this movie exceeds in the acting department.

Next comes the story line, it's pretty much based on "The Most Dangerous Game", the story itself is well written and not rushed, it takes time to unfold events, and ample time is given to develop characters. There is really a fear and eerie feeling in the story, and we don't get to see the hunters very often, which adds more thrill and suspense to the story; just like the original flick. To me an unseen threat is more scarier than seeing the perpetrator every minute.

The music is tense, almost reminiscent of Alan Silversti score in the original. Good thing here is that it's not overdone, and the drum beats are used rightfully when the situation demands it to. Really nice work by the composer.

As for CGI, it's very minimal and not overdone as well, although not same as the original which is understandable since a lot of progress have been made in graphics department since 80's, take Avatar for example.

I also want to talk little bit about violence and rating of the movie, it's also not very frequent we get to see spine ripped off and people chopped into half by laser guns these days, had crafty cuts to the movie not been made, this flick could very well been awarded an NC-17 rating.

Last but not the least, this flick is an instance of how a good movie can be made on a small budget, you don't require big budget for your movie to please audiences, you just need to have a vision thing to make pleasurable flicks for them. Kudos goes to Nimród Antal & Robert Rodriguez for such a great effort.

Final score:-

Direction: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Story line: 8/10

I enjoyed this film largely because it makes no attempts to familiarize its audience with what is going on. We are instead thrust into the situation as blindly as the characters are, except how ever we know the films called Predators, so we do have a good idea of what the characters are up against. Additionally, the casting is fantastic. The film contains a large variety of characters that add a whole lot of flavor to the film. Whether its Danny Trejo's Mexican cartel background or the mystery surrounding Topher Grace's character, there is always something to keep you something to keep on your mind while the characters try to avoid falling prey to the Predators. Additionally,I really enjoy Adrien Brody in any role he is in, and his venture into the sci-fi action scene is no exception. After having seen this film and Splice I cant wait to see what he does next, I like seeing the added range of an already proved actor.

Now having said all this, the film isn't without its disappointments, I feel the film needed to spend a little time explaining how our characters got to this reserve planet. Further, the "Most Dangerous Game" theme has worn a little on me and I feel with the actors involved they could have added an additional thoughtful theme to lift this movie from B-movie fun to a complete more thought provoking film.

Bottom line: Predators is a very well made film, with likable characters and plenty of blood splattering fun. Just don't expect too anything too profound in way of plot or theme. But seriously, you are seeing a Predator movie, so I doubt you're expecting that.

I don't know how this movie can get anything over a 5. Either the people who are writing the reviews are 12, or they really have no clue what a good movie is.

When have the standards gotten so low for movies?? I read reviews about this movie that said it is "good" because they did not "expect much", or because it was "better than the other sequels."(Which are btw some of the worst movies I have ever seen) A movie should be rated on whether it is GOOD or NOT.

This movie is NOT good. The story could have been interesting but it failed, miserably. 

Some gripes that come to mind are:

-As others have mentioned, why would highly intelligent aliens abduct killers just to hunt them? Obviously if they can abduct them, what's the sense of hunting them? 

-Why does Adrian Brody sound like batman? 

-How does Adrian Brody and the rest of the cast figure everything out about the Predators and Planet?

-As soon as you meet the complete 8 Strangers, you know right off the bat Adrian Brody and the chick will be the only to survive. Obvious as day.

-Why do these highly advanced Predators need "dogs" to hunt & track the humans? Again we are talking about a highly advanced species.

-In the Original Predator, the Predator stalked and hunted a complete elite military force and killed them all but Arnold. How is it in this version that 3 bigger and badder species of Predators get killed much easier, by random "killers" at that, and on their own "hunting grounds"? Seriously?

-In the Original Predator you actually sympathized for the cast, because the movie was actually built up properly. In this version I could careless who lived. Matter of fact I was hoping none of them survived.

-The Yakuza character manages to wear his full suit throughout the whole movie without breaking a sweat and still looking perfectly clean. Mind you he is running through a jungle, getting chased by Predators, alien dogs, dodging bullets, yet he is still in his suit all throughout.

-I agree with another reviewer, how the hell did the one Soldier built such an elaborate trap with no tools. Not even McGyver was so handy.

-When they realize they aren't on earth, it barely seems to bother any of them. You would expect someone to either freak out, or think they are going insane. Not here.

-Laurence Fishbourne has managed to use the Predator's Cloaking technology, yet nobody seems to care or mention using it as potential tool to fight the Predators. Laurence Fishbourne might as well of just been wearing regular clothes..

-The Psycho Killer, no idea what that had to do with the movie. Another Hollywood twist.

I could go on and on and on...

I feel like this movie was thrown together, with no attention to detail and lacked any originality. Half the movie is a spin off of the original. A horrible one at that. 

The original Predator is one of the best sci-fi movies. The story, acting, everything about it is excellent. It actually kept you on the edge of your seat, interested in the characters, and sympathizing with Arnold in the last fight scene.

Predators did the total opposite. Bottom line if you were expecting a revival of the series like I was, you will be seriously disappointed.

I went in with average expectations and I was still let down. The Predator's good name has been tarnished over the years by turning what was once a scary monster into a franchise that sells toys to kids. Crossing it over with Alien was a bad idea that resulted in an indescribably awful film in 2004 and, impossibly, an even worse film in 2008. As far as I was concerned the franchise was dead. Fox had eviscerated it in a way that even the Pred himself was find appalling.

But then came Robert Rodriguez to the rescue. R-Rod apparently wrote the script in 1994 as Predator 3 and ever since it had been in production hell. The internet rumors said it was a remake, then a reboot, then R-Rod assured us it was a straight-up sequel to the long-underrated Predator 2 and that it would disregard the AvP travesties.

Well thank Jeebus for that because the arrogant and philistine nature of all of these wretched reboots/reimaginings is really getting on my nerves. But answer me this...why, if this IS essentially Predator 3 and not a remake, do R-Rod and Nimrod Antal spend 90% of the film referencing the first Predator and cramming in-jokes into the story. And why, if they hated AvP so much, did they lift dialogue corresponding to an identical scene and re-use it? 

BE YOUR OWN FILM!!!

There ain't none of guts, and grit, and grain of McTiernan's tour-de-force from 1987. What we get in 2010 is a glossy, slick, CGI-coated fanboy's wet dream.

Seven tough guys and a latino chick (sound familiar?) find themselves on an alien planet and soon deduct, through repetitive exposition, that they are there to be hunted. The first 30 minutes are somewhat muted (echoing McTiernan's approach) before they, as expected, begin to die one-by-one. How original.

It's almost impossible to list the many, many faults in the script, but I'll try. My first grievance is that the motivations of the characters are so undefined I'm dubious as to whether not they actually exist. Adrien Brody's character (Royce, who isn't named until the final minute) is supposed to be the Alpha Male of the group, but he's certainly no Dutch Shaeffer. There's nothing mythic or memorable about him whatsoever, and his methods for defeating the otherworldly antagonists are questionable as well as being mostly irrelevant.

The other six men dropped into the meat grinder are a collection of stereotypes rather than names. The Mexican, the Jailbird, the Russian, The Yakuza, the African and the Doctor. Some are already heavily armed, a few are not. Did the Predator's arm them or were they already clutching weapons? Did the Predators really think that hunting a weedy doctor would make good sport? 

But here's the biggest problem with the movie...how the hell did the Predators pick their prey? Did they study them from the space? How did they get the Jailbird? Break into prison and kidnap him without anyone seeing? And if Topher Grace's doctor is supposed to be a serial killer (another plot element that is so poorly delivered I'm confused about whether or not it qualifies as actually existing) then how the hell would the Predators be able to figure that out? Do they have some sort of space detective agency that determined he'd be a worthy prey to take across the galaxy? Absolute nonsense! 

A lot of hype preceded Larry Fishburne's role as Noland, the survivor/scavenger. But his role is utterly pointless other than to provide a bit of exposition and supply the rest of the characters with more weapons to keep on fighting before he's unceremoniously killed off with bad CGI. He also explains that there are two types of Predator out there, like Wolves compared to dogs. We see, what appears to be, a very skinny and naked Predator hunt Mr. Mad Doctor but once it's dead there isn't even a decent establishing shot of what it really is. But it doesn't matter anyway since, like the boar-dogs, they're completely forgotten about by the next scene.

The four Predators themselves are not scary in the slightest. In Predator he was kept shrouded in mystery and his methods and style gave him personality. In Predator 2, despite being seen more, he was still a deadly and formidable enemy. But here, with four of them vying for screen time, they are just creatures we're waiting to see killed and not anything even remotely terrifying.

And if these characters are supposed to be excellent prey for the Rastafarian Pred-heads then I am suspicious as to what actually counts for decent sport on Planet Predator. These people have the WORST aim in film history. They fire hundreds and hundreds of rounds (presumably they have some sort of infinite ammo cheat code as they certainly are not carrying as much as they fire) but do very little damage to their many pursuers. I don't think they could even hit the floor if they fell on it.

I was relieved to learn that John Debney was using Alan Silvestri's wonderful themes from the first two movies. But he does so little with the material it's almost a carbon copy of the first. It's not like there's nowhere left to go with the themes. Look at how Silvestri reinterpreted his own melodies for Predator 2. Are you telling me that an alien planet filled with awe and mystery couldn't provide a setting for a deeper and more interesting score? 

I've had it franchises. Bond. Freddy. Jason. Predator...all of them! I want new movies with new directions. Not stale, decades-old characters and directors more interested in writing love-letters to them than actually making a movie with lasting appeal.

If I wanted to watch Predator I would have stuck-on the Blu Ray. When money is spent on a supposed sequel it should deliver something new. Predators fails on this promise.

Loved every minute of this movie. Was it Oscar material? NO! However, it was entertaining and fun to watch from start to finish. The characters are pretty thin and not much story develops outside of just staying alive. Royce is the "cool" guy in the squad and all the best lines come from him. Although the Topher Grace and the "death row" inmate have some classic lines also. I just want to add how nice it was to see the Predators doing what they to best again. No more Alien hunting. This is a true follow-up to the original and everything is kept very simple. Shoot a lot of bullets, miss every time and get killed in a horrible way. Perfect!

The latest Predator movie, "Predators", tries to follow in the difficult footsteps of James Cameron's "Aliens". It's a sequel to the first film ("Predator"), it emphasizes action like the original, and it mixes in a few interesting ideas in its own thought experiment. It shares some characteristics with past films to depict humans as game for hunters ("Death Race 2000", "The Running Man") and to drop humans in a mysterious environment as select participants in a something ("Cube"). The mixture of these elements, with additional ideas about warfare and morality, creates an entertaining brew of action, Sci-Fi, and adventure.

Robert Rodriguez (as producer) and Nimród Antal (as director) breath new life into the Predator franchise. As aliens go, Predators replicate the typical human form as a safe foundation and then get enough simple variations to make the resulting being somewhat alien and believable. The movie perhaps imagines that the Predators control multiple life supporting planets (suggested by their advanced technology), and have enough of them to turn at least one into a hunting preserve, which becomes central to the story. They hunt multiple kinds of species at the preserve, but humans are a particular favorite. And these games have been going on for many seasons. We don't learn much about Predator culture broadly speaking, but we get little hints about them and their intentions.

The dominant perspective is that of 8 newly arrived humans. They wake up in free fall over a jungle, their shoots open automatically, and they don't trust anyone. A little luck helps get a team assembled when Royce (Adrien Brody) and Isabelle (Alice Braga) work together to settle down a trigger happy Russian soldier (Oleg Taktarov). They are suspicious enough of their new environment to seek answers and not just shoot anything they meet. Some of this seems convincing. Someone waking under such strange conditions would likely suppose that other people were also taken from their previous lives and were likewise dropped off. The plot also has enough of the opposite mind set (where a life form attacks fellow game participants in a panic) to make sense of it as a realistic world and not just a simple setup for a death hunt.

Royce (Adrien Brody) emerges as the reluctant leader, but Isabelle (Alice Braga) is the connective tissue of the group. The other humans seem mostly chosen for their skill as human predators in the human world, including soldiers from around Earth, a death row inmate, a silent Japanese gang member, and a Mexican drug cartel gunman. But one member says he's an American doctor, Edwin (Topher Grace), and Royce notes he seems out of place with a team of mercenaries, which adds an element of suspicion between the group members.

The group learns their situation indirectly from plot twists, but Royce makes a few logical deductions from clues around them: A dead special forces soldier, previously engaged in the game, had left a perimeter of defensive traps (for what purpose?). A herd of vicious, thorny alien creatures suddenly attack them and then run away at the sound of a whistle (who directs them?). Royce concludes that the creatures were meant to scurry and test the humans in the same way humans use dogs in game hunting. And, third, the Predators maim a human and use him as a trap to lure other humans (a tactic made popular by Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket"). It isn't clear why the Predators use such a trap when they have such excellent fighting skills and a warrior ethic, but perhaps it's meant to bring out the other humans and open them to attack.

In any case, it presents a theme of survival versus morality. Do they walk into the trap and help the maimed man (reducing their survival chances) or do they leave him and save themselves? It recurs throughout the movie. Of course, a popular movie made to revitalize the Predator franchise can't produce any shocking takes on the question, and can only give the socially acceptable answer. But it does mix in a few unexpected twists on the theme when the group meets a scavenger and survivalist, Noland (Laurence Fishburne), another human soldier who has experience fighting Predators for many seasons. (He measures seasons by the number of times humans have dropped in and Predators have wiped them out). Laurence Fishburne gives a strong and compelling performance with such a short time to make his character convincing.

Noland is in favor of survival over any moral considerations. Noland (Laurence Fishburne) gives us interesting information on their intentions. Predators seek to continually enhance their weapon technology, abilities and techniques by adapting from their hunt encounters and occasionally from their defeats. We don't see how they pass along such knowledge, but we can imagine they must have a communication method or a warrior, trade-secrets database, perhaps accessible from their technology.

Royce is also conflicted on the question. But the Predators are not. The Predators have a warrior ethics and try to avoid turning the hunt into mindless slaughter. They don't always succeed and break their ethos regularly with many technological advantages, including advanced camouflage and energy beam weapons.

One of the best parts to the movie is its vision of the hunting preserve. It allows us to imagine the rules of the place and figure out how it works along with the characters. The action is fast paced and interesting, but it doesn't overwhelm the plot with forced action-stunt sequences; they mostly seem to arise out of the plot. It doesn't deliver a broad or intricate vision of the aliens, but as a rare plus it refuses to destroy some of the novel parts of its scenario after so lovingly putting them together. Usually anything alien from our social norms is prime target for destruction!

When I heard that there was a "predators" movie coming out i was obviously excited. I wasn't even born when Predator came out but was raised watching it and watching Schwarzenegger movies. So basically I was excited.

I'm not sure that I expected too much or just have seen too many movies. I watch all movies no matter the actors, budget, or the director. I didn't read any reviews before I saw the movie, the only thing i had heard was the basic plot (These people are hunters on planet Earth, the predators are the hunters on this planet, lets make a game and see who wins.) Plot sounds kinda boring but it had potential.

Overall I could have fallen asleep when I watched this movie. There was no excitement, no special effects and the acting was horrible. Basically the way the movie went was "oh crap were on this planet with these things. Well i don't want to die so I'll follow the tough guy and when time comes, I'll have someone else stay and die for me. (the last part went until there were only 3 people left.)" And after carefully reading some of the other reviews, I agree. Comparing the predator in the original to the predators in this movie, these predators look like a older man in a Predator Halloween costume. It was pathetic.

Only reason I gave this a three was because of the convict, he at least made a few good laughs in the movie. That was the only show of emotion the movie got from me. I jump easily during creepy or suspenseful parts but i didn't even flinch during this movie. In the end, I would not let someone pay me to waste another 2 hours to watch this movie.

I am a huge fan of the first Predator, I was a 7 year old kid when I saw it and will always love it.

This does not mean I expect every sequel to copy it.

So I am cool with Predator 2, they expanded on the story and even dared to make a connection with Alien.

AvP has my favorite scene in all of the franchise, the flashback of the ancient times when the Predators were worshiped as gods.

AvP2 was a horrible disappointment as I was expecting it to take place in the predator homeworld, but no, due to low budget it takes place in the US. At least it had a bold scene of the Predator homeworld.

Predators takes place in a really low budget environment because "Predator belongs in the jungle"... Why exactly I don't know.

This movie is very cheap and tries to steal moments of the first movie to gain value.

It's more about the characters than the predators and I really don't care about any of them, except the yakuza hit-man. At least he remakes the Indian's death from Predator 1 with style.

This movie should be called Nobodies instead of Predators.

There is nothing new about the predators in this film except that there is a new bigger meaner sect of them. Like the old ones failed for some reason or were fully covered and explored.

No imagination at all.

No budget.

An action movie with intelligent characters... what's Hollywood thinking!!

If you liked any of the previous predator movies this is a must see.

For me the thing I liked most was the lack of "Duh" moments.

It's a predator movie it isn't exactly realistic but for the most part every time something happens and you think to yourself "Here we go again another stupid Hollywood sequence" (movies where they run out of ammo and don't pick up a gun sitting right next to them always bugged the hell out of me) I was pleasantly surprised.

Maybe it's the touch of class Adrian Brody brings to all his movies cause every time you expect something stupid to happen his character does the opposite. He does what you'd expect someone in his situation to do.

They are special forces commandos surely they would conserve ammo and not blow it all on the first thing that twitches?... Check

Alice Braga's character tells them how to hide from the predators why aren't they all running around covered in mud?... Check (a bit late though)

Running head first into really obvious traps?... Check

Ultimate Hardass comes to help them risking his own neck purely out of the goodness of his heart?... Check

It's this intelligent directing that really sold the movie for me. 

It draws you in. You start putting yourself in their shoes thinking "what would I do in that situation? How could you possibly overcome such a formidable enemy?" This really made all the difference for me anyway.

My only real criticism is that the doctor's plot line was a a little cliché at the end. It's a combat unit and he's the medic it doesn't need any more explanation. I didn't agree he was out of place. That and the jungle could of looked a fraction more "Alieny". Pretty Minor stuff really.

I honestly can't remember the last time I've seen an action movie this engaging.

Let's hope it sets a trend for the future.

Now if only there was a 3D version.

Edit: Most of the criticism's of this movie seem to be people who go into a movie titled "PREDATORS" and expect something else. Of course it's a guy movie. Of course it keeps a lot of the old Predator themes.

First of all, I've seen the first Predator at least a hundred times. I could re-enact the whole thing right in front of you. I've seen it so many times, I even watched it once in Spanish with French sub-titles. And with the way Hollywood seems to rape all the things I hold dear (i.e. transformers, AVP, G.I Joe, etc.) I was really hoping I wouldn't leave the theater crying or punching the wall. This is the first time in a while I've actually gone to the theater more than once to see the same movie and it has, for me, stood up to multiple viewings. Sure there's holes in the plot (how can everybody know English?) but I don't think it deserves some of the trashing it gets here. I guess I like how there really are no "good guys" in this movie since everybody in it is a ruthless killer. I did find that the new 'super' predators were a little unnecessary-- sort of the angry africanized bees of the predators-- but I can live with it. I really can't believe the Expendables gets a better rating than this, now THAT'S an abomination!!

Not perfect, but not the abomination I was expecting.
