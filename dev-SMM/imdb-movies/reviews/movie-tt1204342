### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to start a review, but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies, but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It's an absolutely life-affirming tribute to beloved characters and memories that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity, and if you care at all about movies you need to see this, as soon as possible. 

Jason Segel, along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams with affection towards the Muppets, and that love and passion has instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes to long history of Muppet shows, movies, and even viral videos. The film is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and accomplishes this without being crass or cynical; it's smart, witty, and most importantly, completely heartfelt. Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself. 

The original Muppet Movie will always be a timeless classic, and it's charm and legacy will likely never be topped by another Muppet movie. However, The Muppets is the closest it has ever come, and, due to the timeliness and poignancy of the story, I would argue that right at this moment it is more relevant and moving than even the 1979 classic. I was unable to stop smiling during the entire running time of the movie, even while tears were coming to my eyes. 

I know I'm not really reviewing the movie right now, and I'm more just beaming about how much I loved it, but really, I feel it would be a disservice to go into details about this movie. Simply put, you need to see it, and if you don't you're robbing yourself of a truly extraordinary film experience. This is the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational movie of the year. Go see it. Right now. I mean it, go buy tickets for this weekend, and you can thank me later.

"The Muppets" plays the music and lights the lights, but it's not sensational, inspirational, celebrational, or even muppetational, and that's the most disappointing thing of all. What we have are two movies vying for the same space, neither emerging victorious because they're not handled particularly well. On the one hand, we have a soppy, innocuous love story between Jason Segel and Amy Adams, which is occasionally interrupted by musical numbers that have plenty of singing and dancing but hardly any life. On the other hand, we have the Muppets themselves, which would be fine except that they're almost completely reduced to background scenery and aren't given anything much to do. For all the effort that was put into the sets, the costumes, the special effects, and of course the puppetry, the film lacks the imagination and heart that made most of the previous Muppet films so enjoyable.

In the earlier efforts, human actors were essentially supporting players. The filmmakers had enough sense to let the stories unfold from the perspective of the Muppets, all of whom were allowed to develop as characters. This is not the case with this film, which gives ample time to Segel and Adams. They play Gary and Mary, a wholesome, sunny couple from the all-American hamlet of Smalltown, where the population number on the welcome sign fluctuates due to the buses crossing the city limits. Much of the film is spent on their being deeply in love  and, of course, on the circumstances that test their emotional fortitude. We know right from the start that their relationship is silly, but the real problem is that it's also unnecessary. It doesn't help that neither Segel nor Adams gives a noteworthy performance. Adams in particular is surprisingly out of place, spending most of her time mugging girlishly.

For their tenth anniversary as boyfriend and girlfriend, Gary decides to take Mary on a trip to Los Angeles. Along for the ride is Gary's brother, Walter, who, for reasons wisely left unexplained, is a puppet (performed by Peter Linz). Mary doesn't mind ... as long as Gary makes time for a romantic dinner. Naturally, Walter is not seeing this from their perspective. Being only three feet tall and made of foam, he always felt like an outsider. He found solace only in watching "The Muppet Show," and in due time, he because the Muppets' biggest fan. His sole purpose in joining Gary and Mary is to take a tour of the Muppet Theater in Hollywood (take note, Angelinos: The Muppet Theater is actually the El Capitan  which, incidentally, is where I saw this movie). It turns out to be a shadow of its former self, a dilapidated tourist attraction no one is interested in.

In due time, Walter overhears the wealthy Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who says he wants to turn the theater into a Muppet museum but has in fact discovered oil underneath and plans on taking it all for himself. The only possible way to save the theater, as stipulated by the Rich and Famous contract Kermit the Frog signed in 1979, is if Kermit raises $10 million by a certain date. And so Walter, Gary, and Mary find Kermit (performed by Steve Whitmire), who now lives in an old, decaying mansion in Bel Air. He decides that his only hope is to track down the rest of the Muppets and, in the tradition of the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney backyard musicals, put on a show. But is such a thing possible? As a TV executive (Rashida Jones) eventually makes abundantly clear, the Muppets just aren't popular anymore. Under her orders, they must have a celebrity host.

We see some of the Muppets being found. Fozzie (performed by Eric Jacobson) performs in Reno with a mean tribute band called the Moopets, Animal (again Jacobson) is undergoing anger management, Gonzo (performed by Dave Goelz) has become a successful plumbing tycoon, and Miss Piggy (Jacobson yet again) has made a life for herself in Paris as the editor of "Vogue" magazine. The rest are gathered during a montage. What bothers me is that just about none of the Muppets are given their fair share of screen time; they're not characters, but objects for the audience to point at and recognize nostalgically. The only exceptions are Kermit and Miss Piggy, and even then something is missing. For the first time in their decades of being paired together, they have absolutely no chemistry.

Like most Muppet movies, we're treated to a slew of celebrity cameos. These would include Jack Black, Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Whoopi Goldberg, John Krasinski, Selena Gomez, Zach Galifianakis, Rico Rodriguez, Jim Parsons, Judd Hirsh, Emily Blunt, and Dave Grohl. If you can think back to 1979's "The Muppet Movie," you'll recall that all of the guest stars were given more to do than flash their faces for a star-crazy audience. They played actual characters. Remember Steve Martin as the irritated waiter? I can count on one hand the guest stars in "The Muppets" who are given a purpose and are developed into anything resembling a personality. There's no reverence, only hype and a lot of one-note jokes. "The Muppets" may find an audience through its harmless tone, bright colors, and broad humor, but its thin plot, shoddy soundtrack, and badly developed characters are unlikely to appease die-hard Muppet fans  or anyone in need of a good story.

The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I don't just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on  it was clever, entertaining, adorable, heartwarming, and absolutely hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases everybody -- average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike, and that I believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy, chock full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing their favorite puppets reunite for another big show, literally.

Funnily enough, the movie treats the Muppet characters as if they were real life actors, with The Muppets shows and movies being their past careers. The Muppets haven't seen any action in years (a fact also true in real life), and each muppet has taken his/her own path in life with varying degrees of success. When crisis arises, the old troupe is forced to find each other and give it another go.

It is all weaved through a fascinating metanarrative that begs the question, what happens to the Muppets when they aren't The Muppets? After all this time away, can The Muppets make a comeback through a reunion and relive their former glory days?  a question ultimately answered by the movie itself. 

The film opens with a common puppet named Walter, whose childhood consists of watching The Muppets and dreaming of joining them. His older brother Gary (Jason Segel) extends the invitation to come with him and his girlfriend of 10 years Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles so that he can visit the Muppet studio. Much to his disappointment, the Muppet theater is abandoned and Walter even overhears an oil tycoon's (Chris Cooper) plot to tear down the place. Walter and Gary quickly seek out Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppet crew and remedy the situation, but all the while Mary is upset that the turn of events is ruining her 10 year anniversary with Gary.

As you can imagine from the premise alone, the movie is a tribute to the Muppets in every sense. It travels respectfully through the old Muppet history, and relives it instead of trying to replace it. In fact, seeing how each one branched off from the group like members of an old band and "grew up" gave, I would say, substantially more character to each Muppet than they ever had before. I think fans will agree that this is the best possible way the muppets could have returned.

Simply put, I can't imagine anyone with a heart not enjoying this film. There's something in it for everybody, especially if you're in the mood for laughter and catchy musical numbers. The creative humor was a breath of fresh air. There is plenty breaking of the fourth wall and oh so much of that lovely deadpan irony and absurdist humor, reminiscent of old comedies like Airplane! The audience in the theater was cracking up almost every other moment, myself included. And while humor is its strong suit, the movie is also an incredibly heartwarming tale of friends that go their separate ways but are still connected through their hearts. Moviegoers and Muppet fans alike, go see this movie!

There are very few of us twenty-somethings who grew up without the Muppets. Between Sesame Street, Muppet Show reruns, and videocassettes of the various Muppet movies, we saw these guys all the time. We even had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the '90s. (My personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is still annual holiday viewing.) In recent years, since the very underwhelming Muppets from Space, we've seen them pop up now and again, mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short (yet hilarious!) YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that, in this newest movie, the Muppets are back in a big way! 

The movie starts by introducing us to a new Muppet, Walter, and his strangely human brother Gary. Gary has planned a trip with his girlfriend, Mary, to Los Angeles, and he is taking Walter along to visit the home of his heroes, Muppet Studios. They find the studio to be in disrepair, and hear of an evil plot to destroy it. Can the Muppets, and everything we hold dear about them, be saved? To get my one complaint out of the way, I do feel that this movie was a bit rushed in places. I wanted more time with these awesome characters, and it did feel as if they were trying to get from one place to the next a bit too quickly.

That said, I spent nearly the entire movie with a smile on my face. These are the Muppets that I grew up with, doing what they are best at doing, with that gently edgy humor at which they have always excelled. While there are some moments that are very touching, it is mostly very funny, with lots of nods to The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie. While new little Muppet fans should enjoy this, it will be much more meaningful to those who have a history with Kermit and Co.

Clearly made with love for Jim Henson and his creations of fur and felt, The Muppets is the most delightful movie I've seen in theaters this year.

I wasn't raised on Barbie dolls, or cartoons. I wasn't in love with Duck Tales or The Secret of Nimh (in fact it scared me senseless), but I was raised to love The Muppets. Fozzie the Bear was a safe old friend who always cheered me up, Kermit was my sense of justice and reason, Miss Piggy was an exercise in the unrestrained Id, Gonzo was something I didn't and still don't understand, but he's blue and adorable! The Muppets are incredibly precious to me. And I just LUCKED out, because the newest Muppet movie was made by a fan who took all of that into account and made a film that just celebrated the glory of the Muppets. Sure there were moments of overkill, sure it sometimes got ridiculous, but The Muppets is about more than just the Muppets. It's about yearning for something pure; something innocent without patronizing its audience. This film was really clever, self aware with a great sense of humor with a giant heart. Definitely see it!

This was a disappointment.

On the good side  I couldn't tell it wasn't Frank Oz doing the voice of Miss Piggy, and there were some giggles to be had, and some interesting celebrity cameos. I won't spoil them, but there was some good fan service in the cameos.

On the bad side  Jason Segal. Frank Oz didn't want to be involved because of the horrible script, and I totally see his point. The movie isn't a Muppet Movie. It's a Jason Segal film, staring Jason Segal, produced by Jason Segal, written by Jason Segal, and utterly dominated by Jason Segal. Jason Segal takes up more than 50% of the film, which is horrible considering there were about 40 other more interesting characters all competing for the remaining 50% of screen time. I've never heard of him before and I never want to again. Jason Segal so utterly dominates the film that the Muppets themselves are reduced to mere cameo performances in the film.

With no Frank Oz the voice of Fozzy was just peculiar. Not only unrecognizable, but occasionally slipped into being a woman's voice. Weird.

The introduced character of Walter (basically, a Muppet clone of Jason Segal) is just not interesting. I didn't care about him at all, and hated the fact that his story dominated the Muppets to the point that we just don't get any story development about the Muppets themselves.

Amy Adams, usually entertaining, is so dominated by Jason Segal that her character has no reason to be other than as a romantic object for Jason Segal. She's a bit of a non-entity in the film, sadly.

When Jason Segal isn't on the screen, this film is quite good. Sadly, he wasn't off screen all that much.

For all of you who are wondering if this will even come close to capturing the magic of the original Muppet movie, I just have one thing to say to you: go see this movie!!!!! I was a little worried myself that this movie would not be great, but tonight, I gave it a chance. And I left with a smile on my face. :) The story is that Gary (Jason Segel), Mary (Amy Adams), and Walter (the new Muppet) decide to take a trip down to Los Angeles; Walter wants to see the Muppet studios, but Mary and Gary are going for their 10th year anniversary of dating. There, they discover the oil tycoon Tex Richman's (Chris Cooper) plan to tear down the Muppet theater. That's when they decide to get the Muppets gang back together, and to put on one last show to raise enough money to save the theater. I'll let you put two and two together now.

Warning: This just might be my longest review so far on this website. That's right: I loved this film so much that I have to ramble on and on about how much I love it.

Let me first start off with the behind-the-scenes work. Jason Segel, I applaud you. You believed in this movie more than anybody else, and it is why they trusted you, my man. Thank you so much for everything you have done on this film; the result is that kids are now laughing at the Muppets, while adults are reminiscing about the old days when Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and the rest would come into their TV's and bring laughter into their homes. Both generations are coming out with smiles on their faces. As for the rest of the crew, thank you so much for doing your job right. I am so happy that cgi and 3d was not used here, so thank you for not incorporating those elements.

Now, to the actors (the human actors). Jason Segel and Amy Adams are perfectly corny in this, but it works here, because it's the muppets! Their little story on the side was great; it was not overplayed, it was just right. I won't spoil what this side-story is, but trust me, you'll enjoy it. Chris Cooper was perfectly evil here. I would say that he was one of the most evil characters in the history of the Muppets, but even he gets a song in this movie.

Speaking of the songs, they are all so great and corny here. From the new songs, like "Life's a Happy Song," to the great old ones, like (yes, you are hearing this right) "The Rainbow Connection." They even have the celebrities in this movie singing "Mahna Mahna" in the credits. Loved every bit of it.

And finally, the stars themselves: the Muppets. The trailers did emphasize Jason Segel and Amy Adams, but make no mistake, this is a Muppet film, and the whole entire gang was back. Kermit is still the normal Muppet trying to pull it all together, Fozzie still has a bad sense of humour, Miss Piggy is still very selfish, Gonzo is still trying to perform dangerous stunts, Animal still plays the drums, Rowlf still plays the piano, and all the others are doing their thing. But, let's not forget the newest addition to this wonderful gang: Walter. If you guys are wondering if whether or not he is worth watching, guess what, he is worth it! He is a really likable character, who grew up watching the muppets, and therefore has found them to be his place in life. He is a very nice addition to the family, and I welcome him aboard.

Simply put, I can't stress on how great this film is. Forget about Twilight; The Muppets is where it's at! Everything about this film is great! Honestly, I don't know why Frank Oz said that he felt like this film did not focus on character development of the Muppets. Um Frank, I believe that the Muppets have been around for around 35 years now; I don't think they need that much more character development. Simply put, this movie is great. Kids will love the Muppets, and Adults will remember why they loved the muppets when they were growing up. My only complaint is that this movie should have been longer, but that's barely a complaint, since I enjoyed the movie so much that I will give it a 10/10. That's right, a 10/10 for me! Welcome back, muppets!

The Muppets brought a generation of youngsters (myself included) out of Sesame Street and into a world where they didn't feel like airhead children any longer.

With THE MUPPET MOVIE, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy and the gang discovered each other on a cross-country adventure that was a true odyssey. But here we've mentally gone back to Sesame Street with some silly sing-alongs, flat jokes, and an unexciting journey out of a small town where resides Jason Segel, his school teacher girlfriend, and a puppet named Walter who loves watching  and relating to  the original TV series.

They decide to take a trip to the Muppet studio, but it's but a wasteland. And here they discover a greedy oilman wants to turn the dilapidated theater into his very own goldmine.

The trio find a melancholy Kermit and they head off to collect the remaining group throughout America and Europe. Thus the road trip begins, which could have (should have) taken most of the film like the original, but it's but a fifteen-minute rushed romp where not much happens, leading to a big show where the Muppets have to raise ten million dollars to save their studio.

The Muppets themselves are all present, but they don't do much nor are they individually vital to the story  but then again, there's not much of a story to begin (or end) with.

The fundraiser itself is a rushed montage of skits lacking what The Muppet Show had in creativity and humor. As for star/producer Jason Segel, whose effort to get the classic icons all back in one movie has merit, the result is too banal for what these characters, and their audience (old and young), truly deserve.

And the entire film centers on the long-lost nostalgia of the Muppets during the late seventies/early eighties, forgetting all the movies made after the death of Jim Henson, which might have explained their departure. But perhaps Segel wanted to only remember the golden era; it's too bad he failed to recreate it.

While the "We Built This City" number really stands out amongst a few others in capturing the essence of classic Muppets, overall Jason Segel and his puppet creation Walter simply wear out their welcome. Jason Segel (Gary) and Walter (Gary's 'brother') usurp/upstage and prevent the Muppets from rightfully ever taking center stage, as opposed to eventually settling in and complimenting Jim Henson's life work. At some point the film stopped being The Muppets and more so The Jason Segel & Walter Movie, featuring the Muppets. This awkwardly overbearing sentiment was cemented in one of the (borderline self congratulatory) final scenes of the film, where Segel's new 'reluctant' hero Walter is lifted up by the 'thankful' Muppets, the image on screen is brought to a still and framed in black and white...

Whatever the motives were, the resulting film begins with a 'tired' Kermit who never seems to become fully rejuvenated by films end, and a Fozzie who is... a 'fuzzy' figment from Reno of his former self. Additionally, neither of the two aforementioned lead Muppet characters is appropriately voice cast. For the sake of full character comparison (voice, mannerisms, personality, role, etc.), please take the time to watch (or re-watch) one (or a few) of the films this one is supposedly intended to capture the spirit of/pay homage to (in addition to the original show itself, of course!) such as The Muppet Movie (1979), The Great Muppet Caper (1981), or even The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). Had the Muppets really become that pathetic? Were they really long since forgotten and discarded to the ash heap of history, only to be saved with a guest-starring role by Jason Segel (who's passionate about both puppeteering and writing, granted, but is a little hard to actually connect with on screen...) and his puppet creation Walter? Or is this more possibly a case of initial good intention having crossed the line into a wee bit too much self indulgence and become a vehicle for a little (ok, a lot of) self promotion? Unfortunately, it seems the answer to that question is the latter.

I have been a huge fan of the Muppets for decades. Somewhere Jim Henson is turning in his grave or should be. This is just awful. 

The most immediate criticism that comes to mind is reduced to one word, pacing. This drags like a corpse through the slowest zombie apocalypse movie ever made and as much as you hope it will pick up the pace, you cannot eventually help hoping that someone will put this zombie to rest with a quick head shot. 

I wanted to like this movie. After all, how can you go wrong with Muppets, right? You expect formula, maudlin music to tell us how we're supposed to be feeling, and incongruous shots of glee in the midst of a terrible situation that you know will somehow be fixed in the last reel. You hope for better, but you know how the predictable sells, but this? 

This is a movie that didn't know what it was. It could have been - emphasis could have been - a meaningful yet light and entertaining criticism of being left behind and forgotten. You know like the middle class people who used to have enough income to waste money buying tickets and renting videos for movies like this. Instead we get a feel good, Capitalist fueled commentary about combating cynicism.

Amazingly, there is also bitterness painted over as humor. Miss Piggy and Amy Adams' Mary have men who've done 'em wrong. They weave as much "I am woman hear me whine" mono-normativity and passive aggressive co- dependence as you might expect from a 1950s advice column white gloves included. It sends the wrong message to young women; and the tacit expectation that men should tow the line and give them whatever they want no matter what they might want is simply appalling. It has NO business in a movie that children might see. 

The one ray of hope in the movie was Chris Cooper whose acceptably obvious-sounding character Tex Richman (Rich Man, get it?) provided a little Scrooge-esque energy to this latter day Christmas Carol (sans Christmas of course). Those hopes were quickly dashed, though, as he managed an even more puppet like performance than his co-stars. 

The one legitimately funny moment of the film came when the gang caught up with drummer, Animal, at an anger management meeting. I won't spoil it, but watch out for it, because it produced the only giggle in two hours. 

Cameos were dismal and apparent from an early appearance of Mickey Rooney to Zach Galifianakis' Hobo Joe to his Hangover co-star Ken Jeong. The sole bright spot among the also-ran list was Jim Parsons as Human Walter. Maybe they'll let him come back in some future installment and actually show people how funny movies are supposed to be made.

I only have two thumbs but if I had more I would give this ten thumbs down.

It's difficult not to get swept up by the hype of the first theatrically-released Muppet movie in 12 years. The preview trailers have been going viral since this past summer, and the Muppets & their human co-stars have been hitting the talk show circuit like never before. Audiences who don't catch on to this Muppet fever will be missing a refreshingly entertaining movie.

"The Muppets" lives up to most of its hype. It's a solid, stand-alone movie with a great storyline. While the film may be considered a tribute, which in many ways it is, very rarely does a tribute make a great movie. Any TV show can put the Muppets on proverbial pedestals using archive footage. "The Muppets" succeeds by breathing new life into characters we've known for years, and bringing them back down from their high pedestals so they're easier to see.

It really takes a Muppet fanatic to reintroduce these classic characters about whom the movie alleges everyone forgot. In the movie, that fanatic is Walter, who is himself a Muppet that the world treats like a human being, albeit a very short human being. When Walter accompanies his best friend and roommate Gary (Jason Segel) and his longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles, Walter's ultimate goal is to take a tour of the famed Muppet theater. He soon finds that the theater's glory days are long gone, and the Muppets themselves have since gone their separate ways.

In reality, it's Jason Segel who is the Muppet fanatic. Segel co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Stoller (director of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" (2008)), and also served as executive producer. He does a good job acting in the movie, knowing precisely when to take a step back and have the film's real stars take center stage. As a screenwriter, he also allows virtually every classic Muppet to have their screen time, as the Muppets are brought together the same way Jake and Elwood reunited the old band in "The Blues Brothers" (1980). Each character's appearance reminds us why they were so revered way back in "The Muppet Show" days.

The plot involving a Texas oilman wanting to demolish the Muppet theater because there is oil underneath has been done before, but Chris Cooper, as villain Tex Richman, lives up to his clever name. He's funny while also being a convincing villain. He performs a rap number (yes, Chris Cooper raps) that is desultory, but amusing if only for its randomness.

If the thought of Cooper rapping alone makes you cringe, there are plenty of other highly original songs that will wash out that memory quickly. All the songs, most of which were written by Bret McKenzie (one half of the band/comedy duo, Flight Of The Conchords), are well-written. My favorite was "Man or Muppet", sung by Segel and Walter, which was funny and poignant.

"Pictures In My Head", sung by Kermit, is also surprisingly touching, with Kermit's walking through a hallway of Muppet paintings adding to the sentiment. It could rank as the best Muppet movie song since "Together Again" from "The Muppets Take Manhattan" (1984). The aforementioned songs, and perhaps even "Life's a Happy Song", have strong possibilities to be nominated for Best Original Song at the upcoming Academy Awards.

With all these original tunes, it's a wonder why they wasted precious royalty money on the terrible Starship song "We Built This City". Alas, this is the chosen song the Muppets sing while renovating the Muppet theater. 

While the songs add heart to a movie that makes the term "franchise reboot" seem too myopic, the movie would not be worth watching if it was not funny. Fortunately, most of the Muppet gags are gut-bustingly hilarious. Some gags are self-referential with characters breaking the fourth wall without even have to look at the camera. Others are the zany gags you'd expect from seeing "The Muppet Show", but are clever and hilarious too.

While the trailers had their share of recent movie parodies, the film fortunately eases up on them. There's one reference to "Kill Bill", but it's slight and capricious. I also laughed at the 80's Robot.

All the classic Muppet characters make their mark in ways they haven't done since "The Muppet Christmas Carol" (1992), the last great Muppet movie. The few newer Muppets that are allocated screen time happen to shine, fortunately. Walter is a great new Muppet, and has a lot of heart of which the late Jim Henson would whole-heartedly approve.

Dozens of celebrity cameos abound here, but the film's strength is knowing who the real stars of the movie are and why we love them. I just hope younger audience members get the same message.

I did not find anything in this movie. Nothing in this movie, no comedy, no fun, no story. Just garbage. Do not waste your time and money to it. I went with my 5 years old daughter, She was very excited to watch this movie, but at the end of the show she was more disappointed than me. No real story at all, no emotions no, no comedy. Thanks god that I did not take my wife with me, that would waste another $12 bucks from my pocket for nothing. I would not recommend anybody to watch this movie in theater.

Watch TV in home, save your money. Or help someone else but do not waste on this movies.

I am a little bit very disappointed in that Segel Muppets movie. And he was so devoted to the 'original' Muppets creativity in his interview. The problem is, the movie spent way too much time on bad tacky musical moments. Bad tacky, not just tacky, but purposefully bad, chosen to be bad but done anyways while making jokes in the middle of it about it being bad songs. When they finally got to the Muppets stage performances all the stuff was mediocre, as if that part of the movie was written as an afterthought. Don't get me wrong, I am still a kid at heart and have an appreciation for fine immature humor but there was very little of that going around in The Muppets 2011. Lame immature humour was more like it. I got way more laughs watching 2 minutes of the Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody clip. This movie contains not one good Swedish Chef joke. Any Muppets fan I know can spontaneously spew a Swedish Chef moment, just give em an axe and prop chicken. The 'celebrity host' was nothing more than an unwilling prop. The ma-nah-ma-na card was played in lame fashion. The old farts did not even have opportunity to make sarcastic puns and jokes because there were hardly any acts to joke on. Everyone had a bit part while the screen time was gobbled up with lame song and dance bits. AND to top it off the final act just plain sucked. Some man-kid ordinary Muppet discovering his inner talent? Lame! Though if that performance was real in the sound booth that was some damn good @#$%&! ....or maybe it was the $6 small bag of popcorn that got me irked...

Before reading this review you should know that I've never watched a muppet movie, so this is the first one, nor the muppet show and that I've only watched the muppets on "Sesame Street". I would say that they're lovely and also that I enjoyed them. Well the thing is that I went to watch the movie to the movie theatre and I really thought it would be funny or at least as "Sesame Street". I went with my sisters and my mother, I really had good expectations. When the movie began and I was reading the credits I started to worry when I noticed that the movie had been written by Jason Segel. Then the movie began with that annoying puppet named Walter. At first sight the movie seemed boring and I said to myself "Let's give it a chance, maybe it gets better when the muppets appear". I was wrong because all the muppets appeared and the movie was still boring and ridiculous. I don't care what people think this movie is so boring, my mother and my sister fell asleep and I was almost about to and even my 9-year-old sister was kind of mad and bored. I really don't understand what you find funny or charming about the movie.

On the other hand the stars seem to be Jason Segel, his dumb replica Walter and of course the ridiculous and boring Amy Adams not The Muppets as it should be. I really got disappointed because I thought it would be lots of fun but instead it was boring and simple. I just can remember myself watching the movie at the chair with my hands on my face sad, mad and bored.

Ouch!

As I write this, The Muppets (2011) is rated 8.3 while the original The Muppet Movie (1979) is 7.5 and The Muppet Christmas (1992) is 7.4. This third installment is by far the poorest of the three. Henson would be rolling in his grave.

Was it really wise to alienate the traditional Muppet fan-base with a plot that, in essence, says, "Grow up! Be a Man! You are too old for the Muppets." While, at the same time, providing a story so cheesy and useless that new young fans were bored to death in the seats. The only laughs (the third most important thing after having kids and something else) I saw from my 10-year old daughter were during the short, perhaps 10 minutes, that the movie simulated an actual Muppet Show.

The movie is filled with jokes that go beyond self-deprecation to insulting. The attempt at turning it into a "musical" falls on a flat note with some of the worst songs you've seen since . . . well, since this movie. To actually include a scene with a kid punching his teacher in the "Punch Teacher" show in a Muppet production is unthinkable. If you didn't stay through the credits, you wouldn't even know that the Muppets still retained their theater after using physical violence to pull it off ("Oh, well! At least we tried" says Kermit to reassure his crew and cast).

Are the main-line critics just to scared of Disney or the Muppet franchise to really say what they feel in their reviews? From the reviews, one would think this is the best movie of the year. It is even more surprising that some of the fan reviews put up 10s and 9s. Either I'm totally out of it, or we really have gone downhill.

My recommendation . . . save your $12.00+ ticket price per person, $25+ food bill, and buy the DVD in the WalMart clearance bin for $2.99 in a few months.

I now have to go watch The Muppet Movie to get my sanity back . . . what a waste.

As an enormous fan of the Muppets, this movie has been long anticipated! As a fan of Jason Segel, I had very high hopes an expectations! Jason said his goal for this movie was to bring back the spirit and the feeling of the original Muppet Movie and the Muppet Show. If that's true, then I'm afraid he failed on pretty much every level.

This was NOT a Muppet movie. This was a love letter from Jason, to the Muppets. None of the characters were themselves. The mood was completely off. All but two of the many musical numbers were dry, pointless, unfeeling, and out-of-place. 

The film actually started out great with the plot to raze the Muppet Studios causing The Muppets to reunite and put on a show - but the love affair between Jason Segel and Amy Adams' characters took up too much screen time and basically pushed the Muppets aside. 

I was very disappointed in this movie. Even Muppets from Space was better than this. Its no wonder Frank Oz turned down the "opportunity" to direct the film. And its also obvious why Steve Whitmire wanted his name removed from the credits. This movie was laaaaaammmmmeeeeeeee.

Let me open by saying that I definitely give credit to Jason Segel for his efforts in trying to bring the Muppets back. I was really pulling for you and this film...big time. In the end, I just couldn't bring myself to think positively about this film. Here's why...

- First of all, this is the first Muppet movie where the Muppets aren't the stars. Not only that, it's not filmed from their perspective. Let's face it, who really cares about Segel's character and the relationship with Amy Adams? This is a Muppet movie. Let the movie be about them. If Segel really wanted to bring the Muppets back, he would have stepped to the side and let them shine.

- Way too much cheese. What is up with the high brow, cheesy pun-like songs? Segel looks at the camera and sings songs like a Saturday Night Live skit. Is he making fun of the movie? Is he just too overly excited? There's a level of (dare I say it?) integrity to the Muppets that is deeply missing in the movie. The Muppets always were able to blend in with the human world seamlessly without drawing too much attention to the fact that they were, well.. Muppets. The line is very much more defined in this movie.

- It doesn't feel like a Muppet movie. All the old voices/puppeteers are either dead or were not involved with the movie. I'm not just talking about how bad the new voices are (some of that can't be helped) but the way the Muppets moved and interacted as Muppets. To me it was as if the original puppeteers stopped, put all the Muppets down, and then a whole bunch of new people picked them up and did their own interpretation of how the Muppets should act. The result? You get Muppets you don't recognize. Not only that, it makes you sad because you wonder where they went. There was hardly a trace of the Kermit we all came to know and love in this movie. Same goes for Fozzie. Instead of feeling like close friends you love, they felt like strangers to me.

The movie wasn't all bad. Walter was a very endearing new character and really added to the story. All of the elements were there. They just weren't executed the right way.

I think it all goes back to my first point. The Muppets were the supporting cast in this movie. Everything just falls apart as a result of that.

For those of us who remember the original Muppets, this movie will be like a stab in the back to you. Disney, who now own the Muppets, have created yet another dreary movie with little or no storyline and poor additional characters all covered in a thick layer of sickly Disney gloss. So many of the Muppet characters were woefully under used or just weren't used at all!. Instead far to much time was given to song and dance numbers which didn't involve the Muppets nearly enough, and the insanely spotlight hogging lead lady, who it has to be said is not nearly as good as she seems to think she is. To boot loads of the Muppets, like Kermit and especially Fozzy Bear don't sound anything like they should do. I realise that new actors would have to have been drafted in for this, but surely they could at least make sure they sounded right before filming? The scene with Jack Black & Animal in anger management had potential but never achieved it. Overall a very disappointing movie, with Disney riding roughshod over what and who the Muppets are. Avoid.

Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my childhood. I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.

This was the best Muppet Movie since 1981's The Great Muppet Caper, which is saying a lot, because I hold that film in very high regard.

The Muppets have been rather hit and miss since Jim Henson passed away. The Muppet Show was originally started by Henson and Oz as a more adult oriented, yet still family friendly comedy variety show as an outlet for gags and bits that wouldn't work on Sesame Street. It worked too, both kids and adults loved the show, and the first three films are classics in their own right. But, sometime in the 80s, The Muppets started to cater more towards Kids rather than adults. The Muppet Babies were first introduced in the third feature film which eventually spawned its own series. Henson then sold the franchise to Disney and sadly died shortly thereafter. It seems that, after the success of Muppet Babies, Disney decided to continue to move The Muppets in a more kid oriented direction ... one with a decidedly Disney flavor to it. This didn't really help the Muppets legacy in the long term. Kids grow up, and eventually grow out of kid shows and movies. And with very little, if any, appeal to adult audiences, The Muppets were soon forgotten by the generation who grew up in the 90s and 2000s.

But the generation that that grew up in the 70s and 80s had not forgotten the old Muppets, in fact they missed them dearly. Jason Segel is one of those people, and it is clear from this film that his enduring love of The Muppets and the influence they had on him as a child, was the driving force behind this movie.

This is a comeback movie. The Muppets start off in a bad way. People have forgotten them, their abandoned studio is about to be torn down, and they just aren't popular anymore. This is reflecting the actual situation The Muppets franchise was in at the time they were making the movie. And thus the plot lends itself to fourth wall jokes that were so prevalent in the early films.

It is, for the most part, a return to form. This is old school muppet humor at its best. You have the silly and catchy musical numbers, mixed in with a bit of sincere songs, celebrity cameos, fourth wall jokes, pop culture humor, a self aware plot that frequently pokes fun at itself, Fozzie's bad jokes, Statler and Waldorf's heckling, a Kermit and Miss Piggy romance plot, and just general wackiness and slapstick.

Still, as similar as it is to the old Muppet formula, it's also quite different. After Disney took over, human characters often played larger roles in the Muppet films. That is the case with this one. In fact, much of the plot and humor in this film is not centered around the muppets at all, but are centered around the two human characters and the new muppet. While some may be disappointed by this change, I have to disagree and say that, for this film, it works and works quite well. Still, it's clear that Disney doesn't have much confidence in The Muppets holding the film together on their own, like they did in the original (and best) Muppet Movie.

As a result there are times where the movie feels less like a Muppet Movie and more like a tribute to the Muppets. In some ways this is the film's strength, in other cases it is a weakness. Also, some of the bits in the second half seem a bit awkward and fall flat, often on purpose, but usually it isn't worth the payoff. Nevertheless, this film hits on an emotional and nostalgic level, especially for those who grew up with The Muppets. There were times when I actually felt a tear come to my eye. It's that moving.

The film's success so far has been warranted, and I'm hopeful that Disney will do the right thing and green light "The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made", a project Henson and Oz had been pushing for since 1985. There were even plans to make it in 2009, but the project was set aside for this film instead. Hopefully, this last idea by Jim Henson will be the next sequel, the premise certainly looks like it has potential.

"If you're going to see The Muppets you've got to seem them in the theater." "Yeah, you don't want to let 'em into your home!" - Statler and Waldorf.

For the last two months of attending films an ad has preceded each movie. Instead of the obligatory "please don't spoil the movie by adding your own soundtrack" narration a cute, lively, spontaneous Muppet skit was shown where Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy were trying to attend a peaceful movie with the remainder of the Muppet characters making loud and disruptive noises. At the end, the quote above was said by Statler and Waldorf, and it will forever sum up my thoughts on the film.

To effectively experience the rambunctious Muppets, you should see their liveliness in the theater. It seems a screen as big as a theater's can't contain their actions. But I'm sure that once The Muppets hits DVD and Blu-Ray many parents will be forced to watch the film again and again on replay. It's a better choice than Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Zookeeper for sure.

The Muppets is an extremely self-aware revival to a franchise that will never die. Jason Segal, who also worked on the screenplay of the film, clearly is a super-fan of the movies and the Television series and wanted to give the series a much needed return to the big screen. He doesn't try to parody the formula or rework it in any way, but instead glide along with it in hopes of achieving the best film possible. He doesn't put his usual goofball spin on his character he's done in the past.

Set in Smalltown, USA, Gary (Segal) lives with his Muppet-brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) and is dating the lovely and adorable Mary (Adams). Walter has grown up with Gary for years, and is one of the biggest Muppet fans of all time (which leads me to believe he is reflecting Segal's personal love for The Muppets). Upon going to The Muppet Theater, Walter overhears Statler, Waldorf, and Tex Richman (Cooper) discussing plans to sell the theater to Tex. But Tex is secretly planning to tear down the theater and drill for oil underneath it.

So the only plausible situation in Walter's head is to talk to Kermit the Frog who appears in a glowing light at the nic of time and convince him to reunite the old Muppet crew to put on a Telethon. Then they're off getting back every character in creative and inventive ways.

In the time of gimmicky and useless 3D madness leaching onto every children's films, here is a movie that doesn't believe it should subject itself to dimming its colors and its actions just to garner in a higher revenue. The Muppets are such an eclectic and effervescent bunch that the 2D world can handle them perfectly fine.

There are a few things that I noticed here and there. The main one is definitely the voices. If you're a Muppet fan, you may be disappointed to notice that voices like Kermit the Frog aren't on par with the voices from the series and the previous films. Still, it doesn't take long before you forget that fact. Also, the lack of cameos astounds me. There are quite a few, but the ones "edited for time constraints" like Danny Trejo, Mila Kunis, Ricky Gervais, George Clooney, Lady Gaga sounded fun and enlightening, but also limitless in possibilities. Of course we do get pleasant cameos like Zach Galifianakis, Jack Black, and Alan Arkin, but it feels like that for once the cameo portion wasn't focused on a lot like in previous Muppet films.

I also have to say I was a little disappointed that popular Muppet characters like Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, after all these years, still gets brought to the foreground leaving many secondary characters in search of a time to shine. One character that needed a musical number was the Swedish Chef, personally one of my favorite Muppets next to Statler and Waldorf. The Chef needed at least one musical number, but the film just incorporates him very vaguely and rarely. Along with other Muppet characters like Gonzo and Fozzie Bear.

There is still plenty here for amusement, and The Muppet character never cease to put a smile on your face whether you're old or young. Although targeted to families, I'm not sure many kids would "get" the references, but immediately dive into the bright colors in this unique world. I don't think the film really cares if you get the joke or not. I think the idea is just happy to be back on the screen one more time.

Starring: Jason Segal, Amy Adams, Jack Black, Zach Galifianakis, and Alan Arkin. Directed by: James Bobin.

In Disney's major release for the holiday season, they went with an old stand by, the Muppets, in a film simply called The Muppets. It's a strange blend of humor, nostalgia, and satire. Here we meet Walter, who we know just by looking at him is a little bit different. He is, well, for lack of a better word, a Muppet. The only thing is he is a Muppet living in the real world, and not, I stress not, a member of the Muppet gang. At a very young age he fell under their spell, through television and video rentals. Walter's dream was to walk through the studio that his beloved Muppet's walked through. He gets his chance to meet them when his brother Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) takes his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles.

Walter finds out that the Muppets aren't as popular as they used to be. He finds only remnants of the glory days in a dusty studio, but winds up uncovering a sinister plot intending to bury the Muppet franchise for good. With so much at stake, Walter goes to great lengths to find his idols and bring them back together. With the help of Gary, Amy, Kermit, Fozzie, and the rest of the gang, Walter sets in motion a reunion scenario where if the Muppets put on one last show they can raise enough money to stop the maniacal Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) from ending the Muppet's hopes of survival.

It's almost like The Blues Brothers, where if "the band" gets back together all will be saved. The only difference is that for the audience it's like a reunion, too. We haven't seen the Muppets together save for a few commercials and music videos here and there. I would be lying if I said I didn't get goosebumps seeing Gonzo with his chickens, or the Swedish Chef and his man-hands. Without even trying this film grabs you right in the heart, squeezing every ounce of childhood you have left in there.

It is really evident that Segel took the task of acting and, more importantly, writing, very seriously. His heart really comes through. He didn't want to do an injustice to the franchise that gave him so much pleasure as a youngster. It's as if he wrote Walter as a Muppetization of himself (which really comes through during one particular musical number). He follows the Muppet formula of combining cultural references with the power of celebrity and the importance of silliness and childlike inhibition.

Has any of the magic left the Muppets? I don't think so. I must admit that some of the story points were a bit ridiculous, and sometimes a little too on the nose (yes, I am aware that it was trying to be, but doing it too much becomes tedious). I wasn't entering the film expecting completely revamped Muppet style. It was by the book, aimed appropriately at both children and adults, without ever stepping too far in either direction.

The BIG question remains...now what? The whole point of the movie is to show that the Muppet's have basically become an afterthought. A fond memory that quickly fades. Will this film attract a slew of Muppet followers? Will there be another film? Television show? Who knows. The movie ends optimistically, but how could it not? The thought of a world without the Muppets is scary. It's nice knowing that somewhere Kermit and the gang are waiting for their next queue. To light the lights, put on make up, and all that jazz.

So go treat yourself to a little taste of your childhood. It will do the soul good.

I'm old enough that I never saw Kermit until I was 12 and was watching Sesame Street with my youngest brother in 1969. Loved The Muppet Show in the late '70s, and was reintroduced to Sesame Street with my daughter in the early '80s.

My husband and I were about the only adults without children in this afternoon's showing of The Muppet Movie. We loved almost every minute if it.

Like "Up," the first 10 minutes or so of this movie are both brilliant and touching. Any kid who felt at all like an outsider in childhood, and saw "his/her people" in another part of popular culture can relate to Walter.

There are loads of pop culture (especially about the '80s) and movie-making jokes throughout the movie. Teens and adults will probably appreciate them more than the kids did. The '80s Robot was a great concept!

The movie lags a little here and there - it steals a bit much from the "Blues Brothers" and "UHF" and the original "Muppet Movie." There was a little much toilet humor and vaudeville jokes were just too obscure for 2011.

However...

One thing I found especially interesting was what was amusing to the kids in the audience. The kids really didn't seem to like the singing (though I found the Chris Cooper rap a complete hoot). The funniest thing to the kids seemed to be the abrupt appearance of Jim Parsons near the end of the movie. "It's Sheldon!" even some very young kids were saying. But the kids got wicked antsy during Kermit's overly-long speech at the end.

On the whole, it's a cute, entertaining flick. Jason Segel and Amy Adams were both charming. But the movie was funnier when it was more subversive.

Instead of this being a Muppet movie with Jason Segel, this was a Jason Segel movie with the Muppets in a supporting role.

Very little original content including the Muppets; it continually referenced the classic The Muppet Movie in most of the scenes where Jason Segel wasn't the focus, which were few. A good portion of the film was centered on a Muppet Telethon with a bunch of very short guest cameos (mostly Disney franchise stars) and rehashing of old bits from the original TV show.

It's very telling that Frank Oz disliked the script Jason Segel wrote and refused to take part in production. I would love to read the Frank Oz script. I bet Disney rejected it because it would've cost more to produce.

I was sorely disappointed by this film, and so far, haven't seen the sequel...

Too much time spent on the human characters, and introducing a new Muppet? Sacrilege! It takes far too long to get them all together again, and when they are found, it speeds over all the back-story to focus on the humans again! I understand that they needed to re- establish the gang for a new audience, but it's like taking the legacy apart, and putting it back together again, only not very well...

A lot of the humour seemed juvenile and simplistic, not with the subversive, satirical edge that "The Muppet Show" mastered... You were watching adult material presented in a package that kids could also enjoy... Now, with the update, it felt more like it was pitched directly at kid-level...

I have similar reservations to those of Frank Oz... and if Frank Oz declines to be involved, then you know there's something amiss!
