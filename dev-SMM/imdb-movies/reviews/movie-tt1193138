### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Halfway through this movie I considered it an 8 out of 10 and decently spent money. The second half came as a big surprise. George Clooney let go of all his suave and let his eyes show fear and isolation that real people feel.

There were two things going on in this movie. On one end, we were looking at the people getting fired. On the other end, we were seeing the problems with Ryan's way of life. The interviews at the end with the people who lost their jobs explaining that it was family and support that brought them through bad times hit a perfect note for bringing both parts of the story together.

The title of this film literally explains what it is like to not know what aspects of your life are solid, such as a home or a significant other. Everything going on is simply up in the air. One day, what you thought was one way will turn out to be something else entirely.

Best of Reitman's three. Very much recommend it.

Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, George Clooney stars as corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham, who is hired to help ease the transition of long-term employees to the unemployment line across the country. Taking his job very seriously and loving the 290 days away from homethe only problem with that is the 70 days at home in his empty apartmenthis world gets turned upside-down when a young upstart in the company threatens to ground the company to fire people via the internet. Not standing for a change in his life, nor the chance for his life goal of total airline miles to end, ("Let's just say I have a number and I haven't hit it yet"), he goes on a mission to prove how personal his job is and how key a face to face meeting can be to talk down an emotionally unstable person and really do the victim a service in an otherwise horrible moment in his life. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game-changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up.

Clooney's Bingham is the loner businessman whose only relationships exist from random meetings with attractive females at the multiple airports he frequents. His wallet of plastic has become his lifebloodcredit cards from airlines that accumulate his mileage, hotel status perk cards that let him cut the disgruntled travelers and go straight to the front, and numerous room keys that never seem to be thrown out, causing him to always use more than one before finally opening his hotel suite's door. Detached from his family for years as the brother that exists but cannot be counted on for anything, he contemplates whether he should, or really wants to, attend his sister's weddingthe little girl of the family and someone he should have been involved with after the passing of their father. A series of style cramping incidents for him begins with a phone call from his other sister and the request to take a cardboard cutout of the happy couple, (Melanie Lynskey and Danny McBride, in a role that might actually show some nuance for a guy that usually flies by the cuff), and photograph it in front of famous places he travels to for work "like that French gnome movie,"I love the Amélie reference. Then comes the threat of being taken out of the air, his home for decades, in order to impersonally let go more people more efficiently; the challenge of taking Natalie on his next schedule of jobs to prove to her why the new system won't work; and the addition of a love interest in Vera Farmiga's Alex, a woman who describes herself to him with "just think of me as you with a vagina"one of many great lines.

There is a lot of subtlety and intricate weaving of plot lines throughout the story, details and sequences that need to be seen fresh to get the full benefit of the film. What you might initially think is a witty comedy about a jerk of a guy who not only thinks he's better than everyone else, but actually is, that either finds the error of his ways or gets dropped down a peg or two, eventually becomes a tale chock full of heart and emotion. The real success story of the film is a revelatory performance from Clooney who really knocks this on out of the park. He always showed the charisma and chops to play confident and successful, but here is allowed to also branch out and express the pent-up frustration that comes with isolated loneliness, the passion one can have for a job that seems horrible, yet, when treated carefully, is a job to take seriously, and the compassion for humanity on the whole, softening enough to realize that there are people around him that need help besides his laid off strangers, help that only he can provide. The evolution he undertakes is really pretty amazing and I credit Kirn, Reitman, and Clooney for pulling it off with grace and laughter.

Every single actor is unforgettableeven the bit parts like Zach Galifianakis and especially J.K. Simmons as two corporate employees who's jobs have been eliminated. Jason Bateman is hilarious as Clooney's smug boss, fully embodying the take no crap nonchalance he made famous in "Arrested Development"; Farmiga is gorgeous and competent to be able to go toe-to-toe with Clooney in the detachment and power-hungry attitude of flying in style for half a year or more; and, if George's reinvention of character is revelatory, then Kendrick's naïve Natalie is masterful. This girl was top in her class, able to get a job in her field wherever her heart desired, yet settled for this firm specializing in firing people so as to not dirty the workers' real superior's hands. Young and confused about life in the big world of adulthoodset on a plan for marriage and children to occur as though set times on a clockher eyes are opened to the intimacy and fragility with which a person's mental state can be affected by mere words. When you put them all together, Up in the Air resonates on so many levels; deserving of any praise and accolades to be bestowed upon it. Hilariously funny every second of the way, it is still unafraid to dig into the dark moments of life and treat them with respect and relevancy, going places you wouldn't think it would have the guts to go. You really can't say too much about the film, a top ten of the year entry for sure. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age.

So 2009, and the decade known as...(what do we call this decade?), are ending later this month. And there is no better film to wrap up a (frankly) terrible decade (in terms of news events, unemployment, the economy, the media stronghold, the trashing and dumbing down of American culture, technology, narcissism, vanity obsession, a divided nation, violence and hostility) than Up in the Air. The film, the best I've seen all year and one of the best of the decade, captures many of the factors that made this decade the worst one, at least in my 42 years. The 70s may have been bad economically but hey, at least we had Bruce Springsteen and real music on the radio, women still seemed to like men and not only if the men were millionaires, thoughtful movies in the theater, and only five or so TV channels to pick from. Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man with no "roots," (that is, no wife, no kids, and his apartment in Omaha is about as furnished as a room at Embassy Suites), who fires people for a living because the companies who hire him are too cowardly to do it themselves. It is a juicy role for Clooney, who has made a career out of playing easy-talking charmers. The film sounds depressing and in many ways it is, but it is also witty, quietly hilarious at times, and full of pathos when it becomes a morality piece near the middle (and like the best morality pieces, it doesn't shove its message down your throat). It reminded me in many ways of American Beauty, the masterpiece that capped off the '90s when it hit theaters ten years ago. Clooney's character slowly is stripped of the things he only cared about--including a one-night-stand that becomes a "Same Time Next Year"-like meeting in Hampton Inns and Hiltons in Miami, Detroit, Wichita and other random cities, with another constant traveler (we never know what exactly she does, and that's not supposed to matter) played by Vera Farmiga, who may win an Oscar nomination for her mysterious, slightly passive and jaded, 30something character. The final important character is an eager young Cornell graduate (played by Anna Kendrick, from Twilight) who thinks that a career in firing people is a wise choice now, and in some respects she's not that far off. Her character represents many of the Twitter-obsessed twentysomethings driven for money money money, who live for texting, and has naive and even immature ideals of what makes a relationship work. But she too goes through a transformation, as Up in the Air reaches a "feel good while feeling bad" quality of Frank Capra's darker films, like Meet John Doe. One of the most amazing things about this film is its use of real people in the "firing scenes;" people who have really lost their jobs several weeks or months before being filmed. Director Jason Reitman combines scenes of these people being fired by Clooney and Kendrick, and their instant responses are wholly authentic. There are a few actors playing the "firees" as well, but they blend in with the real folks. I really can't think of a better film to cap off this decade. This one will stay with you. Highly recommended.

Director Jason Reitman, that has brought us great Indie classics such as Thank You for Smoking and Juno has crafted his most personal and most effective portrait to date, Up in the Air. The film stars George Clooney, also giving his most intimate and beautiful performance of his career, as Ryan, a traveling "Firing-Man," who plans on racking up as much frequent flyer miles as he can. Completely void of human connection and emotion, even from his two sisters, one of which is getting married, Ryan seems completely content with his choice of living. All seems well until he meets his female version in the beautiful and charismatic Alex, played with sexual force and intensity by Vera Farmiga. At the same time, a change at his job makes him acquire a student, Natalie, played with sensitivity and vigor by Anna Kendrick, to learn the ropes of the business before potentially making a devastating change to Ryan's way of life.

The film, based on the book of the same title, is a moving and witty piece of cinema. The line deliveries given are some of the best liners of the year. The adaptation by Reitman and Sheldon Turner is of beautiful and social importance in today's day and age. There was no better time than now, to bring a film like this to the table. Dana E. Glauberman's crisp and precise editing sets the pace as we travel with Ryan in this beautiful account. Reitman's direction shows he's a force to be reckoned with and should be in full blown force for Oscar consideration along with the adaptation shared with Turner.

George Clooney, who's having one hell of a year along with his other comedic turn in The Men Who Stare at Goats, gains sympathy and emotion from the viewer, which up until now, Clooney had always struggled for. The role is right up Clooney's alley and with humorous strength, conveys the pain and loneliness of an otherwise charming man successfully.

Vera Farmiga as Alex, is a beautiful as she is dark, and as sexy as she is ugly. Farmiga has finally landed the right role that, in her years of wrong place at the wrong time, should land her a first-time Oscar nomination. Never showing her hand, Farmiga keeps and earns your trust, attention, and admiration. It's one of the most divisive and structurally brilliant supporting turns of the year. 

Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices. Kendrick earns your care and concern for the character, as she follows Ryan around and constantly badgers him about happiness and love, she naïvely and courageously shows the tenderest parts of youth in today's world. Kendrick will likely be sitting along side Farmiga at Oscar's ceremony.

Jason Bateman, playing Craig Gregory, the boss in charge, is amusing in a brief but memorable role. Amy Morton and Melanie Lynsky, who play Ryan's sisters, are valuable and sufficient enough to book end a wonderful tale. Danny McBride, an outstanding comic talent to watch, is as good as ever. And finally, in otherwise cameos, Sam Elliott and the great Zack Galifianakis are uproarious in their respective roles.

This could very well be the crowd and critical pleaser of the year. It has what the 2004 film Sideways lacked, the emotional edge. Long after the film, you take these characters home with you and remind yourself of its authenticity in delivery, poise, and premise. Up in the Air is one of the best pictures of the year. ****/****

Anyone who has ever been fired must see "Up In The Air." Jason Reitman has done again. The director of "Thank You For Smoking" and "Juno" puts real life out there in an incredible way, where we all laugh and then walk out of the theatre thinking about what is really important. A film with a message that's entertaining: what a concept.

George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that flies all over the country firing people for companies that don't have the spine to do it themselves. He is so proficient at it, when he meets his "expert traveler" equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); he is emotionally drawn to another person, beyond a passing interest, for the first time.

Bingham's travels are a quest to be a traveling legend. When his company takes the advice of young newbie, Natalie Keener (Kendrick), he is grounded, endangering his quest to achieve frequent flier miles that number in the, uh, stratosphere. When his boss (Jason Bateman) assigns him to "show her the ropes," so she can revolutionize the company's firing technology, the resulting road trip is not only riotously funny, it is a self-exploring journey into the three people's strengths and weaknesses. The life decisions they make are the emotionally important message of the film.

The rest of the story must go untold, so you can savor every morsel from your own perspective. For that is what this film does best. Almost all of us have been canned. Sitting across the table, being told we'll be glad it happened, one day. Our participation in the film is subtle, as we sit across the table from Bingham as he cans us.

The film's cast is like the story: they suck you in. Clooney is Clooney, like Cary Grant was Cary Grant. You think he's not acting, that's just who he is in real life. Maybe it is. Vera Farmiga's performance is seductively natural. You've met people like her. You admire her. Then you find out you don't know her at all. She is the mystery you wish you were. Anna Kendrick as Natalie is a perfect, perky, know-it-all that becomes all too human. Kendrick makes her character's transformation special parts of the film, when she could have easily have been regulated to a supporting character. This has become Reitman's trademark as a director. He empowers actors to make the movie their own.

Up In The Air is a movie that is over before you want it to be. You want to get to know the characters better, to follow them around a little longer and make sure everything goes well for them. Another credit to Reitman for his extraordinary skill at taking the common things in life and make them extraordinary. Which makes us all feel better about the common-ness of our own lives.

"Up In the Air" is perhaps the most hyped film of the year, and also the most undeserving of said hype.

The story is a simple and predictable one. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a consultant sent throughout the country to fire unsuspecting employees for bosses too cowardly to do the job themselves. He lives for the routine of these trips and the frequent flier miles, spending only a few days at home in a studio apartment too small for a house cat. Enter 23 year-old upstart Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who revolutionizes the process with video conferencing, removing the last human element from the job. Bingham is naturally horrified by the changes and is forced to take Natalie under his wing, teaching her the ways of the force, getting her to loosen up while simultaneously showing her a thing or two about humanity and the wisdom of experience. As his relationship with fellow chronic traveler Alex (Vera Farmiga) heats up, Natalie imparts her own advice to Bingham, helping him to grow a heart.

I could have let the predictable story go if director Jason Reitman had given the audience something else, anything else. But the script is entirely lackluster, full of cheap one liners that even Clooney's usual charm just barely supports. Clooney does his usual Cary Grant routine, which is neither here nor there, not horrible, but not groundbreaking, all sadness in the eyes and slight smile. It is refreshing to see Vera Farmiga as a love interest, a woman over 30 who neither whores herself out or plays the strong ice queen, but exudes intelligence and confidence without becoming a caricature of the high-powered woman. Here, she's entirely natural and beautiful in an atypical way. I'm also strangely attached to Kendrick, who doesn't do anything that impressive, but seems to be trying hard enough. It's in the few bonding moments between Clooney's Bingham and Kendrick's Natalie that the film takes a minute of serious drama and finds a bit of sincerity, but these moments are few and far between.

If the film had concentrated on the superficiality and desolation of corporate consulting, we might have gotten somewhere. Or, if Bingham and Natalie had found themselves unemployed, the film might have presented just the type of irony and schadenfreude we would need to relate. Instead, the film makes an attempt to reach out to the jobless masses of America in the most trite and insulting way possible, the only slight reflection of sincerity found in the sadness of Clooney and Kendrick's eyes as they listen to the newly unemployed lament their inevitable fates.

Many critics have praised this film for its timeliness and Reitman's understanding of the current American situation. It was irritating to sit there and watch Bingham tell a man that being fired was his chance to become a French cuisine chef, after the man had just talked about his expensive mortgage and his daughter's need of health care. After a little smile and pep talk from Bingham, the man is suddenly on board, ready to follow his dreams. It's always helpful to be positive and stay focused, but there comes a point when this sort of clichéd platitude becomes insensitive, and here, Reitman shows himself the king of producing them. The film didn't need this sort of faux validation to draw out the drama, there was already enough there to work with.

For a typical film, Up In the Air is perfectly satisfactory and an enjoyable enough distraction for anyone that gets pleasure watching Clooney do what he does best. But ignore the hype, ignore the awards, and lower your expectations. There's nothings shocking or particularly moving here, unless of course you're one of the unemployed. In that case, it's better to just go see something like "Avatar" and escape for a few hours.

We are drawn in by interesting, unique storyline and smart satirizations. About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.

What the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) don't stay put. 

A Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms. 

The two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, non-committal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have. 

There were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society. 

It is not so much Clooney's acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy.

On the surface, an easy going film with an almost message, semi-memorable characters and a bit of believability. George Clooney's 'Ryan' goes around the country firing people for corporations that don't have the respect or humanity to do it themselves.

There is a love interest here and there is the moderately keen, Miss Keener ready to revolutionize the world of firing tagging along with charming Ryan. But where the film could have said something about human relationships, about humanity, about the real Zeitgeist of our incredibly cut throat Western world with its reliance on child labour designer clothing, Made in China products and our pathetic reliance on technology to improve our lives, it jumps into a banal story about the human heart and learning to let go of control. Once again, another film about a man afraid of the Commitment Monster...

Blah... trite and too basic to be tender, the director had a potential gold mine here but mined the blasé and the overused. A film with such an intriguing idea skips around the Truth and the Heart, giving us a leading man burnt by a woman and living on in a world far too much like his broken heart. Just blah.

And again... what a great idea for a film (based on the book) but everything you'd want to see in it, they leave out...(how lives are destroyed by the inhuman terminations...) go figure... No one is changed in this movie, no one is really touched and Miss Keener gets a great job at the end (leading me to believe she might get fired later by someone like Ryan had this been a good movie).

This film is about a man who fires people for a living. His world becomes upside down when his job is radically changed by a newly recruited young fresh graduate.

"Up in the Air" is a well made film. The plot focuses on character development and emotional changes of the characters. It is not easy to make characters interesting and memorable, but "Up in the Air" does just that. Both the characters of George Clooney and Anna Kendrick have strongly divergent attitudes and personalities, but they have great chemistry and change each other slowly but surely. How they radically shake each others core belief is engagingly told. I enjoyed watching "Up in the Air" a lot, as it tells an engaging story of self discovery.

Dealing just with thematics and ignoring the fact that, throughout, I found watching the film to be trying (enough in itself, of course, to warrant a poor rating), Up in the Air doesn't work: it's disingenuous and self-contradictory.

Clooney's character is positioned at the outset as sharp and appealing, his ideas apt with respect to the world in which we see him engaged. Yet, contradicting itself tonally and explicitly in terms of its two dueling ideologies (alienation versus connection), pulling the proverbial rug from under its protagonist's feet, Clooney  falsely  endorses his sister's marriage and "transforms" into a man who longs for what he previously had with such conviction shunned. Ultimately, it comes down, not to content, but to the way Reitman deals with the material. Many great films laud human connection as invaluable, but Up in the Air doesn't make me buy its central character's arc or its confused conclusion.

Ryan Bingham (Clooney) speaks with his sister's fiancé, Jim, played by Danny McBride, and effectively convinces him to go through with the marriage with Julie despite Jim's legitimate (and convincing) doubts. The scene is not, as Reitman intended, indicative of some kind of maturation in Bingham  it's a self-contradiction. The scene following this betrays the film's bias and cues us emotionally; the sweet contempo-folk track and the loving kiss and make-up between husband-and-wife-to-be work to posit the marriage as authentic in the eyes of the film-text: it's a necessary affirmation of true love. Reitman plays this scene as warm and sweet; truly, its an acquiescence to the cultural status-quo that clashes with what the film has presented so far about marriage and relationships, as well as with Bingham's character as we've come to understand him. Marriage is "adult" and real, says the film, as opposed to Clooney's philosophy, which it dismisses ad hominem as "childish" rather than dealing with in any substantive way. Bingham ought to "grow up," says his young co-worker Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Case closed.

So, we're presented with conflicting images: that of Bingham's (and the film's) endorsement of his sister's marriage; and that of relationships in general as transient and contrary to one's own interests (Alex, Bingham's sister, Natalie: all in varyingly failed or unhappy relationships). But nothing is done to either reconcile the tension between these or make any sense of them. They simply exist in the film alongside each other, despite their mutual exclusivity. Additionally, we can't understand why Bingham shifts camps. His sudden move from self-aware, post-modern isolationist to pining romantic is jarring and forced rather than organic. This might have been fixed were there some genuine chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. A fifty year old man doesn't easily change in a major way how he lives his life, especially when he's as entrenched in his lifestyle/work as Bingham is. Clooney's interest in Alex (Farmiga) isn't enough to be convincing. How can he be willing to change everything on the basic of a few hot nights and some cute texts? (Armond White touches on another crucial flaw with the film in discussing this: "...this movie looks wretched. The lack of emotional rapport between the actors starts with each one's poor lighting and bad angles.") The film simply makes an arbitrary value judgment without sufficient textual support: marriage and relationships are, innately, more meaningful and important than one's career. Apparently, for Reitman, this is a self-evident fact, needing no convincing elucidation.

The film presents Bingham as having, in the most facile sense of the word, "matured" by the film's end. He's rejected his "empty backpack" philosophy, but, sadly, can't have the woman he wants. The monologues by terminated employees at the end has one saying something to the effect of: "In the end, it's my family  my wife and kids  that are what matter to me most." Rather than being complicated, Up in the Air is simply confused. The first two acts of the film are spent showing (1) how problematic relationships and marriage are and (2) how lucid and believable Bingham's philosophy actually is. In way the film presents his sister's marriage (and with lines like the above), Up in the Air is shown to endorse an institution that it simultaneously shows to be non-functional. Clooney's final words indicate that he's alone for the long haul, forever "doomed" to the air. But, if anonymous-terminated-employee as well as Bingham's own sister and Danny McBride can have a meaningful, "good" marriage/relationship, why can't Bingham? It doesn't add up. Interestingly, the film begins with him being far more satisfied that he is at the conclusion. Yet, perplexingly, the new ideology (that leaves him less happy) is the one the film endorses, and the lifestyle of alienation (the one that, if not leaving him happy, at least led to his being in some way satisfied  perhaps the best anyone can be said to do) is dismissed offhand as childish. 

A better film might have thoughtfully dealt with the tension between a desire for connection and the impossibility of genuine, lasting connection in post-modern, commodified society (a society in which Clooney has very effectively ingratiated himself and of which he has become, through his work, a somewhat fearful, but very real, emblem). Instead, Up in the Air is simply symptomatic of said desire. Because Up in the Air is so bafflingly blind to the relationship-problematics it outlines within its very plot content, it thus fails even to be ideologically reassuring, because, by endorsing what it at the same time show to be false  and disingenuously forcing its protagonist to do so as well  the viewer emerges from the theater confused rather than assuaged. There are films that convincingly and entertainingly deal with the importance of family and romantic love (from just this year, both Away We Go and Funny People), but Up in the Air is not one of them.

Up In the Air takes us to the story about Ryan Bingham, respective man who flitting from city to city to sack employees, yes it's his job. I've never heard about such job so to my utterly astonishment I knew that some bosses are to gutless to do this themselves, so they hire such guys as Ryan Binghanm to do it. Ryan Bingham is a perfect guy, charming, seductive, smart, well-groomed and real gentleman. He's into juice when it's necessary, likes to talk in sarcastic and trenchant tone, has cynic attitude to almost every things in that life especially love and family. No doubt a lot of men dreaming about such life as he has.

Jason Reitman (the director of Up In the Air) tries to show that it's not right to be such kind of person. Because family and love are obviously the most important things (in his opinion of course). That's the main thing that disappointed me in Up In the Air. I had always assumed that no one knows what's the most relevant thing for every people in this world. If somebody wants to make family, OK no problem! Go on! If you want to be single, OK, go on! And nobody can blame anyone in wrong life attitude, cos it's impossible to prove which attitude is the most correct. Everybody choose his own way and it's his choice. Besides real life already proved that in most cases truly happy family it's a utopia and there is nothing to do with it. 

So why Jason Reitman persistently tries to prove that's the only one way is right? Why? Why he shows us that we shouldn't neglect family and love? I don't understand it. If he thinks that everybody who hasn't got family is miserable I'd say he's seriously mistakes. He can't decide for over the 6 billiards of people. Everyone have his own view on happiness. And badly that such idea in dozens of movies brainwash the public and make them to do what they don't want in fact. I'm happy that at least George Clooney's hero eventually remained single and proceeded his travel around US. Surely such move deserves accolade because it's quite uncommon element of Hollywood movies when love story line ends tragically. No expected happy-end, that's the only one reason I loved the film. 

Clooney's elegant veneer great as always but it hasn't satiric reflection, his jokes, are quite amusing and make you chuckle occasionally, but nothing special. Comedy is not the strongest side of this work. Anyway it's a good movie to ponder about life in a deep sense of it, but at my point spectator shouldn't instantly take a side of the director here, spectator just need to realize that our life has different ways and nobody can blame if you choose another one instead of typical family path.

We watched Up in the Air yesterday, by director Jason Reitman (of Thank You for Smoking and Juno fame) with George Clooney and two great female actresses- Vera Farmiga playing George's love interest and Anna Kendrick as his overly zealous co-worker. It was nice to get to know these two new faces. I had not seen Vera in a film before although she looked familiar and you might recognize Anna from the Twilight Saga where she plays Jessica, Bella's friend.

The movie is a very fast paced, excellently written, quite dark comedy centering around Clooney's character and his job which is firing people whose bosses "don't have the balls to sack their own employees". The actors playing the "firees" are real life people who have been terminated, adding a certain poignancy to their candid interviews. There are some excellent one-liners that come of these which George delivers perfectly "try not to take this personally", "review this packet, I am sure you will find a lot of helpful information in it" etc. These scenes make for some extremely memorable moments and George excels in the cynical but casual portrayal of his character, delivering each line with a super size heaping of charm.

Vera is fantastic as his female counterpart and quasi clone of him. I was most impressed with Anna and thought she did a terrific job maintaining her seriousness and composure during many of the firing scenes and hilarious interactions with George. One favorite of mine was when he forces her to change suitcases at the airport and to carry on instead of checking in- something he learned saves him about a week of time each year. While his luggage is always extremely neatly packed, each type of clothing having its own compartment, hers is overflowing with loose items and even a pillow. George proceeds to throw out half of her belongings as he tries to initiate her to his road warrior ways. He imparts some more wisdom when he tells her to always stand in line behind Asians, as they are quick and efficient. A pleasant relationship grows between them and it is nice to watch his character melt just a little bit.

Some of the banter between him and Vera is very funny but at times feels over scripted and not quite real, such as when they are comparing their elite status cards at their first meeting. I thought this was a bit overdone but very enjoyable nonetheless.

There is a lot of American Airlines and Hilton promotion but in counterpart Reitman got to shoot a lot of airport, airplane and hotel scenery for free and that's a pretty smart decision so once you know that, the blatant placement doesn't get too much in the way.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable film, speaking very much to today's mood and spirit, easy to watch, with many laugh out loud moments. What could me more fun and humorous than to watch a company thriving on the misfortune of others. Things don't end so well for George's character Ryan Bingham however, as the holes and lack of performance in his own life are exposed throughout his journeys- no significant other, no children, weak ties with his family and worst of all, no place to call home.

Fabio and I both definitely recommend this film and give it a whopping 9/10! Please visit http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com and become a follower to read more reviews!

Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) works for a company based in Omaha in downsizing business and gives motivational lectures. He travels to other companies to fire people and to give advice to the employee in their next step in their careers. The pragmatic and independent Ryan is completely detached and cool and he does not have any steady relationship and does not believe in marriage. He only dreams on reaching ten million miles in his favorite air company. During a trip, he meets the cynical executive Alex (Vera Farmiga) and they have one night stand; further they schedule a next encounter in Miami a couple of weeks later. When he returns to his head office, his boss has just hired the rookie and arrogant Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) that suggests the use of video-conference to fire people from their jobs and reduce the costs of flights, hotels and meals. Ryan exposes the failures in the proposed system and his boss assigns him to travel with Natalie to learn the procedure. Along their journey crossing America, Ryan has a closer contact with Alex and his family and feels uncertainty in his credo. In the end, he realizes that he is only a parenthesis in the life of Alex.

"Up in the Air" is one of the most intelligent romantic comedy I have ever seen. The delightful story is engaging, with witty dialogs, dramatic situations and a charming couple  I am a big fan of the lovely Vera Farmiga, and George Clooney has his best performance in years, showing a wonderful chemistry with Ms. Farmiga. Anna Kendrick is hilarious in the role of Natalie and her attitudes reflect the behavior part of the younger generation. The double meaning of the original title is not possible to translate to Portuguese. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): "Amor Sem Escalas" ("Love without Stop Over")

This is one of the grimmer, unpleasant, and dehumanizing films I've seen in some time. Basically, its also an extended product-placement ad for American Airlines and Hilton Hotels, whose corporate logos are smacked in your face about every 10 minutes. Also its vaguely like the film "Koyaanisqatsi" but with actors and a story-line. I think that if the friends that I saw it with had put our heads together half-way through and done a whispered conference, we would have happily agreed to cut our losses and walk out. We wouldn't have missed much, including one of the more predictable plot "twists" in recent years.

I've been speculating on how on earth it could possibly win awards, let alone get much attention or praise. I'm guessing that - - Industry-insiders (and some reviewers) know Clooney personally and like him a lot (and they probably also know and like others involved in this production) - Like the main character, industry-insiders also spend a tremendous amount of their lives jetting around dealing with airports, accumulating air-miles which they have no time to use up, and staying in airport hotels. They probably closely identify with that part of his life.

- Adults are so incredibly desperate for movies aimed at a mature adult audience that they're grabbing anything that comes along (for example "It's Complicated") and celebrating it just because it exists.

I'd say that the fact that this film was generating major Oscar-buzz is a telling indicator of just how twisted and desperate an age we're living in. Its like the world of "Idiocracy" keeps inching a few years closer...

I really liked the movie, it kind of invites you to bring your own wine. There's a lot of probing into modern life and relationships, and it's up to you what you take from the film and what you feel for each of the characters. I was quite grateful for having seen Reitman's Thank You For Smoking (2005) previously, because both movies are really arch in the way they set up people in thoroughly pariah job roles and then get you to warm to them. So it didn't really come as a shock to see Clooney as an HR consultant (Ryan Bingham) whose job is to fire people in redundancy exercises where the management are too yeller, instead it rated an amused and knowing eyebrow raise.

Although a lot of the movie concerns the workplace, the disconnect between the interests of corporates and the interests of society (a link that was present historically in America, but which has been irrevocably decoupled), and how to work in that environment, the interest for me was more to do with relationships. From my male perspective there are some fairly poisonous insights into the female mind (though it may be unfair to generalise), the young Cornell grad Natalie Keener (played by Anna Kendrick) talks about her preconceptions of the man she will meet, the kind of name he will have, apparently the only thing he will love more than her is their "golden lab". The slightly older perspective from Alex Goran (played by Vera Farmiga) is that the man should be taller, should earn more, and come from a good family. To go with the aeronautical theme of the movie, the theatre should have provided some sick bags.

The main theme is, for me, pure Frank Borzage, it's about earning the right to love and be loved. In common with 80 years ago when those movies were being made, it's an onus that only weighs upon the male of the species, which makes the film a little hackneyed.

My favourite ambiguity of the film would have to be the backpack lectures that Bingham (Clooney) gives. He has a whole metaphor about everything in your life, the people, the trinkets, all the stuff you can collect, being in a backpack and weighing you down. He says that people aren't swans, they're not meant to be together forever, that they're actually sharks, who have to keep swimming continually, weighed down by nothing. I think there's an element of truth to both poles, I can see both arguments. I just love going to a Hollywood movie and not having an opinion shoved down my throat.

I had a slight problem regarding the level of realism in the film, I felt that the air-commuter lifestyle that was being shown was over-slicked, like I was watching something of a feather with The Consequences Of Love (or Giulia Doesn't Sleep At Night, two of the great modern hyper-stylised films from Italy). Nothing wrong with stylisation, except that I think Jason was trying to go for a film that had a lot of resonance with Recession America. I felt it was awkward to introduce real-life folks at the end, and also realistic looking termination assessments (or whatever they're called when you can someone), when the actors such as Clooney and Vera Farmiga were just so damned suave, as if from a different universe.

And this is to Claire.

What this has going for it: a solid performance by the girl who plays Natalie, a few droll lines, and a twist. But this twist is actually the worst thing about this film. It's worse than the 'Requiem for a Dream' quick-cut repetitive sequences. It's worse than Clooney's relentless crinkly-eyed smile, which I could not take any more, ever, after twenty minutes. It's worse than the cliché parades of fired people and their contrasting reactions, and it's worse than the blatant, blatant, blatant metaphors of travel/solitude/loneliness/baggage. What is it? The twist is when Clooney's character runs from his isolationist preaching gig to find his lady love, only to knock at her door and discover her married and with kids. And this 'twist' took me by surprise simply because the screenplay had made it unthinkable. Had Clooney remained devoted to flying around and the woman an occasional liaison, fine. But LONG BEFORE his dream is shattered by her, he reveals himself changing. He takes her to his old school. He takes her to his sister's wedding. He opens up very, very much. So - her speech to him afterward about his being just a 'good time guy', as well as her anger and confusion, are utterly ridiculous. This made me really angry, that poor writing gets to jump chasms over continuity. All in all, this is Hollywood-as-meaningful tripe. You're better off with the Vampire garbage.

Attention, all people who are happy being alone! You're not really happy! Believe me! You need to run out right now and find that perfect soul mate to spend your life with. Yes, you may find out that they are already married to someone else and that you are just their favorite chew toy, but believe me, it's you that has not grown up, not them. You should have your own family that is happy to stay at home while you travel 9 months out of the year, so that you can cheat on them. THIS WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY. And it will never lead to any painful consequences or lost years, when it doesn't work out. Also remember that if you ever lose your job, it's best to do so when you have people depending on you because they will make it so much easier on you, and will be right by your side at the unemployment line supporting you all the way. Don't pay any attention to the stats that show divorce is next on the todo list after job loss, complete with the angry ex spouse and the dysfunctional kids.

Such is the inane message fed to the hungry mouths suckling at the teat of this film, but for me this heavy handed and simplistic message overwhelmed the film, and made what started out to be a decent light comedy, into a self contradictory philosophical mess suited only to a ten year old.

**Major Spoilers** For about two thirds of Up In The Air, I was thinking to myself, "this is definitely going to be on my top five list for the year." The acting is very good. The characters were strong and likable. The dialogue was sharp and witty. There seemed to be the right mixture of both comedy and drama. It felt like a movie that was going somewhere great. Then came the rest of the story. Don't get me wrong. I've seen some films before that were ruined by bad endings. Up In The Air does not fall into that category. In fact, I wouldn't even call the ending bad. It was just not as well done as the rest of the movie. It felt hurried and predictable. I honestly don't think any of the events that occurred at the end of the film were a surprise to anyone watching (including the "major" revelation about Vera Farmiga's character). And a few of the scenes felt like they were slipped in out of obligation (i.e. the scene where Clooney's character calls the airline to set up a trip for his sister and her husband, or when we find out that Anna Kendrick's character quit because of the suicide). However, even with all of that, I still liked it. There was still so much that was good about this movie, that it might not be on my top five list for the year, but it is definitely on my top ten.

Nice message about what's really important in life. Nice delivery without being too obvious or overstated. Realistic characters, rather than caricatures. Good...well, everything.

So why wasn't I blown away? Maybe it's because my parents were passionately politically active and socially responsible. Maybe it's because I grew up with people who put their whole heart on the line every day for the things that mattered most in life. Maybe it's because I would never date or marry a person as disconnected as George Clooney's character. I'm not even sure how to BE as disconnected as George Clooney's character.

I get the genius of it. A guy lives his whole life never looking too deeply inside, and eventually, he decides to take a risk. A huge risk for someone like him. And it doesn't pan out. Does he fall apart? No. He shrugs his shoulders and goes back to his old ways, for the most part, but with a certain resigned melancholy brought on by his new self-awareness. That's life for most people. It just isn't my life.

Humanity makes me sad sometimes.

It's time to send Hollywood a message that we will not blindly rave about commercials in movies. This movie had not one, but three or four commercials for a car rental company written in. The Oscars should not be taking movies like this seriously. I could not pay attention to the film when the commercials went on and on. Seeing a can of soda unmentioned on a counter or Reeses pieces on the ground is one thing, but this film went too far and movie goers seem to be stupid about it. Keep going, and we'll just have more and more of this junk. The acting was OK, particularly Anna Kendrick as the role of the new kid on the block trying to change the way the game is played then having a change of heart when she learns from the seasoned master of dismissal, but if you take out the commercials, how long would this film really be? Clooney was typical Clooney in my opinion, hard to watch him without remembering who he is throughout the entire piece. Meryl Streep can bring you into a character so much that you forget it's Meryl on the screen, Clooney may be totally charming, but he seldom has me forgetting it's him rather than allowing me to get lost in the character so I can enjoy the film more.

I wish I had seen this back to back with "The Informant!"

Both are good examples of what I think is a new phenomenon in film narrative. No, not exactly new; rather the techniques are maturing to the point that people don't notice them any more. And that's what you want.

It is a matter of ambiguous narration. We've always had this, even with silent movie cards. For 75 years or so (let's start with Kane), we've had the sliding notion of the narration of the storyteller, the "voiceover" narration of the protagonist, and the interior narration of one character to another. This latter is obvious in many bad science fiction movies where the professor patiently explains some key dynamics of the story. We accept that these can meld  have for decades.

But we now have a trend where we like to have narrative perspectives made discrete and explicit because we like to play games with what one knows that another does not, and how one can annotate another. So we have movies like "Informant," whose key hook is in weaving ambiguities among these platforms.

Here in "Up" is a more complex and delicate composition. First of all, instead of being built on the great confrontation between the big and little guy, it moves on the conflict between independent loneliness and risk in losing ones' self in another.

It is about love, is modern in the sense that it moves the tension into the narrative structure itself, and is tuned well, because Clooney knows what he is doing. 

We have the on screen narrator, Clooney's character Bingham, who knows more than the character does. He narrates to a novice. He also narrates as a living, triggering change in other characters. We hear those characters as bona fide narrators. We hear Bingham to them, to himself, to his apprentice, and to a romantic possibility he finds. Its all about story, each one, and about the dissonances and overlaps among them.

The power comes from some large things and small. 

The large device is obvious. The standard fold in films is to have an inner "film" of some kind that allows us to enter as participant. Here it is a remote video conferencing for one of the narrative threads, allowing us to fold in to that one only. 

The "small" narrative device factors powerfully in the film, but the mechanism is somewhat hidden. The template we are expecting is the standard romantic pattern: love is found, lost and regained. This is broken: our guy does not get anything close to wholeness. He goes back to a hell of what both he and we know will be loneliness. The apprentice girl learning about love? Her life is ruined by a suicide that will haunt her, caused by inept handling of false narrative. The effectiveness of the folding device of video conferencing? Discarded as ineffective.

It all turns on our discovery that Bingham is himself a narrative, a distraction, a fabrication in the romantic sense. It comes from out of the blue because there are so many narrators, so many fabricators that we didn't notice the power of this one, Bingham's love interest played by Vera Farmiga. Her power is absolute and breaks everything. This could be a depressing movie if you are sensitive to job loss, suicide and disappointment in love. But it is designed to pass the narrative prerogative to you to handle, so is judged as "intelligent."

The inner plot is its own narrative. Two young lovers are getting married. One is related by birth, the other by being a salesman of the artificial. Bingham gives them the happiness he cannot have, that he has to deny himself. (There are hints that problems with his parents is the cause.) He literally at the end gives them his happiness in terms of the credits he has accumulated in his endeavors. This in substitute for their own fabricated happiness (in the form of a fake honeymoon).

01-08-10 "Up in the Air" is a thoughtful and satisfying entertainment. I'm a big fan of the team of creative artists who made it happen. It's an amazing work of art from auteur, Jason Reitman. All the more impressive is the fact that he's only thirty-two. All of these kudos notwithstanding, I want to briefly address the character of Alex because therein lies a serious flaw. I'm not confirmed in my opinion, however, so I want to put it out here for possible contradiction.

Early in the second act, Alex (Vera Farmiga) starts showing palpable signs of falling in love with Ryan (George Clooney): her eyes, facial expressions and energy feel to me like a woman not only falling in love, but also a woman actively (although not verbally) seeking a deeper emotional bond and commitment. This culminates in the conversation with Natalie (Anna Kendrick), when Alex talks about the importance of marriage, children and home.

After Ryan and Alex attend his sister Julie's (Melanie Lynskey) wedding, Ryan is seeing clearly the emptiness of his jet-setting life and then, suddenly, he stops mid-sentence during one of his lectures and rushes to Chicago to see Alex; I think there's a marriage proposal balancing on the tip of his tongue.

Was Ryan primed for this change of attitude by recent events? Yes. Were the looks, expressions, energies and statements of Alex an important part of this priming? Yes.

When the big reveal happens, and Alex is uncovered as a committed wife and mother who only wants side-action with Ryan, I thought to myself, as the writer and director, Jason Reitman has exaggerated and simplified the transparency of Alex's feelings for Ryan in order to insure that the big reveal plays as a reversal that packs a wallop. This wallop, I think, comes at the expense of the psychological realism and moral validity of Alex.

Please consider an alternate second act in which the character of Alex is a bit more complicated: If Alex is morally and emotionally sound, and I think the movie wants us to feel that, for the most part, she is, then I don't think she would actively solicit a deepening emotional commitment with Alex without informing him that she's unavailable for marriage. A failure to do so is the self-centered, unscrupulous behavior of a rat. Likewise, denying this moral responsibility with a reference to Ryan's commitment to bachelorhood is a flimsy rationalization. It's entirely possible that Alex finds the force of her emotions such that she cannot help moving towards a deepening of emotional feeling for Ryan. However, as a decent person, I think she would have a deep internal conflict with this emotional trend. Of course this internal conflict and holding back by Alex would be detected by Ryan. Quite possibly, Alex would reach the apex of her internal conflict during the wedding, when she sees Ryan turning away from his confirmed bachelorhood towards a union with her. In turn, Ryan might interpret this behavior as a conflict about Alex's desire to maintain her single lifestyle. From here, the movie might show how Ryan, after the influence of his sister's wedding, flip-flops and becomes the person pursuing marriage while the woman resists. The through-line of cavalier good will and humor would be easily maintained by Ryan because he thinks he knows why Alex is resisting and then - Blam! - Ryan goes to Chicago on impulse and discovers the truth.

With this version, the reveal still packs a wallop, Alex remains a somewhat decent person, the psychology of her behavior remains valid and there's no telltale intrusion by the writer-director.

In times of recession, a movie about a guy who fires people for a living is not exactly anyone's idea of entertainment! But, the devilishly charming Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney just does that, making things oddly comical. Enjoying around 300 days on-board, at lounges and hotels, he laments the 40 days at home between trips. 

When he isn't firing, Ryan peddles his 'Baggage free' ideals at motivational lectures and occasionally has a 'good time' with fellow travel buff, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who hit off on a common ground of loyalty card vanity. As Alex calls terms herself as a feminine version of Ryan, the twosome often plan their sojourn across America.

Things change when greenhorn Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) leads his company to a new policy of firing people via internet. Ryan is grounded and dismayed at the prospect of missing his secret ambition of 10 million frequent flier miles. Adding to his woes, his boss Craig Gregory puts Natalie under Ryan's tutelage to lean the business! 

Natalie and Ryan are opposites; while the former hates airports and loves to get back to 'home and family', Ryan loves his unreal life but wants to fire people 'with a personal touch', allowing the story its exploratory flight-path of mutual self discovery of emotional connections, love, family and propriety. While it is easy to portray such themes in gloom, Up in the Air is light hearted, sprinkled liberally with humor while keeping up its pace.

Though, at first, it comes across as a movie on Ryan and his miles, it's not! His conflict is rather within himself, his fear of intimacy, family and commitment. Clooney actually makes you feel for the middle aged and lonely Ryan who fires people but is really not a grown-up within. To their credit, the filmmakers have worked well to create seemingly unreal characters but still leaving enough to imagination and things to relate to! 

Natalie and Alex have their issues too. While the Anna Kendrick plays a pretty, uptight and ambitious girl whose nervousness is situations is comic relief. Poor Natalie is eventually dumped over an SMS. Vera Farmiga as Alex adds her own shades of grey; she has a stable family but seeks out some fun. Do our characters get what they want? Typical to Hollywood style, some answers are direct while some are subtle. 

To bring out the best from those 'fired', the filmmakers actually cast people who had recently lost jobs! Their brief was to look into the camera and say what it felt like being 'fired'! Portraying multiple locales without actually filming there was intelligent production design. The Airport scenes were crisp and realistic. One of the best scenes is Ryan's slick passage through the security check, portraying a seasoned business traveler.

Coming from the Oscar nominated directed by Jason Rietman of "Juno" fame, Up in the Air, adapted from a novel of the same name by Walter Kim is worth watching!

I went into this movie knowing it had a 90% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, and 8.1 here on IMDb, not to mention award nominations galore. So I was expecting something special.

Unfortunately, as with a lot of films that are highly praised these days, I thought this was quite an average film made up of some witty moments, but generally, too much of this was dull and un involving and not nearly as moving as it could have been.

George Clooney is good in the role of Ryan Bingham, a man very content in his life and jet setting job, a man who doesn't appreciate change. George is on screen for almost every minute of the film, and he does well here but it's hardly a stretch for him. We've seen him do this kind of thing before with slight variations of character in films such as One fine day, Oceans 11, 12 and 13, Intolerable cruelty and Out of sight. The rest of the cast are also good, no real standouts, but a cameo from JK Simmons made me sit up.

The script has some amusing moments, none are laugh out loud, merely amusing, a chuckle here and a chuckle there.

What disappointed me most was the lack of emotion I felt whilst watching this. For a film thats 2 hours long and has only its characters talking to keep us glued, the lack of emotion I felt whilst watching was a huge letdown.

To summarise, it's a witty film, along the lines of Sideways and About Schmidt. It's very talky and not a great deal happens. It's focus is on George Clooney, who's character, by the end, doesn't seem to evolve as much as expected. Nor did I!

The only reason I registered on IMDb is so that I can fume about this movie. My girlfriend and I (together for a reason it appears) both hated Up In The Air, not even so much for its trite content, but for the fact that we LOVED the first half of it, and were so rudely let down by the second half of it.

The premise was so great - here is a guy, living a free life - no needless commitments, compromises, fights, promises, negotiations, relationship baggage, financial obligations, or everyday mundane existence of the 8 to 5. I loved the free backpack existence idea. This is something so many people desire - to "just get away from it all," haven't we all heard or said that at some point in our lives? Here we were expecting to see how it could be done and live vicariously through George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham. The carefree hook-ups in hotel rooms, the travel, the unattached existence, the individuality of it all was intoxicating!

Then came the conflict - Ryan Bingham was to be "grounded," and his existence as he knew it - his carefully structured life in the air - would come to an end. What will be the resolution? What will happen? Interesting all the way up until now.

After this moment the movie just took a dive for me. Really, Bingham is to start having second thoughts now? Really, is the plain married, "tied down to earth" life that millions of Americans live out every day SO appealing to the audiences? What's the great artistic innovation here? And, what's up with Vera's character? How laughable that on one hand, there is this entire sappy thread in the movie that tries to show that it is good to have a family, to have someone that you can wake up next to every day, while Vera's character is cheating on her husband with Bingham? Isn't that the ultimate joke? 

It seems the plot did not leave any room for the "in between" crowd - it was a battle between always up in the air, or fully grounded. There are thousands of people who enjoy both a committed relationship and the high life of business travel. According to the movie, there was no place for those people? Why couldn't Ryan and Alex BE in a relationship, and yet enjoy the life in the air? Why couldn't the story support that premise?

The end result was a sappy rom-com, which had a great premise, and gave hope that we could get away for at least the duration of the movie and dream about the freedom that so many of us desire. Yet, it left me disgusted with how given such an interesting beginning, the plot completely disintegrated into yet another Hollywood sap with contradictory conclusions and scattered, unoriginal ideas about life.

Ugh.
