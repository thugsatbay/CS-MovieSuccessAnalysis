### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Tony Stark might be at his best with his gadgets, but ironically his movies are best when he is without them. 'Iron Man 3' is a perfect demonstration of that  for the first 40 mins, Stark is the same arrogant, cocksure person he was in the self-important 'Iron Man 2'; and then after crashing and burning in his damaged suit in the middle of a wintry expanse, Stark is forced to start over, and that rebirth brings back what made the first 'Iron Man' so infectiously entertaining in the first place.

Indeed, you've been warned  don't expect 'Iron Man 3' to be firing from all cylinders right from the get-go as 'The Avengers' did; rather, the road to that payoff is slow and bumpy. This is a 'post-Avengers' Stark, traumatised by his near-death experience closing the Chitauri wormhole back in New York. At the expense of sleep and his relationship with the ever-lovely Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Stark throws himself into work  which to him means further refining his 'Iron Man' armour. In the meantime, he leaves the heavy lifting to Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle), commissioned by the President to fight terror in the War Machine suit (basically the 'Iron Man' fighting machine but in the patriotic colours of red, white and blue).

Col Rhodes' latest target is a terrorist going by the monicker of 'The Mandarin', who has brought his war to home soil after targeting US installations abroad. Only when his former driver cum good friend, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), is fatally injured does Stark sit up and pay attention, and in an ill-advised and egotistical move, reveal his home address in an outright challenge to The Mandarin. That, as you would already know from the trailer, leaves his oceanside home decimated and Stark in a barely functioning suit in the snow-covered wilds of Tennessee.

Up to this point, a lot of what is meant to pass as wisecracks is exchanged as dialogue among Stark, Potts and Hogan, but the smart- talking isn't particularly amusing or engaging and gets increasingly tiresome after a while. But as we said at the start, it is precisely when Stark is forced to start over that the movie starts getting into the groove. Abandoning the slick and sleek mechanical tricks and gimmicks, the middle act settles into a surprisingly old-school act in a small-town-USA where Stark had meant to visit to investigate a recent incident which he suspects is linked to The Mandarin.

There, some of the sparkiest repartee unfolds between Stark and a young kid he meets, Harley (Ty Simpson), who will not only enable him to overcome his PTSD but also become an unlikely pre-pubescent sidekick. The rapport between Stark and Harley significantly enlivens the film, with the 'connection' (there is a special meaning to the quotation here) between them perhaps the most poignant relationship developed here. Thankfully, the delightfully warm and witty midsection only makes the film better from here onwards.

Surpassing expectations of a straightforward good-versus-bad showdown, veteran action movie screenwriter Shane Black and his first-time feature film writer Drew Pearce engineer a couple of elegant twists, including an ingenious revelation on the true identity of The Mandarin. Not to worry, we're not in spoiler mode here, but suffice to say that it is probably the very reason why Academy Award-winning actor Ben Kingsley was enticed to the role. And with that surprise comes the action that you've been waiting for from this summer blockbuster.

Black, who is making his sophomore feature film, offers up two eye- popping set pieces. The first sees a daring attack on Air Force One in mid-air, leaving 13 people in free-fall and a truly exhilarating sequence where Iron Man gets to play 'barrel of monkeys' with all of them and guide them to safety. The second is the elaborate and game- changing climax  not only for the fact that it is the first and only time in the whole movie that we see the Iron Legion in action, but also because it comes to a startling conclusion that re-establishes the dynamic between Stark and Potts. Both are even more astounding considering Black's last and first movie was a crime caper called 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' that never would have primed you into thinking he was capable of such spectacle.

But one supposes that Robert Downey Jr must have seen that potential in Black to recommend him as the candidate to take over Favreau, the familiarity between actor and director paying off in how the former trusts the latter to take the character in a different direction. While he was vulnerable before, Stark did not have the same attachment as he does here with Potts or the same sense of introspection that is evident in his voice-over. In turn, Downey Jr. gives his best performance as Tony Stark/ Iron Man yet, with a newfound sense of frailty that develops convincingly into humility to match his heroics.

Disagree if you must, but we always loved Stark more when he was less full of himself, and a refreshingly new aspect here is the buddy element that sees Stark pairing first with Harley and then with Col Rhodes. In particular, the finale sees a rousing partnership with the latter  both Downey Jr and Cheadle clearly enjoying trading quips and barbs at each other while saving the day. And given how the 'Iron Man' movies have been at their most rousing when Stark rebuilds himself, the last shot of Stark beginning a new phase in his life bodes well for the future of the franchise, especially if it is to continue its life outside of 'The Avengers'.

Saw IRON MAN 3 last night and it was superb. It was the sequel IRON MAN 2 should have been but wasn't and the perfect extrapolation of life after AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The set pieces are suitably awesome and the acting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down to the tiniest bit part (there's a jewel of a cameo from a guard that upstages even Downey's comic timing). The script gets the balance between the epic and the personal just right and Sir Ben delivers two performance for the price of one and both are genius (can't say more - spoilers!). Mr Downey Jr also manages to show even more of the complexity of Tony Stark. Just when you think there's no more to be fracked out of that particular mine, he goes deeper. The writer set out to deliver a fun story and that's exactly what it is. It draws you in from the first moments and doesn't let go. What more could you possibly want?

The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of "The Avengers" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.

One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.

Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.

It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more.

With comic book movies, there is a repeating cycle. The first one has our attention. The sequel, most of the time (in the case of Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight, X2, etc.), outdoes the original. But then we are eventually faced with the third part. In some cases (The Dark Knight Rises), the third part kicks ass. In most cases (Spider-man 3, X-Men: The Last Stand), they are the weakest. Luckily, this is simply not the case for Iron Man 3.

The film takes place after the events of The Avengers, and Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. He's losing sleep, he's having anxiety attacks, and he is slowly becoming distant from his faithful girlfriend Pepper (wonderfully played by Gwenyth Paltrow again). But it only gets worse when a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley, putting on a chilling accent) starts wreaking havoc across the globe.

Guy Pearce shows up as a scientist named Aldrich Killian (what a villain name), and if you know anything about Guy Pearce, you can assume Aldrich isn't very nice. Rebecca Hall, who is very underrated might I add, shows up as Maya, a scientist girl that Tony met in the 90s. And Don Cheadle reprises his Iron Man 2 role as Jim Rhoades, Tony's best friend. There are a lot of plot details that I will leave out because I want you to see Iron Man 3 with an empty mind, otherwise it can't be enjoyed.

I was feeling a lot of things throughout Iron Man 3. I was really into it in the first half hour. Then, these weird fire people showed up, and I thought, "Oh God, are we watching Thor?" (I actually love Thor, but I found the blend of fantasy at first off). But as the film went on it all made sense and I accepted it. Then, I was also feeling de ja vu, because I felt like Killian and Mandarin were fairly similar to Justin Hammer and Ivan from the previous. But that is one of the wonderful things about Iron Man 3: It's unpredictable.

Iron Man 3 is damn good. The heart and soul of this trilogy is Downey Jr., and here is is at his best doing what he does best. Iron Man is my favorite of The Avengers, and really, could you blame me? Downey's amazing. What helps this time is the fact that this one is directed and co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Black has a gift with blending action with humor, and this is easily the funniest of the trilogy. It is also the best acted.

I had a total blast here. Is it as good as something like The Dark Knight trilogy? Well, if you know my stance on that trilogy, then that answer is obvious. Is it as good as the first two? Yes, and maybe even better. The film has a great energy, a great sense of humor, some terrific surprises and some terrific action sequences that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy.

I find it difficult to give comic book movies a 10/10, mainly because I have such a high standard when it comes to them. Yes, perfect comic book movies exist. Is Iron Man 3 perfect? Not quite, because it doesn't exactly have the themes that the perfect comic book movies acquire. In other words, I wasn't moved by it. But that's okay, because the Iron Man trilogy isn't meant to be taken as seriously as some others, and so they shouldn't. But no comic book movie in a long time has danced this close to perfection in a long time. This could be the end of Iron Man. I hope it isn't, but at least he goes out in style.

Five years ago, Tony Stark hit the big screen in style. Smart, action packed, and brilliantly acted, Iron Man was the best Marvel Comics movie yet. But the follow up two years later was something of a disappointment. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, and it certainly had its moments, but it simply didn't capture the awesomeness of its predecessor. Now the third installment has remedied most of its flaws, delivering summer entertainment that's fully satisfying, if not quite equal to the first film.

Iron Man 3 is not the kind of movie to waste much time on set up. From the get go it's clear that all is not well for Tony. He's got his suits and the woman he loves, his company is on stable footing, but there's a shadow looming over him. Because there's a new enemy striking at America from the shadows. A terrorist mastermind who can attack anywhere, anytime leaving no trace but broken bodies and smoldering wreckage. When challenged, he will stretch Tony to his very limits, taking everything that Iron Man can throw at him. And his name is Mandarin.

This is what every fanboy has been waiting for. As great a villain as Obadiah Stane was, the first movie still left one question in the back of my mind; what about the Mandarin? Where is Iron Man's oldest and deadliest foe? This question became more pressing as Tony battled B-list villains like Whiplash and Justin Hammer during the second film. Well now the arch nemesis is here, along with AIM founder Aldrich Killian and a small army of super powered enforcers. And when we finally meet him, he's the absolute last thing you would expect. Purists will no doubt complain about how far the Mandarin has been taken from his source material, but I've got to say that the version they've come up with here is simply brilliant.

The rest of the plot line is also excellent by summer blockbuster standards. Though it draws on key points from the recent Extremis, Haunted, and World's Most Wanted story arcs, the story here is completely new and rarely predicable, even to those who are well read in the comics. The villains' scheme is truly masterful, and there are some excellent twists and suitably shocking revelations towards the end.

And of course there's plenty of action, and it rocks. By now we've seen that Tony can take on nearly anything in his armor, which is why the movie does the smart thing and forces him to go without for an extended period of time. With only bits and pieces of his tech to help him, the tension is greater and Tony has to rely more on his wit and skill than massive firepower. Of course there are some awesome action scenes when he is suited up, particularly the mid air rescue sequence. And the best has been saved for last in a massive free-for-all involving Tony, Rhodes, Pepper, and more than a dozen sets of armor against the Mandarin's forces.

This is a very fun movie. Robert Downy junior is as awesome as ever, and he's been given a lot to work with. That's not to say that Iron Man 3 is perfect. I never really bought the whole panic attack thing, and I'm not sure the movie needed a pint sized sidekick, though I admit he did produce some good comic relief. And it just didn't feel quite as slick or as evenly paced as the original. But it comes very close, and it's definitely one of the better movies you'll see this summer.

i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.

even though i use to be a comic book fan, i am also a movie fan too! i see this movie in the same light that the critics do and i would actually give this movie an 8. you see, if you just ignore the huge change they made to the main villain compared to the comic, then the movie stands up very well on its own.

come on people, how can you not like a movie with a cast including : will sadler, miguel ferrer, rebecca hall, guy pearce, robert downey jr,don cheadle and more and everybody looked like they were having fun doing this movie. besides that you also have a very strong message about private corporation sponsored custom made terrorists. that is a very real and scary threat, all you need is one big nut-job in a high position to do so.

the special effects are worth a mention, they were spectacular and for people that said it was slow and not enough action, i say phooey, it had as much as the previous two and the pacing i felt was better also.

the movie had a nice intelligent script and very competent actors and if you are a fan of twists in movies, this one has a few.

so...all you iron-man comic book fans have to try to cool off and watch this movie and see and relate to it as a movie and then give your opinion. for me personally, this is the 4th time i've watched the movie and unlike the other comic book movies this one seems to get better with every viewing.

if you were to leave the comic book fans out of the voting( there is a lot of them it seems ) and just leave it to the critics and fans of movies then this movie would at least be an 8 on IMDb.

Or OTT as some like to say/write. And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I'm thankful for that. I was so excited after "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.

Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I'm glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.

But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn't expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another "Black-ish" element that is added to the mix. Though I have to admit, I'm not familiar with the characters of the comic itself, I know this movie did what it was supposed to do ... and then some! Let it entertain you!

To date this is the best Iron man movie without any doubt in my mind. I rarely give movies a rating of 8 and above and I nearly gave this movie a 9. The problem with this movie isn't so much the story or the characters as they all perform beautifully. Tony Stark is as always very well portrayed, Pepper and Warmachine all spot on. The acting is superb and not to be questioned. The visual effects are spot on, the editing however... and here begin the problems. 

I believe that in Iron Man 3 one of two things happened: they either had too much or too little footage. I am willing to bet that they had allot more footage than screen time allowed. Now this is great for later BRD releases with more movie time but it becomes somewhat odd in the cinema. The ending felt very rushed for what would've been a full climactic peek of the series that would sum up Tony's mental and physical struggle with his body and his philosophic battle to overcome an illness by building a shell around to protect him. We have all felt vulnerable once or twice in our life but he depicts a man of a serious illness who if given the chance could be perfectly able to climb to the top of a mountain and back. Due to his health restrictions he pretends to be the super hero rather than actually being one...makes sense? Tony wants to be seen and remembered as a remarkable genius but he has to overplay what he doesn't have in health with that which he has in intellect and character; and so Iron Man is born. Sadly Iron Man 3 does everything right for the most part and when the time finally comes to reach that high peek when things really matter (at the very end of the movie) the scenes rush through and leave you gasping for air. biting the pillow in agony. 

What makes me really angry is the amount of time they spent in the initial build up of the Mandarin (who is a legit comic book villain) only to make him out to be a run of the mill "b class" actor. They would've cut to the point and shortened the early scenes in favor for more time at the end to really see Tony Stark with a healed heart. Maybe we could have a scene where him and peeper watch a sunrise and tears fall out of his eyes, the burden of illness never there anymore, or where he runs on a field not worried that he will pass out or have some type of cardiac arrest... just a little bit more of how his life improves with his new heart, how he escapes the very thing that most people can't escape with chronic illnesses. 

I also didn't like the scene in the plane where Iron Man drops down and save everyone in mid air; dare I say that it didn't feel realistic or believable? There was an absence of real sacrifice as everyone no one really dies and the "bad guys" are more of a nuisance than legit trouble. 

Aside from the mentioned above however, I really did enjoy everything else in the film. There was nothing that was negative about it, I highly recommend this movie and if you're a fan of the trilogy you will certainly love this more than the rest.

For me 8/10 an excellent movie, great visual and auditory experience. Excellent acting, the story works out very well, the flow is superb and although a few issues regarding visual time (for certain scenes) and "belive-ability", in others the overall message of Iron Mans struggle is well understand.

The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.

However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.

And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.

Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).

Go see it. Don't listen to the comic book fanatics who rant and rave because it doesn't follow the comic books. I am an IM movie fanatic and this movie is worth the price of admission.

I have had high expectations of this movie going into it, and I was not disappointed. I have read many of the negative reviews and I want to offset them. I am not a comic book fan and I don't know anything about them. I am an Iron Man/Tony Stark fan because of Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal, the witty writing, and the action. I can even stomach Gwyneth Paltrow for a couple of hours in this movie franchise. I admit, the ending wasn't what I expected, but it was appropriate. It will give viewers that Hollywood version of life.

Spoiler!!!!!!!!!! Read on with mild spoilers.

In real life, if your house blows up and slides into the sea...you don't come back from it. If you are a comic book/movie billionaire, you do. The "Easter Egg" at the end was funny, but no SLJ or teaser for another movie. I was really rooting for Pepper to die, since I hat GP. Oh well. Maybe next time. I admit the comic book fanatics, having read their tirades, know more and care more about sticking to the comic book series, but this movie was awesome and seemed to me to have evolved the story line from adolescence to adulthood. Tony Stark needed to grow up and he did so admirably while retaining that Peter Pan quality we all love. Bottom line: go see it and enjoy it for what it is.

It took me ages to watch this because of all the conflicting reviews. I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.

This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).

Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.

Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.

10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent.

IRON MAN THREE came as a pleasant surprise: better than the second installment, it's a perfect blend of comic book super-heroics and Big screen sensibilities. Robert Downey is at his best. The writing helps. So do the fx, which are 100% believable. (Even seeing the "human chain" dangling over the Cape Fear River when the movie was being shot here didn't prepare me for the sequence: it's mind-boggling.) This was one of the few times that watching the movie was as much fun as reading the comic books. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back. The scene following the end credits was by far the funniest (and the best) of the "tag" scenes. (And Stan Lee's cameo- as a lecherous old man watching a bikini contest- was great.) Hollywood finally got one right...

After watching Joss Whedon's new "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." Pilot, I stuck this in my VLC Playlist and let it roll again. I had seen it a few months back so it was a fresh Experience.

Jon Favreau remained as "Happy Hogan" but he gave the directorial reigns to another actor-turned director, Shane Black (Who was "Hawkins" in "Predator"). This was not a mistake, as this film uses everything from the first two and builds on them, so there is no real flavor of change.

Robert Downey Jr is the same Tony Stark left from Iron Man Two and Avengers, and his dialog with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and "War Machine/The Iron Patriot" (Don Cheadle) is the same argumentative banter as before.

I was expecting the look of Stark's Malibu Residence to change, but no- It's exactly the same, including Stark's robot "DUM-E" (Which sports a Dunce Cap in the beginning of this).

This Story is a marriage of two classic Iron Man themes: "Hands of the Mandarin" and "In Extremis". The Mandarin and The Ten Rings were some of Iron Man's first enemies. But the character of Tony Stark is much the same as it was "In Extremis" - In Iron Man 2, we saw him gulping down "Green Machine" drinks, here, he is having full blown panic attacks, which are impairing his functionality. Last time we also got to see the "Suit in a Briefcase" and these all came from "In Extremis".

But here, all the stops have been pulled out, nothing is held back. I have to admire the sheer difficulty of producing this, it is very hard to pick out CGI, and that's the way it should be.

The greatest thing in here is Pepper, she is less than the Normal Frail "Damsel in Distress", she has already taken over running Stark Industries, she was ready to be more than merely Stark's Secretary or Girlfriend.

We have two unrelated crooks: The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the head of the AIM think-tank, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce). Needless to say, they look great. But one of them is misdirection and cover for the other. Which one? And the fact is, we aren't even guessing this duplicity until it's in our face.

Shaun Toub once again shows up as Ho Yinsen, but it's in a scene of 1999 where Happy has long hair. Remember Yinsen told Stark that he had met him after giving a speech while being drunk: This is that event. Rebecca Hall is Maya Hansen, reminding me of Shelley Duvall. She is another variable in this equation.

The Mandarin is taking credit for a number of bombings around the country, no evidence of Bombs can be found at each of the sites. "When is a Bomb not a Bomb?" - That's what Stark is in the middle of figuring out, but he gets interrupted and sidetracked to Rose Hill, Tennessee.

Where he meets a Kid, Harley Keener who helps him with a "Bully" (James Badge Dale - "Savin"). He also gets to meet a Flame, Stephanie Szostak (Brandt) who has "the hots" for him, but he lets her cool off on a telephone wire.

There are more convolutions in this film there there are in a Brain, well placed and true surprises. It's a rare thing to have that happen in film these days.

More is going on with the character of Stark than the usual explosions, Repulsor blasts, and arguments with Pepper and Happy. His previous behavior had created Demons that he has to contend with here. He has to be Iron Man without the benefit of his Armor. But that's how he became Iron Man in the first place. So he's back to digging himself out of a hole with his mind rather than gadgets, although he has to visit a hardware store and make a few gadgets.

The merging of the two story lines has created an alternate reality from the Comics, where Mandarin was a different character than this. But the use of The Mandarin here, shows influence all the way back to the first Iron Man movie so there is internal consistency in the three efforts.

The trick with these Marvel Movies is creating action shots where iconic imagery from the comics can be used. In all four Spider Man films, these are the poses of Spidey as we web-slings across New York's Skyline. With Thor, it is the Image of him holding out his Hammer in Mid-Flight. Here, it is the image of Iron Man's Crumpled Headpiece on the ground in the middle of a flame, as well as his default pose with fist striking the ground. This movie gives us plenty of those images.

Rebecca Mader excels as another Bad Girl, look for other cameos.

I enjoyed all three movies in this franchise, so far this has been my favorite. Now all we need is a 4th movie where he has to fight Ultimo.

Iron man 3 is not completely fresh in my mind considering I saw the movie over a month a go, but it was a movie to remember.

Iron Man 3 was the first movie on my list of anticipated movies for summer 13, and I thought it was a delight. Robert Downey Jr. was great in the suit as usual. He steals every scene, charms you, and is an overall funny guy. War machine ( haha) had good chemistry with stark and remained a relevant supporting character.

I am a big Guy Pearce fan! I loved him in movies such as: memento, hurt locker, and la confidential. He was good as an actor in this film, but I felt they could have made him a little deeper of a villain. Which brings us to the supposed downfall of this film. The Mandarin. Die hard fans of the Mandarin will be disappointed as ever by the mandarin in Iron Man 3. He appears as a large threat and as a ruthless terrorist in the first half of the film. Halfway through the movie you actually find out he is a drunken actor. In the end, no one can deny Iron Man 3, unless your a Mandarin purist. 9/10

Human beings have always tried to see beyond the future. We extend our imagination beyond our limits. And when any movie offers a visual treat showing some of the best science fiction stuff, we just love to enjoy watching it. Isn't it? Iron Man 3 offers just the same. After Avengers thrilled our eyes, Iron Man 3 gives us a fabulous treat by taking the Iron man technology to the next level. Frankly, Iron man 2 didn't offer much of the variety in terms of entertainment. It felt like just continuation of Iron Man 1. But Iron Man 3 takes the suit to the next level and gives a completely different entertainment factor. Movie starts with glimpses of Stark's past that would establish its connection with the main story. Main story starts with the terror threats and series of bomb explosions executed by a terrorist named 'Mandarin'. Story also introduces in parallel a scientist working on human DNA upgrading. Tony is developing new versions of his Iron Man suit. Soon circumstances project Stark as a rival of Mandarin. Movie offers many unexpected turn of events and some eye-catching visual effects as it progresses. Some of the scenes like demolition of Stark's home, Stark rescuing people from plane crash and fight of Iron men army are unforgettable. RDJ is awesome as usual. It feels like he is not acting but he is Iron man himself. Among others, Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic appearance. Though the role is short, it offers lots of shades in his characters. In all I would say, this is a must watch movie for fabulous special effects, awesomely eccentric RDJ, good story and a nice climax. Don't miss this one.

Iron Man 3 (2013) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Iron Man trilogy. It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn't boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn't ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style! 

I am defending this film against haters. I know a lot of people who will see my review will put it down, just like 30 people put down my review Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)! First off this film isn't Die Hard With A Vengeance or Lethal Weapon film even tough Tony and Rhodes are fighting with guns without their armors. I love the film because it is serious it has Action. Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful performance as Pepper un like she did in Iron Man 2. And yes fans I am saying it. She was so damn annoying in Iron Man 2, I disliked watching her in that movie, in this film she is a supporting and caring girlfriend unlike Iron Man 2.

I love this film because The film sets place after the events of The Avengers on Christmas Eve!!! Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. This is the first time I see Tony Stark and Iron Man in a snow in Christmas, This film reminds me on Batman Returns (1992) Tim Burton's film. It is pretty good. The attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! There was kid in this film and no he wasn't annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the "Mandarin"! that was brilliant and I love the twist!

Tony Stark, is proved in this third and more than likely final chapter in the solo run of Iron Man. Iron Man 3 or Three as it appears in the end credits amps up the action and closes out the trilogy on a high note setting Tony's eventual return in summer 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. But in his most darkest moments he is challenged by his emotions of what happened to him in New York, while dealing with the biggest threat he has encountered: Mandarin. Without given any plot points away for those who may have not seen this, but Iron Man 3 is well worth the admission and then some. People Iron Man 3 sets up Marvel's Phase 2 of features. 

This is the best Iron Man movie yet, better than Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Loved the storyline and Tony was a genius and brilliant again as usual. Great special effects. A very busy, action- and humour-packed comic-book flick. Better than Iron Man 2, but not nearly as good as the original. As usual, Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) rocked, as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here.

When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution.

Iron Man 3 (stylized on screen as Iron Man Three) is a 2013 superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

9/10 Score: A Studio: Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley Director/Shane Black Producer: Kevin Feige Screenplay: Drew Pearce, Shane Black Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 10 Mins.

Warning: spoiler alerts:

It was have been few months after The Avengers. New York City is once again saved. The hero himself has experience a lot hard times in his mind. He can't just quit and suddenly there is new terror. The mysteries leader named the Mandarin came to the town with his terrorist. The city needs once again Iron Man. But this even him can't to do nothing and he have to leave New York to create the plan to stop the Mandarin

Robert Downey Jr is always fantastic and Iron Man 3 offered more than action scenes. The script is not just full of the effects and the fighting. Like the first film, the hero is vulnerable and that is good thing.

"Some call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. America. Ready for another lesson?"  the Mandarin

Ben Kingsley is bullseye for the movie. His performance was good and memorable. His voice created "Darth Vader vibes". Ben's performance radiate such a power that hopefully the audience remember his role. Even that the twist got "huh?" feelings but it definitely not made the role worse. Its just tell how smart the story is. I like that the villains are not one-dimensional the characters. 

Overall the cast is perfect as usually in Iron Man movies. Gwyneth Paltrow showed more than the skin. She did good job and the script offered more than scream and the hero saves in every scenes. She actually acted and was equal with Downey Jr and others. Example The Amazing Spider-Man crew should take advice that how can write good role for female. Don Cheadle's performance was smooth and perfect partner to Tony Stark. I would see him War Machine solo film.

The special effects looked cool, realistic and the crew doesn't went to over-the-top. Only the final battle needed more imagination. But still the movie is smart and effects are better than in Man of Steel movie. Marvel Studio films are like one big movie. That' why we have to look these movies with a bigger scales. The first Iron Man saved Downey Jr career and he has taken recently many different roles. I think that this was his final Iron Man solo movie to him.

Iron Man 3 is the perfect ending to the Iron Man trilogy. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Hollywood bosses should think more than twice that do they want continue with the character or bring new the characters to the big screens. I feel that Downey Jr will look another projects after The Avenger 3. His performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man Is so memorable that it will hard to any actor replace the role.

I enjoyed the first Iron Man film and the Avengers. The second one was alright. This one is just excellent.

A lot of the negativity here seems to stem from the fact that the 'Mandarin' is meant to be some kind of evil wizard in the comics and he is not in this. That sounds completely ludicrous. If that genuinely is the plot of the comic books then it only reinforces the reasons I have never got into them. The portrayal of his character in this film is genuinely clever and touches on some proper world issues. If he had 'magic rings' it would have been a total joke and if it stuck to what he apparently is in the comic books then this film would be quite dreadful as a result.

Another complaint appears to be related to the film focusing more on Tony Stark than Iron Man. Personally this is the reason I found the film so good. Superheroes are kind of silly and I never had any interest in the subject until the modern films which bring them down to Earth a bit. You only have to watch an old Batman film where they are just running about in brightly coloured spandex and compare it to the more modern ones to see this much.

In this film Tony Stark feels like a genuine person. He overcomes weakness before he can triumph as Iron Man and it is ultimately his creations which save the day and not him. In this way it feels like the story has grown up and come full circle. I actually found it surprisingly poignant at times whilst still being a clever and enthralling story.

If this were just two hours of Iron Man flying about the place shooting at stuff as so many people seem to have wanted judging by the reviews then it would be pretty boring. This is sort of one of the issues that the second film had. You knew he would win out and he essentially had an arsenal of super weapons to hand so there was no question as to how that would play out. This film has him facing genuine adversity.

I cannot find fault with this film. People are ticking off a huge list of issues with writing, acting and even the music. In reality they are just hurt because it is not true to their precious comic books. I can understand that to a degree. I hate the Hitchhikers Guide film because it simply does not live up to the books or radio series. However when your complaint is that the super villain isn't some kind of genie I think you have to reassess your stance. If the Mandarin was the same as in the comic books then this film would have been dreadful. Seriously dreadful. I mean properly ridiculous.

As it stands I would say this is the best film of the trilogy and easily on a par with the Avengers.

After being totally thrilled by The Avengers, I didn't expect exactly the same amount of greatness in "Iron Man 3", yet I still needed a solid story to keep me interested. There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.

The plot consists of a terrorist called the Mandarin threatening America's safety and teaching its president and people a lesson. After his friend Happy Hogan is put into a coma thanks to one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony vows to strike back. But after an attack from his enemy leaves him homeless and weaponless, Tony must find a way to stop his foe's plans while reevaluating his troubled existence. Downey Jr. hits the ball park once again with his Stark character showing his usual playful charm, but also his vulnerability at times. The events that took place in The Avengers take a heavy toll on the character and RDJ plays it quite professionally. Other characters were sort of a bore to me with Pearce's Killian as an exception. The plot once again fails to make sense, making it more comparable with the second rather than the first. Overall the film entertains and the visuals combined with the leading man's appeal make for an enjoyable time, however when it comes to the story it doesn't come close to Marvel movies like the first Iron Man and The Avengers.

I thought that Iron Man 3 was a smash hit! The movie shows that Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. is truly a superhero, and shows that he does a lot more heroic qualities of Tony Stark. The previous Iron Man films were shown by the perspective stand point of Iron Man, but in this film shows a lot more of Tony Stark. 

The special effects of IM3 was amazing! It made everything just come to life, it made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the movie. The special effects also made the movie so much more suspenseful and intense, I didn't want to stop watching it! This movie is now one of my favorites!

The director of this film called: " Iron Man 3 " is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****

The film is really good its has plenty of action adventure and humour. The budget was $200 million and the Box office was over billion which shows the success of the film.

The film beings with a flashback on one New Year's Eve Tony Starks humiliates Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce. Years later explosions happen in America which leaves Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who was Starks body guard and directed Iron Man 1 and 2,in a coma, Tony threatens the people behind it, which then leads to his home being destroyed, he then finds the people who are responsible after taking him and Pepper Potts hostage. All he has to fight with is his new prototype MK42.

The director of Iron Man is Shane Black who is known for his films based on Christmas, and started the film on New Years Eve which is around Christmas time. 

One good thing about this film are the Visual effects. Also, the humour used in the film keeps the film entertaining. The tension created also contributes to making this film worth to watch. And relationship with Harley, who was the young boy, shows emotional side of Stark which helps us understand the character more.

One bad thing about this film is the uncovering of the Madrian because some of the audience may be expecting a real villain. Also before the film came out the teasers shown people dying and more action but didn't happen as much in the film. The ending of the film is disappointing as it ended and resolved itself quickly.

Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, "things are different now, and I'm a different man". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.

Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in "The Avengers", and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.

For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.

What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.

Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed. 

In short, Iron Man 3 is the worst of the film and it does have some flaws, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It's both a blazingly exciting action epic and a character study that deconstructs Tony Stark's character very cleverly. Even if you find tons of things wrong with the sooty, you'll still enjoy it for the fun it offers.

"Tony Stark" (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in "The Avengers". Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of "the Mandarin" (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife "Pepper Potts" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and "President Ellis" (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of "Aldrich Killian" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see "The Avengers" or possibly one of the other two "Iron Man" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can. In any case, I believe this sequel was a notch above the preceding "Iron Man" movies and I have rated it accordingly.
