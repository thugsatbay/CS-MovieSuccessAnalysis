### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!

I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.

The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as "Hellboy 2" and "Pan's Labyrinth". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.

Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.

The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.

I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here.

This film is a TRUE fairy tale. It's dark. It's raw. And it's written from the dark, raw experience of women. 

Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog. It's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.

The critics complaining about this film want "fairy tales" to stay in the same "one-love-fits-all" mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find "romantic" love and marry a "good" Prince or Princess, and you will live "happily ever after," safe from any pain or sorrow. But real life is a lot messier than that.

It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! 

No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster, no matter what the critics say.

And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge, destroying their enemies and...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we are sold in every other "action" and "adventure" film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.

Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us. This is one such film.

Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece.

Don't miss it.

Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not clich√©, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.

A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all ages, truly a masterpiece.

I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty, since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice, she had the look, her costume was spot-on, and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly (and really, who could replace Eleanor Audley?). But one thing I've noticed over the past 10-15 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus, rather than story or character development. In the movie, Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.

This movie does not explain why Maleficent is the way she is. Disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as Disney's most iconic villain. Now they're trying to say that Maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil. But that never happens. She becomes angry and bitter, but not evil. Maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood, sympathetic character. She is a total victim who never becomes evil at all.

Oh, she does do one evil thing; she does still curse King Stefan's baby out of revenge. And she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward. See? Not evil at all. And while I'm at it, I should mention my distaste for the way she cursed Aurora: Disney completely lowered the stakes by having Maleficent utter the words "sleep-like death" and be the one to offer the cure of True Love's kiss. No! It's MERRYWEATHER that counters the DEATH curse in order to save Aurora's life! Oh, Maleficent may say later that she doesn't believe True Love exists, but that's a matter of opinion isn't it? Again, LOWERS THE STAKES.

And what was Linda Woolverton thinking when she took King Stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make Maleficent look good? If you're going to show us the point of view of a famous villain, it's okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi- dimensional, even to show they weren't always evil. But NOT to say they were never evil at all; that just completely defeats the point of the character! Same with the good guys; they may have their own flaws, show that they have their own prejudices, or that everything they did wasn't perfect. But NOT to say "the good guys were really EVIL OR STUPID!"

The fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather (I refuse to call them by their new names) are NOTHING like they were in Sleeping Beauty, and this is a big deal. In Sleeping Beauty, say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping Aurora SAFE. At least they tried, even if they failed! Maleficent (2014) portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins. Aurora was just a means to an end for them; they have no relationship with her like they do in the original. The movie also took away their own personalities, so they are no different from each other. I can't even keep track of which fairy has which name! Watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as I expected it to be. 

King Stefan has to be one of worst written villains I have seen in a while. He has no real motivation for what he does; we see him as having nothing in the beginning, and then the movie glosses over his relationship with Maleficent in order to "get to the good part" where he steals her wings in order to be king. After that, he wages war on Maleficent for cursing his daughter, and yet he only looks at Aurora as afterthought property. Why is he even after Maleficent then? What else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter?

Elle Fanning as Aurora was very impressive. I do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original, and she stole the film in every scene she was in. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save the movie, nor were Maleficent's interactions with Diaval, as enjoyable as they were. 

And of course, Maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie. I have to ask; why, Disney? You knew how loved of a villain Maleficent is, and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why. Also, we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant; you didn't use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with live-action CGI? Why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? Besides the fact that Maleficent is not evil in this film, she also is very wimpy and pathetic. She can't do ANYTHING. When we see her fight an army at the beginning, all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings. The tree monsters did most of her fighting for her. In Sleeping Beauty, she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds, she could shoot lightning from her staff, and she could transform into another form other than her own. She didn't do any of that in this movie. 

Just like with Alice in Wonderland, Disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the live-action screen. Maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie I've seen, but it's definitely in my bottom list now.

With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and Jack and the beanstalk, both of which I was highly entertained and thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. 

Pros: Visually stunning. Angelina Jolie's performance was spot on with the most evil of classical villains we always knew. 

Cons: The most beautiful princess Aurora looks like the girl next door. Why does Hollywood try to do that is beyond me. Mary Jane Watson (Spidermans love interest) is supposed to be a beautiful actress and a model. But again the movie portrays a girl next door look in ultimate Spiderman. Elle Fannig's acting was not strong and in the end not memorable in the least. It felt like she was there for the sake of being there.

Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed. ______________ ______________

The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the start of where the movie just becomes a drag. 

Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. 

Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. 

The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies (it feels like pointless fillers). Also when the princess realizes whats going on one day before her birthday, the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were not incompetent, just funny in the original story and smart enough to hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so incompetent and negligent is beyond me.

Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a chick flick geared at young children (visuals) and adults who are romantically inclined. 

The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. 

Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen completely immersed in the plot. 

This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting (emotionless) drawn from twilight.

Maleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement.

The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land scenes resemble a pre Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic CGI. The right blend of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too animated. The director Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did an even better job here.

Angelina Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character - it is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her cheekbones to make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming. Elle Fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and Brenton Thwaites plays her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple and Imelda Staunton are cute too.

Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror Mirror' and 'Snow White and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit silly and the second was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and fairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year.

Let me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many interpretations, she has simply been Evil (yes, with a capital E). So forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.

In this adaptation, she is reinterpreted as a good fairy (because she's apparently not a human sorceress anymore?) that simply has a hissyfit. She is certainly not evil - just angry for a little while. She even ends up becoming a Godmother??

Even King Stephen's character is butchered. Why does he go insane over her? If he were really the bad guy, why wouldn't he have killed Maleficent when he had the chance? What possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter?

Speaking of Aurora, it's worth mentioning that she is relatively alright, but still not too close to her original character. A petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color, which is really distracting. 

Additionally, they rehash the concept from Frozen, which is that 'True Love' doesn't have to be from some man. If this trend continues from Disney, all we'll see is sisterly/Godmotherly/family love movies where Romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesn't end with a "happily ever after" anymore.

Overall, this film was simply horrible if you respected Maleficent as a villain. If you did like Maleficent as she was, I don't recommend seeing this movie. Even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as Evil, I urge you not to see this movie. Don't support the people who made it.

I have waited a long time for this film and it did not disappoint!

The film is very entertaining with stunning visuals and impressive action scenes. This is definitely Angelina's film and she is incredible as Maleficent.

Supporting cast are also impressive and Elle was perfect casting for Aurora. The 3d was also good and really did enhance many scenes. The score by James Newton Howard really blew me away and adds magic to the film.

My screening was all made up of adults which surprised me. The trailers for the film really give the film a dark tone, however the actual film has many light Disney moments. 

I highly recommend this film and the 3d is worth paying a bit extra!

Maleficent is the very first movie, in my long list of movies that I have seen, that I wanted to walk out of.

Lets start with the positives. Angelina Jolie was incredible. She was beautiful, she was strong, and she executed Maleficent beautifully. Her relationship with Aurora was refreshing and.... Nice. The magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia, but it was still beautiful and engaging.

But all of this does not save the movie. I expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked, where we get a better understanding of the bad guy. Yes, us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done, but we can see where they come from. In the musical Wicked (and even in the movie great and powerful Oz) we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy. We could see where she was coming from. In those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming "the bad guy". Most were victims of circumstances. In Maleficent? It was ferngully/Avatar all over again. Magical people, good! Man, BAAAAAAD! Instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty, suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil Maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her! He was given NO aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy, not the smallest bit of understanding. He was just a vile man that broke Maleficents heart, mutilated her, and cared only for power. Even when he tried to protect his daughter, it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved. Yes, he graveled for her for a bit, begging Maleficent not to curse her, but that was it. The movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it. OK, it had some of the good of humanity, but the only human that was portrayed as good was Aurora.

The movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief, but ended up just portraying them as idiots, incompetent selfish creatures. The fairies in the original Disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child, but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life. If were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand, then yes, we would be as lost as they were. But they were given 16 years to evolve, to learn and to grow. But no. The fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie. They were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie.

I mentioned before that I liked the relationship that Maleficent and Aurora had in the movie, but even that was shattered later on in the movie. The solution to the problem was not a surprise at all. It was taken straight out of Frozen. It was refreshing and incredible when Frozen did it, because it was the first time Disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of "true love", but when the same solution, the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? It is boring and in no way exiting, it is in no way entertaining. We have learned NOTHING new. Is this Disney's new approach in relationship? Love between man and a woman is obsolete, but the love between girl (family kind of love, not lesbian, kids apparently can't handle that, and also, family excludes male family members at this moment as well, only women can feel true love!)is the strongest of all the loves in this world.

In the end, the movie basically told the audience "yeah, the movie/story that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda, and I should know, because I am Queen Aurora, and I was there all along!" The original Sleeping Beauty was rather black and white, good VS.. Evil. When I walked in to the theatre I expected the lines to be blurred, to be thought "all stories have two sides, not all of our actions are blatantly good OR evil" but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible. The good creatures are good no matter what they do, and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way.

In conclusion: The movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character, but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain, just switching the genders around. The worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing, but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the end.

***Spoliers may be listed below****

Maleficent is a an iconic villainous role. She is one of Disney's best characters cast from the dark side and when I saw the trailer I succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using Jolie as the sinister evil fairy. I was seduced to believing that I would be lured into a world of evil and treachery. I wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted. I wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness, rooting for the bad girl. I knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and Disney magic, but what I did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself. 

Jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of Maleficent it is beautiful. Once you add in Goldie Locks however, you get a recipe for disaster. Suddenly I might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust, leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling Aurora. 

Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned, this should have been the driving force behind the film. The beginning scenes of a youthful Maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable. To fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison. It must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings. They said years passed and yet I felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to Maleficent's destiny.

In Disney's Rapunzel the "mother" figure who raised Rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter. She was still greedy, evil and dedicated to her path. So why must the world's most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted Godmother of a vapid child. I know Disney is trending this "don't bet on the prince" idea and that's fine I support that, but really...they thought this was "no truer love." 

If they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his child's demise then they are sadly mistaken. That was child's play. A woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her play-book that can make a man suffer. Madness would have been the king knowing that Maleficent knew the entire time where Aurora was hiding. Maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept. He should have been physically and mentally destroyed, a raving lunatic. 

I would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story. That only the raven knew all along where Aurora was and hid it from his mistress. We could watch the anger burn and grow within Maleficent because she wasn't able to find the child for 16 years. That in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that Maleficent discovers her location through some fool's errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her, absconds with the child and let's the curse play out its course. Then I would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king, let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved. Then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves Maleficent's side to try and wake Aurora. When Maleficent discovers her minion's treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death! That would have at least been something!

Then they could have there happier ever after. Then all those still shots of Maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque, more visually twisted. 

Overall, I feel I paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the Prozac and Xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good, vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends. It's a snooze and a travesty. If you love the traditional iconic role of Maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film.

If you like fairy tales and believe in love then you'll hate this film. It's beautifully filmed and well acted by Angelina Jolie, but the story is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous.

By the end of the film I just started laughing at how insane it was. Made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have suffered the worst break up in history, or else she just really hated men.

I was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in theaters. Now I wish I had my money back.

Some may say this film is like Frozen. That's only if we discovered Christoff was actually in league with the evil Prince and Olaf was their spy.

Last year, I made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch Frozen in theaters because I thought it would be a great Disney classic (like Tangled). Finally, I can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as Frozen. Thanks to my terrible experience with Disney's Frozen, I read the entire plot for this movie before watching it. Thankfully, I ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie, like Frozen, was not worth paying to watch. Maleficent was basically a non-animated, non-musical version of Frozen. Apparently Disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from Frozen with different characters! WONDERFUL. As expected, the main point was a rehash of Frozen's "true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman" because it sells well. 

After this movie, I can officially say that Disney has completely lost its magic. We are now to believe that dream guys don't exist. In fact, all men are either extremely evil or just stupid. What happened to the brave Prince Charming in classic Disney stories? Disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more 'realistic' movies nowadays and by 'realistic', I mean movies with strong, independent females who are clearly superior to the men. Disney's recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of 'true love' or dreams anymore. I grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy Prince Charming. BUT WAIT. The people at Disney had an epiphany: having high expectations for guys is BAD. Instead, let's encourage little girls to dream of being BFFs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her father's worst enemy's god-daughter instead! I'm just thankful I don't have to grow up watching these lame Disney movies.

I truly find Disney's efforts in reversing its reputation of true love's kiss just pathetic. Hmm... cynicism in fairy tales? Just what we need. As a classic Disney lover, count me out!

Just a few comments:

1) Prince Phillip used to be my FAVORITE Disney prince, but here, I guess he's just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats.

2) Maleficent DOESN'T turn into a dragon. Yup, you heard me. What's the point of the movie then, you ask? I have no idea. Also, as you have probably already guessed, there's no intense battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent-as-a-dragon either. Just splendid.

3) WHY ON EARTH IS KING STEFAN THE VILLAIN? He was infatuated with Maleficent and only married Queen Leila to take over the kingdom?! What on earth has Disney come to?!?!?! This movie is an insult to Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Stefan>Maleficent. #TeamStefanforlife

4) Last, but definitely not least: what's up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? (Yes, Frozen, I'm also looking at you.) This is by far my biggest issue with recent Disney movies. I'm sure Walt Disney is rolling in his grave. (Actually, since he was cremated, perhaps I should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? Either way, you get the idea.)

"Of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil, none has ever been so inspirational to me as Sleeping Beauty." - Walt Disney

I hate to say it, but Disney is dead. Walt Disney, however, will forever live on in our hearts.

Went to the theater, expecting to experience the dark side of Angelina Jolie who plays a vengeful fairy with lofty wings and left the theater feeling astonished by how beautifully the movie has changed my perspective towards the antagonist.

The remake of the classic Disney movie, "Sleeping Beauty" timely and soundly pans out by wonderfully depicting both beautiful and gloomy sides of fairy land of Maleficent that feud with selfish humans. The Visual effects and acting are so magnificent that mysterious creatures and the cast look totally in sync. The plot naturally goes along with coherent and succinct narrations that add an in-depth storytelling. Not to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without boredom. 

There are a lot more to feel, enjoy, and learn from what I would call, "One of the most underrated movies of the year" based on how the score is given. Not a Disney movie fan? Doesn't like a female protagonist? I don't think it will matter because once you start watching, you will be mesmerized by the imposing world and the ambivalent emotion of Maleficent.

The movie is not worth, keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse. Is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece. Incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the Sleeping Beauty (Disney) is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations. 

I was very looking forward to see the movie since Disney has a good record on movies, although some of the last one has not been very good, including this one. But for example if you saw Frozen you though Disney is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed thru time. 

This movie Maleficent is not one of them, you won't be attract to even repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story Maybe if Disney Management could use the imagination so much they promote to young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever heard before and could sell it. But for what reason will Disney Corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time years after years mom to girl, princess to princess beautiful story, where the Prince rescue the Princess, The King Father and Queen Mother love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy by the goodness. 

And them the Prince and Princes Leave Happily Ever After. 

If only Mr. Walt Disney were alive to see of what His Disney World has become.

I had my doubts before, but now I am sure if it.

Disney has sold out. 

Recently Disney has been releasing films that, whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not, have been paint-by-numbers at best. Films like The Lone Ranger, Thor The Dark World, and Frozen. Yes, Frozen. It's the same Disney crap you've seen over and over, people. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Disney. But not THIS Disney... one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck. Yes, you heard right. Disney did stoop that low. I should have known that this film would be garbage from the get-go when they hired Alice in Wonderland writer Melissa Woolverton to pen the screenplay and Alice in Wonderland production designer Robert Stromberg to direct (Are you sensing a pattern here?) Let's touch on that for a moment-- The Mouse House, in its infinite wisdom, got a PRODUCTION DESIGNER/VFX SUPERVISOR WHO HAD NEVER DIRECTED ANYTHING TO DIRECT THEIR $200 MILLION BLOCKBUSTER. As a result, Maleficent's beautiful visuals carry no weight, and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost. Because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? Even Angelina Jolie can't pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself. What really sank this movie for me was Disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the "true love" twist from Frozen. Literally THE EXACT SAME TWIST. I have no problem with Disney creating a strong independent heroine... but if you're going to do that, Don't have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie! In short, Disney has definitely lost its magic, and it's going to be tough to get it back. Don't listen to the positive reviews. Remember how glowing Alice in Wonderland's were when it first came out? You have been warned.

This movie is a complete joke, the only thing going for it is the visual effects, In the 1959 Disney classic Maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all!

Also I want to write in some details why I did not like this movie and why the story was very weak in my opinion. First why is King Stefan evil? why did he send Aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day.

and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots! the good fairies are idiots? and Prince Philip is not the true love of Aurora? what nonsense! finally the motherly kiss of Maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place!

and finally Maleficent kills Stefan (Aurora's father) and Aurora is happy about that? what the hell?

Really a silly movie, I gave it 2/10 just because of the CGI which Hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and casting!

I am very mixed about this film. Firstly, as many critics have singled out, I must praise Angelica's acting, mainly as the first good, then evil Maleficent. Now, while I could feel a little sorry for her being unable to bring this curse off Aurora, having to see, one of my best villains, Maleficent turn back into good is just unnatural. It ends up looking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake of young girls, who is only a little part of the audience, avoiding simple but effective scares and risks, basically throwing out what many Disney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes parts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course, most people don't rush into romantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making traditional relationships in past films happen, even though this is what happened in the era the film is set, is just horrid. I mean no offence to Frozen at all, since it is one of my most favourite Disney films of all time. But stealing the concept of real "true love" from Frozen is pathetic. If it wasn't for Disney with its stupid audience research, it could have easily looked even further into the darkness of Maleficent, which is almost no such thing in this film.

This movie fails to show why a remake was necessary. It fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall. It also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one Hollywood Star. 

The female-female-relationship as central point rather than the male- female-relationship is nothing new since Frozen. In fact, Prince Philip, who is even more one-dimensional than his cartoon-version, is still there at the end to be the one and only. Considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between Aurora's real parents and "adoptive parents" just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about. Aurora's mother dies off-screen and nobody, not her husband, not her daughter ever seem to take any notice. Just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie.

Not only the Queen and the young Prince are loosing screen-time and depth, the three good fairies in the Original had personalities, while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor. The third fairy never actually was able to give her wish. The movie never explains this plot whole. 

Maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of Angelina Jolie in a movie about Angelina Jolie. No character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought. They are all background for more Angelina Jolie. 

Overall I am deeply disappointed. If you compare the old "Sleeping Beauty" with the new movie you can see the Disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing. 

Don't watch it with your children, they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies. Don't watch it for the sake of nostalgia, because it's unable to provide the same quality it used to, before 3D was able to overcome any plot wholes. And don't watch it for the sake of crafty 3D. The same expected shots of flying, sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again. You will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitively.

Didn't expect a masterpiece going in, but exited realizing "Maleficent" is one of the best, most beautiful films I've ever experienced.

It is superlative in every way; executed with meticulous care by experts at every level: screen writing, casting, art direction, cinematography, production design, producing, lighting design, CGI, stunt coordination, acting and directing.

Shot after stunningly lit and composed shot, the film is a visual classic from opening to fadeout. If you know even a few basics of how things are done, there are moments where your jaw drops open - and stays there - in amazed appreciation for what this team accomplishes.

It veers delicately, sometimes like lightning, from warmth to laughs to concern to sorrow to tears to majesty and back again; building, building to one moment (just before the magnificent climax) that you suddenly know / hope is coming - about ten seconds before it does - which makes it even more magical and earns your gratitude for what they've done with this timeless fairy tale.

Every inch of the huge 3D screen displays an unbelievably rich collaboration in the joys of virtuoso film making destined to last as long as Disney's original, delivered by artists at the top of their crafts.

Above them all: the remarkable Angelina Jolie (who also co-executive produced).

A milestone in its genre!

Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!

Round-Up: Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore, but when she comes out of the woodwork, she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted, she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life, I'm not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley, who played the crow, and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally, I don't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares, but there are some scenes they will enjoy, like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all, I'm surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn't expecting something so dark.

Budget: $180million Worldwide Gross: $757million (WOW!)

I recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney movies which are based on the concept of Cinderella. 7/10

I am a Disney fan. A pure Disney fan. Currently, I have taken it upon myself to watch every animated feature Disney produced in preparation for going to Disney World in August. I know information about nearly every film, flaws, mistakes, how they did certain things, who voiced what parts, etc. I love Disney.

I love Sleeping Beauty the most of all this Disney films for one reason - the art style. It is beautiful. Eyvind Earle was phenomenal as the art director, and I believe Walt's decision to create a "moving tapestry" as it was described, created some of the most under-appreciated sequences in the movie (ie the opening sequence was originally going to be much more like the "Belle" in the opening of Beauty and the Beast, and the cake baking scene with the three fairies was originally going to end in an explosion) Regardless, this movie touched a part of my artistic mind (I'm an illustrator) and opened the door for me as an artist to view the Disney films in a different light.

When I heard that they were making a live-action retelling of it, from Maleficent's perspective, I was elated. Learning that this was likely due to the popularity of "Wicked" I was even more elated. I had read the book (NOT the play) and had loved the treatment Elphaba received. I was only concerned, at the time, about one thing - how were they going to recreate the iconic art-style in alive-action retelling?

That was the least of my concerns when exiting the theater.

This "retelling" was not a retelling a la Wicked or even Snow White and the Huntsman, it was through and through a love story, akin to Frozen. In fact, it WAS Frozen, again - with the same twist ending that already feels clich√© because Disney did it in two films back to back. 

What's the problem? Maleficent is not Maleficent, the fairies are not the fairies, Phillip is shoe-horned in, and Stefan is the villain because despite trying to give the original villain dimension, we still need a one-dimensional villain. 

This is a "lover scorned" story. Maleficent is mad a Stefan so she "curses" his child. I put curses in quotes because she softens it so much, it may as well be a bedtime story. That's right, in this version, SHE makes it a death-like sleep, so the fairies do nothing. Strike one. The fairies? They must have gotten the lobotomized versions of the fairies for this film, who have no plan, no knowledge (despite being self-described as "good with children") and no understanding of what they need to do as guardians of a child. Strike two. The movie shoe-horns in Prince Phillip as a pretty boy cameo with no real purpose.

Maleficent, in the end, turns her RAVEN into a dragon (because... why?) Strike three After this, she is a horned catwoman in latex fighting the "real" villain, Stefan, to his death, and the entire story is stupid, botched, and boring. Out of strikes, you should die now

Why anyone likes this movie or thinks it is not clich√© is beyond me. It is the epitome of clich√© as it is a replicated storyline from Frozen. "Familial" love is true love, here, again. What this fails to understand is what made Wicked actually INTERESTING was not the complete change of the character of the Wicked Witch, but the explanation behind it. Elphaba still does all the things she ever DID do in the canon of the stories and the movie. She is angry at Dorothy for killing her sister and taking the shoes. Without context, and from Doroty's perspective, she seems evil. From HER perspective, and WITH context, it's not less WRONG that she's mad at Dorothy, but you understand why she IS. At the core, you must not change the actions the character makes in explaining how the character was "not so evil" without completely changing the reasons WHY the character was then called evil, negating the reason for the original story or the retelling altogether.

The only thing worth seeing, in this movie, is the CGI. It is beautifully done. Although, I found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling... I would give it an 8 for the CGI. But the movie... Well, that's quite another story.

They haven't 'respected the classic' the original story. If so, Maleficent would be evil. The original is a story of good vs. evil, right vs. might and a lesson that love conquers all. But rather than that simple formula... THIS is a story of a jilted/betrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child. To me... that is NOT respecting the original story AND it didn't bring us what we 'love about this story'. It isn't 'a different, but classic fairy tale'. The formula for a 'Classic' fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil. This one muddles all the way through.

I didn't see ANYTHING in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original. Only the names and the spindle. It was just a dark and horrible story... I wouldn't bring my kids to see it. This isn't a lesson of good's triumph over evil... this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior. Instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong... it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks it's fair or even worse... can't be helped. This anti-hero worship mentality is not what ANY child needs and is the ruin of our society. "Let's root for the bad guy! Let's understand the bad guy! The bad guy IS the hero!" 

"No one is truly bad... everyone who does evil has a 'backstory' that made them that way. Pity the refuse of society. The things they do are either learned or they were born that way... but either way... they are justified or can't help it. We should never blame or judge anyone's behavior as truly bad, because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided. Don't blame me... others actions MADE me do it. I am right in whatever I do, when I feel I have been wronged. Two wrongs don't make it right, it makes it fair. Everything is excusable so long as I can think of an excuse."

So, first, she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself. It would seem she is always right regardless because, right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day... so long as she 'felt' it was right, at the time... she was never wrong. No matter what she was doing... she was always right. She was just a victim of some selfish man. 

"Men are putzes and men are evil." Show me one decent male role model in this story. Her companion was a weak tool governed by her, his apparent 'feminine side' was his only saving grace. The prince was just a pretty face, shallow and likely governed by his hormones. The king was a user, a phony... governed by his greed. The message here is... "Women don't need men. Men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions. Women should be strong and not be fooled by a man's affections. When people do bad, it must have been for a good reason and really isn't wrong of them. Bad behavior doesn't warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion. Any attempt at a classic good vs. evil concept... only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of "women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak". 

To conclude this story, somehow, meant to convey that 'Love conquers all' is a sham. This movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe. This movie is unfit for children. No 'beauty' appears in this dark tale... Alas! It must have been 'sleeping'.Ôªø

I am certain Mr. Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave... AGAIN and AGAIN over stuff like this.

This totally DESTROYED the Disney Original... It basically told every viewer, flat out... You were lied to. The first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you, they have been lying about Maleficent for ages. Poor Maleficent... Evil parents! What other lies have your parents told you? Santa? The Easter Bunny? How dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters... they don't exist. Bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie. 

Mr. Disney would have NEVER done that and certainly NEVER would have approved. Fantasies, hopes, dreams, imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all costs.

As a man who prefers science fiction to fantasy, I was pleasantly surprised by this superb film. It is a re-imagining of the classic fairy tale 'sleeping beauty' (at least I think so, as I have never read the original tale in the original language, and it may be that the Disney version with which we are all familiar is, in fact a re-imagining). The film is superbly directed; finely scripted, well acted, and is a joy to watch. The special effects are excellent, but are not overused. They are there when needed, and are spectacular, creating a magical world we can all appreciate. However, the thrust of the film is the changing relationships between the main characters, which are sometimes surprising and key to the story. Preconceptions from the accepted version of this story are overturned, and the altered relationships between the core characters provide a satisfying basis for a reappraisal of the whole concept of the story. This is a film that everyone should see, because I believe that almost everyone will enjoy it. I have no hesitation in recommending this to all viewers, of all ages.

The Good: 1. Angelina- she was great. 2. Elle fanning was a very cute Aurora. 3. Sam Riley was great as Diaval. 4. Brenton Thwaites as the young Prince Philip. SORRY FEMINISTS, BUT ROMANTIC LOVE IS THERE AND THE AURORA/PHILIP RELATIONSHIP IS TREATED LIKE TWO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS ASKING OUT THE PERSON THEY HAVE A CRUSH ON FOR THE FIRST TIME! 

The BAD: 

Oh my goodness, the people's motivation for trying to kill Maleficent and raid the Moor land is not convincing. Why was treasure so important to them that they did not care for anything else? Why did Stefan value being king over Maleficent? He has to be the worst Disney villain ever! Sometimes, you are made to think that he wasn't an all out evil bad guy, but the script writers seem to ignore that. 

Another thing. I think this movie would have been better if Maleficent had been a dark sort of character at the beginning rather than a sweet little girl. Someone who was redeemable but still had the potential to be the "mistress of ALL EVIL!!!!!" we all knew from the first film. 

Can Once Upon a Time cast Angelina as Maleficent and do a better job at writing her backstory???? Please, it was bad writing until the christening scene that hurt the film. After that, the movie got good.

P.S. Where was King Hubert?????

The closing credit's lazy version of the classic "Once Upon a Dream" theme-song actually echoed how I felt after leaving this movie: drained and disappointed. 

If the movie is billed as a prequel of sorts to the original or at least Maleficent's version of the story, there are too many plot-holes and disappointments.

I'l start though, with its few redemptions:

1.) It's nice to see a maternal relationship between Maleficent and Aurora, but it makes no sense compared to the original storyline.

2.) The few minutes of screen time we have for the 3 fairy godmothers are enjoyable.

3.) The relationship between Maleficent and her raven-like servant is entertaining at times.

4.) It's nice to see that Prince Philip (as poorly as he is casted) doesn't just get to have the princess at the end of the story. Again, though, this makes no sense compared to the original.

Now the bad...

1.) The backstory of how Maleficent becomes evil and vengeful before Aurora's coronation misleads the audience into thinking that the Aurora part of the story will have some kind of connected flow to the original. It clearly doesn't.

a.) In the original, a major conflict is Maleficent's inability to locate Aurora's sanctuary in the forest. In this adaptation, Maleficent finds her right away. So much for the 16th-birthday suspense in the original.

b.) King Stephan quickly but very inexplicably devolves from a father to a tyrant in the new movie. If his long-lost daughter returns to him after 16 years of exile, wouldn't he be a little happier to see her and not just lock her away (a la Rapunzel) in a castle room?

c.) The forest-meeting between Prince Phillip and Aurora makes much more sense in the original. He was at her coronation and knows "once upon a dream" that they will be together. In this newer adaption, he just finds her by "getting lost" in the forest. 

How can he do that when Maleficinet has placed an "impenetrable" thornbush-wall around the entire Moorsland which even the king's best guards can't enter?

d.) Maleficent's magic can put anyone to sleep on a moment's notice. Why, then, when she is freed from the iron net in the castle-battle does she not place a quick spell upon the king and guards once she arises (by replaced wings) to escape them more easily?

e.) She also has a perfect opportunity to create her goblin-like guards (from the original) from the soldiers who try to burn down her thornbush-wall, but that would then, of course, require her to actually use them to help her find Aurora as in the original. These guards work well on a comic-relief level in the original, but no need for them here?

2.) Teenage Aurora arguably looks and sings much more like an adult in the original, but the new casting choice for Aurora looks and sounds much more juvenile than that. If the "Once Upon a Dream" song and dance is such an iconic part of the original, Disney really misses that opportunity by poor casting here. The girl doesn't sing nor dance.

3.) Again, very minimal screen time is given to the 3 fairy godmothers. If they are the protectors of Aurora in the original and are the most entertaining ones in the story (remember the pink/ blue battles?), why on earth do they get such little inclusion here? It just becomes a dramatic convenience for Aurora to feel closer to Maleficent as her "actual" fairy godmother, I guess. Cute idea, but too far from the original.

4.) I should leave a Disney movie (or at least a Disney adaptation) feeling nostalgic for and still connected to the original-- not disappointed that the adaptation is so far removed from the original storyline. 

Maybe the filmmakers are hoping for an audience who hasn't seen the original Sleeping Beauty and who will therefore be too naive to notice the difference. However, they could have done a much better job with the storyline's logic, the casting choices, and the overall connectedness to make the audience feel that investing in or looking back at the original would be a happy and fun thing to do-- not a personal mission to prove to themselves why you still can't beat the original.
