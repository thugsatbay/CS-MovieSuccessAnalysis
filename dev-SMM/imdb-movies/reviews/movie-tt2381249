### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and well worth the price of admission.

Tom Cruise really gets it when it comes to entertaining your average moviegoer and he doesn't disappoint. But the truth is, no one disappoints in this summer flick. All parties brought their 'A' game and played their part perfectly. The female lead (Rebecca Ferguson) really held her own alongside Ethan Hunt and the crew and hopefully we'll see her in future installments, if there is more. Based on this current installment, there should definitely be more.

MI:1 is a classic in my eyes and I've watched it countless times, but I must say, Rogue Nation...well, it's a lot more fun and I do feel it is a better film overall. I will be watching this one again and again. And don't wait for it to come to video...this is a movie you must see in theaters for the full experience.

Also, let me just say the stunt sequences are thrilling...thrilling I say!! Very limited CGI in this film, which made the action scenes even more exciting and dare I say it again...thrilling! Lots of gasp worthy moments.

I won't give away any spoilers as that would ruin the exciting action sequences and fun twists. This is enjoyable from beginning to end. So just go see it!!!

Having seen the previous four 'Mission Impossible' films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable

So, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I've been hearing. However, it wouldn't have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest 'Bourne' or James Bond film (very high)  'MI:5' blew everything I'd expected from it and then some! 

Where to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic  moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances  all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn't nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments.

The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they're kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie's direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced  so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement.

People who weren't fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it's been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn't. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times.

'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I've had the pleasure of experiencing this year. It completely took me by surprise with how well-done it was, and should just about take anyone else to the same conclusion.

You would think that after five films this would have become a tired premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster makes it even better than the new James Bond films. 

It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes it so brilliant.

Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action. Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film.

Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever).

On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.

Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.

There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.

Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. 

From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!

Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent. Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by everyone!

I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's certainly worth the ticked price.

I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format.

"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" is one of the best action films I have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography is amazing and the music is fantastic.

Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase sequences are as exciting as any I have seen.

We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters. Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense.

The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes to the writers who created the character.

In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and deserves a "10" for its place in the genre.

This is the Mission Impossible format: Intro. Tom Cruise in the middle of a mission in some far away country fighting bad guys while doing unbelievable physical feats. 2. Tom Cruise receives a new mission he always accepts, 3. He then gets attacked by bad guys or framed by the organization who wants to destroy the world, 4. He meets hot interracial girl who always tries to kill him but he ends falling in love for her, 5. He sets up a team to find out the bad guy and usually to get what bad guy needs, 6. He trespasses some impossible place were humans cannot access and finds a way to get what the bad guy wants. 6. He finds bad guy with what he needs and never gives it to him and gets tortured in exchange(he can also get tortured at the beginning mission too). 7. He beats bad guy. 8. Team is happy and end of story.

Facts Tom Cruise never dies and never gets badly injured. He always disables self destructing devices at the last millisecond. He is a genius who can crack any code, memorize anything and figure out any puzzle. He never rides motorcycles with a helmet. At least once in every MI movie he disguises as the bad guy or semi-bad guy.

TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around).

**spoiler-free**

Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support, against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible (no pun intended). 

What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of what is going to happen.

Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a good audio setup. 

The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which are not as black and white, making for some interesting development.

Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep the audience hooked until the end. A solid addition to the franchise that keeps one-upping itself on every new release.

Even two hours won't be enough for "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'" to be able to unravel all its exhilaratingly high-octane action and drama. This fifth installment in the franchise surges with death-defying action proceedings, riveting and pulsing with the relentlessness and explosiveness of its spiking adrenaline, to deliver the franchise's most thrilling outing, yet.

That relentlessness is true and screaming right at the opening sequence of the film, where IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is seen dangling from the door of an airbus, already adrift in the air as it ascends even further to the skies. That's the first of too many, and you wouldn't care less of the logic behind such impossible knockout stunt demonstrations, because once the momentum crashes past the speedometer's limit, there's no other choice left but to get consumed by the electrifying influx of near-impossible action setpieces. This doesn't mean there's barely any sense to take in, in fact you would be awed to realize that in spite of its speed and strength-defying physicalities, characterizations are still working along the explosive chaos, and the behavior of the characters, and the emotional aspect of the narrative, still follows acceptable reasoning.

The whole of 'Rogue Nation' can be seen as Hunt's team desperate attempt to keep IMF running, and save it, and the world it intends to protect, from extinction. This time, the major figure of terror, is the mysterious organization, 'The Syndicate', headed by the despicably steel-fisted Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) . Ethan is joined by co-IMF agent, William Brandt (Jeremmy Renner), and suspicious British agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The comic effort comes mostly from Hunt's sidekick, Benji (Simon Pegg), and Brandt, who spends most of the time running and chasing after the shadow-terrorist group, The Syndicate.

Much of the movie's strength emanates from its seemingly unstoppable delivery of edge-of-your-seat action, but you can't ignore the grandeur of its camera shots and the palatable efforts of its lead characters and supports. There's much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high-tension action extravaganza.

One can inevitably notice how Cruise has aged through the franchise's almost two-decade history. He's more tired-looking here, but you can't question his commitment to the franchise. In 'Rogue Nation', he's definitely back, running after, and wrestling against, the equally desperate claws of 'The Syndicate'. He hops across the world to trump the enemy, and in every city, he inevitably gets himself involved in deadly strangulations. At such moments, cinematography is top notch, and the breathtaking panorama becomes an exquisite backdrop for the ever-imminent rumbles. This is where this installment is strongest and most engaging, a strength that should warrant a sixth outing.

Almost a masterpiece.

It contains everything you love about the movies. Suspense, mystery, drama, intelligent action & plot.

I did not expect the experience I got. A start to finish thrill ride which also contained intelligent characters & plot. Christopher McQuarrie has crafted a superb movie which moves at a fast pace but also slows down when it has to for some intelligent character interaction.

Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances & is in almost the entire movie. The rest of the cast are all great. Rebecca Ferguson is a strong character & female equivalent of Ethan Hunt.

Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner & Alec Baldwin all give great performances & have about the same screen time.

The villains lead by Sean Harris are effective & chilling & also a little mysterious.

Music is superb with many subtle bursts of the MI theme. The film does not contain hardly any CGI its nearly all practical real stunt FX.

Overall it just works from start to finish & Christopher McQuarrie has created a superb film experience which does not fail to entertain & deserves repeat viewings to enjoy the experience again & again.

This mission should you chose to accept it is to enjoy the movie & watch it at least once more at the cinema the way its intended to be seen on a massive screen with loud sound.

Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about it the second after it happened. 

The first film had a somewhat complicated plot, a few really breathtaking scenes and Tom Cruise young enough to deliver a fresh performance. The second film had a really silly plot, but the no- CGI motorcycle chase scene and Limp Bizkit soundtrack at least created some legacy. The third installment had a forgettable plot, but a really convincing bad guy played by the late Mr. Hoffman. The fourth film was silly enough, but the Burj Khalifa stunts made by Tom Cruise really stood out. This sequel has none of that. It relies purely on CGI and no plot development, it seems like characters jump from place to place without any motive or any explanation. I am aware of the fact that this lazy approach sells tickets these days, but in order to have a mission impossible really be a mission impossible it needs to have a context where it really seems serious and impossible. People who watched the first sequel remember that the Langley heist was introduced to the audience, planning was made and execution was slow, but exciting. This director could not deliver any of that. 

I hope they stop now, I guess in the next sequel they could go into space or make Tom Cruise might fight a tiger in a cage. Even if he does it will be a CGI tiger, or a CGI Tom Cruise. In a CGI cage, with CGI blood.

Big disappointment, really.

I went last night 8/7. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because chase credit card has a buy one get one free movie ticket on Fridays. Why everyone is raving about this bore shows people are paid to write reviews. How can anyone say 10 out of 10. MI 1 was and still is the best one of the franchise. The airplane scene? Big frigging deal why is that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times. 

Save your money unless you get a buy one get one movie pass like I did. My chick and I walked out 1hr and 35 mins in. We couldn't take it anymore. The audience actually laughed a few times during this. Why? There was no comedy in this. A monotone bore. The first hour not 1 action scene after the stupid plane one in the beginning. I went out to a rock concert after that was more entertaining than this drivel. Some others walked out as well. The only good thing was the sour cream and chive popcorn and the fact the theater sells alcohol to numb the pain of this movie. San Andreas was better. On that note I'm off to play Xbox 360. It's more entertaining than this lame flick

This is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't like watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't review just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend time repeating what others may have already said about a given film; until today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I mean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the cinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5 hours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews before going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same film others who reviewed this film as "highly enjoyable". I am beyond puzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who get easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a plot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth. The planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a "film" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I knew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but despite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the theater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind that I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot was not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers shouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the nonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly outstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut-- was hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another outstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue Jasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The other actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its presentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product placements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were indicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say show the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to type in the upper right corner..."Washington D.C.", just to make it look official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case one didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was accompanied by the words "London, England". If you are looking for a similar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue with believable characters, I highly recommend "The International" out a few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and watch paint dry for a more redeeming experience.

Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and interesting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next (sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they made it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely won't be disappointed.

This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients:

1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation.

2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack just didn't quite cut it for me.

Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other in a pretty decent plot.

But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.

After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate but he captured by his agents. However he succeeds to escape with the help of mysterious Syndicate agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane (Sean Harris). A couple of months later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot. Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust? Will Ethan be capable to prove that the Syndicate does exist? 

"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is a highly entertaining action film. The fast-paced development of the plot does not give time to think and the viewer sees a very enjoyable film. The unknown Rebecca Ferguson has a beautiful face and performs a key character that will be on the next movie of this franchise. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "Missão: Impossível - Nação Secreta" ("Mission: Impossible - Secret Nation")

Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clichéd role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?

I remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed the first thought that ran through my head was "Here we go again" as I released an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission, something goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of MacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert random forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end.

that being said, the film's action scenes are amazing, and really make you question the sanity of Cruise, who needlessly continues to insist on doing all of his stunts. Basically it's another Tom Cruise Hollywood blockbuster, which at the end of the day made me finally realize, "Why was I ever expecting anything else in the first place?"

I officially watched all of these films back to back (yes, I have no life) to get a feel for the overall Mission Impossible story-line. I actually enjoyed this one much more than a few of the other entries in the series.

In terms of action, it's packed right from the get go! The stunts that they used in this film are unbelievable. Of course everyone was talking about the opening scene with the aircraft that was used in the trailer, but it doesn't end there. That's literally just the beginning. So if action is what you want, that's what you'll get. It could have benefited from less CGI in the driving sequences, but they're fun to watch (II and III are much worse by comparison).

The plot line by itself is a bit convoluted, as they were trying to emphasize the spy vs spy story-line that can be expected from every Mission Impossible film. The dialogue is also fairly complex to follow, which makes the storyline even harder to follow. The 'doublespeak' they used was pretty confusing to say the least, which has become the trend in most politically themed films. It doesn't ruin the film, but you don't watch something like this for the story. It kinda feels like they were going for a plot twist moment in every block of dialogue, which just ruins a storyline for me.

And of course there is Tom Cruise. The seminal character that links all of these films together. He does a good job of maintaining the character of Ethan Hunt throughout the series, but in this entry into the series, this his him at his most over-the-top. Tom Cruise did some pretty great action sequences, and it paid off. I won't say anything negative about the actor himself, but I respect his stunt performances, driving ability, and what he brought into this film as an actor. Simon Pegg had some fairly decent dramatic moments, (and he even has a fight sequence!!!). Most of the previous characters from the other Mission films return to bring a sense of unity to the series.

So if you're looking for some pretty amazing action, check it out. If you want an incredible spy film, this isn't it.

Fifth movie in the Mission Impossible franchise has Ethan Hunt & IMF friends trying to stop a mysterious group known as the Syndicate, despite the IMF being shut down by the government and Ethan being wanted by the CIA. Enjoyable actioner but there's not much new here. Tom Cruise continues to prove he's one of the more consistent stars out there as he always seems to put out solid popcorn movies and occasionally something more than that. The supporting cast is good, with Simon Pegg stealing every scene he's in and Rebecca Ferguson as the attractive assassin who saves Tom throughout the movie. Is she good or is she bad? Will you care? Ving Rhames gets little to do. Sean Harris plays the forgettable villain. Alec Baldwin is the red herring who, along with Jeremy Renner, seems almost unnecessary in making this work. The action is solid and the humor (mostly from Pegg) is appreciated. I have to say that this is not my favorite Mission Impossible movie or even top three. There's something nondescript about it all, similar to the last film. At least the first three each had something about them that was memorable. Now it seems the series is satisfied just putting out a solid action thriller with more focus on stunts than characters, plot, or even style. Watchable for fans but really nothing special.

Ho hum; seen it all before. I don't understand why people seem so enamoured by this. It's like a made for TV James Bond on a bad day. Ethan Hunt isn't interesting. IMF isn't interesting. The first half was okay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too many locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really about anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to find a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it really wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise pollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I don't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about. Watch James Bond instead. Mission mediocrity.

Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, is back at it again. This movie was interesting, but not quite satisfying.

The timeline of the movie was disappointing. The opening scene should not have been the biggest stunt scene of the movie. That had set extremely high expectations for what was going to follow. But the remainder stunts and scenes of the movie were not anything that spectacular.

There was one scene that was catchy in a way. The car chase did not have any music playing as it was happening. This I actually enjoyed because it drew more attention to the details of the car chase. If music was played in with it, it more than likely would have made it more or less dramatic than what it actually was.

Although the movie did not live up to what it had been portrayed as, it is still a good addition to the Mission Impossible series. Maybe next time, they do not open with the biggest scene of the movie.

I am not going to review the whole movie. Just complain about the childish attempt at humor in the early part. Either have the Shaun of the Dead play serious or replace him.

The very early stunts were just silly, after that they were over the top, but that is fine for this genre. Hanging from the plane climbing, while the guy tries to fumble with the correct process to open the door. Not intense, it is boring.

My other complaint is the idea of agents marked for death being captured over and over always struck me as pathetic. I hated back in the Donald Hamilton Matt Helm books and never liked.

I am not saying the movie is not worth seeing, just that with a little less slap stick, it would have been better.

The Mission Impossible series has only gotten bigger since its inception on to the big screen 20 years ago opening with Brian De Palmas smaller scale slick and intense thriller where we are introduced to Tom Cruise's secret agent Ethan Hunt. John Woo then steps up the action with MI2 Slow-mo shots galore and full of the directors trademarks which work ever so well in Hard Boiled but fail Massively and is a miss-step in the franchise. JJ Abrahams directs the darkest in the series to date , portraying a more vulnerable Ethan Hunt and for my money has the best villain of the series in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. 2011s Ghost Protocol yet again ramps up the action to good effect with some of the best action set pieces of the series bringing on board Brad Bird in the hot seat and seemed to revitalize the flailing franchise.

Rogue Nation is the fifth installment. The IMF has been disbanded and Ethan Hunt is now an outlaw for the C.I.A. The team have their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the syndicate - A rogue organization helmed by Lane (Sean Harris) committed to destroying the IMF.

Full of blistering well done fast paced action as to be expected but I don't think it has moved the franchise any further, now more than ever in the Tom Cruise show has become a series of massive action sequences that could be shown in any order and it wouldn't make a difference. Nothing quite matches the stunt on the Burj Khalifa, here it seems to be a nuts and bolt affair which makes it mostly tension free which is a disappointment.

Christopher McQaurrie does a fine job in the directors chair but the screenplay is so-so. McQaurrie seems to be able to direct over the top action with his eyes shut one of the best in the business in this genre (The Way of the Gun is an underrated classic in action cinema). Which is why it's hard to take that MI:5 is lacklustre in almost every other aspect with the exception of a couple of great action sequences.

Same old, same old for the crew here Cruise the unstoppable machine with some spectacular and daring stunts which he indulges in more than ever, Simon Pegg's Benji the comic relief which for me grated at times, The ever tough and stolid Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Ving Rhame's Luther cool as a cucumber as always. A new face in Rebecca Ferguson for my money (Acting wise at least) is the star she absolutely convinces in her role and you as the viewer are never quite sure what sides she is really on.

There is certainly a lot of value in here for action heads it just seems for me at least to be getting somewhat stale don't get me wrong I do like it as it is one of the better franchises out there. It's the same old and that's all good if that's what you are after get some more suspending wires and tapping on laptops mid-air. Worth checking out but for me was a slight disappointment . It adds nothing new for the audience maybe it does for Cruise personally film by film outdoing himself stunt wise. As a spectacle it's decent but not the best in the series.

I went into this movie with some expectations. Having not seen any of the others, but hearing very good things about this one, I was curious as to what to expect. I'm happy to say that it was fairly impressive. 

The plot of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is one that clearly has been being developed in the previous movies. However, it wasn't hard to understand the plot, despite not seeing the previous four movies. It feel like a continuation but it's still capable of standing on its own. For the most part the plot is done quite well, but I felt like a lot of it was implied more than it was actually explained. Maybe I should have seen the previous movies to understand, but I've had this same problem with a lot of other spy movies. 

The characters aren't anything special. Very averagely developed. 

The movie as a whole is very average. The sequence of events is one we've all seen before, so you never feel particularly tense because the end result is fairly obvious. However, the movie is paced very well, and the formula itself is overshadowed by how well done the movie is. The fights are great, the spy technology is cool. There is a lot of greatness in this movie, so it's very easy to overlook the formulaic sequence of events. 

Overall Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a very well done spy movie. While I think some plot points should have been explained a bit better, it's done very well. I'll certainly be seeing this again, and who knows? Maybe I'll increase my rating. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone, especially people who like spy movies like this.
