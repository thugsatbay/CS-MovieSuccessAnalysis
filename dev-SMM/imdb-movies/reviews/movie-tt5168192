Ken Loach does it again.

If you know Ken Loach (and importantly his writing partner Paul Laverty) you'll know I, Daniel Blake.

It's a nightmare. 

A total nightmare. 

Life on poverty line Britain that is. 

And Loach hammers this home with gusto. 

He chooses Newcastle as his latest political landscape, partly because "it's grim up North" but also because, in my experience, Geordies are the salt of the earth; kind, lovable folks. And this is the main emotional driver of this nightmare. 

Daniel Blake is caught in a trap. 

A bureaucratic hell populated by "computer says no" mini Hitlers occupying mainly minor roles in the Jobseeker hell that is Tory Britain. In a bid to out 'scroungers' the system has eaten itself and is spitting out vulnerable pitiful fodder like Daniel (played deeply sympathetically by comedian Dave Johns. He'll never win an Oscar but this part was made for him) and the lovable but deeply vulnerable Katie (played equally well by Hayley Squires - Call the Midwife).

He's had a heart attack and his doctors say he can't work but the Benefits Police say he has to go on jobseeker allowance and look for work or lose all entitlement to any money AT ALL.

It's farcical.

She's moved from a women's hostel in London because she can't afford a flat in London with her two children (one slightly miscast as a rather posh daughter, Daisy). She's having the same problems, only hers start from a tinpot Hitler chucking her out of the Job Centre for being late for her appointment.

They bond. He helps her. She helps him. It's grim but deeply affecting. We then follow their shared struggle.

In many ways this movie is like a Ken Loach Primer. It has all his usual trademarks and the 'working class people are good' message is laid on way too thickly.

But.

And it's a big but they are in a profoundly believable real-life drama and I found myself in tears (of collective shame?) three times during it.

It certainly makes the reality of food banks in Britain very, very meaningful. I won't pass a collection point again if my conscience holds up.

Everything that is good about Loach is in this film. In parts it's laugh out loud funny (but it's laughs of derision at our State). In parts it's deeply moving, even though some of the plot is verging on the ridiculous.

But who cares. Ken Loach holds a mirror up to our frankly DISGUSTING society and mocks it.

But he mocks it with the most vicious of venom. 

It feels real. Really real.

It's a must see.

This movie caught me by my heart, like every other piece by Laverty- Loach cooperation. It is not a thriller, there are no twists, no peaks of emotions. It shows the naked reality of our everyday lives with its great pains and humor at the same time. But, the "banality" of these great pains is the strength of the movie, it shows how every encounter with the system is the time we face the reality of the system and look for someone who will give a hand us to survive it. Of course, this is mostly valid for the working class. The film softly depicts that it is not a socialist propaganda, because when truly shown the reality itself unveils as a socialist propaganda. 

But the film is not another documentaristic presentation of the everyday life of a worker, as it also shows how to cope with all these we experience. It is the formation of a solidarity with others like us, the woman in the queue, the Chinese in the factory, the black in the warehouse, the clerk at the office... We are already connected, even with those in other continents. Once we see someone shouting with his writing on the wall, we should shout with him with our voice. If one of them writes a letter, another should spread its word.

A shot in the head of the Britain's social security system, a great call for solidarity.

I left the cinema with a lot to think about after viewing this film. A gritty and realistic drama portraying the processes and outcomes of claimants caught up in today's benefit system, sometimes with dreadful outcomes.

Every public servant, politician and voluntary sector worker should be expected to watch this film. A lot of it is not easy viewing, and certainly not suitable for a fun night out, but the message it gives about today's society is compelling.

I think a message should be included on-screen but before the credits suggesting people contact the Citizens' Advice Bureau if they are experiencing any of the issues raised in the film.

This film is hard hitting and heart wrenching, tears through and came out crying. 

A try to replicate how the authorities are treating the venerable in the face of devastation. It is heart wrenching. It might have been based what has happened to a few in the recent past. I think Paul Laverty took a leaf out of the records and wrote the strip and Ken Loach put it on screen in the best possible way.

Agree with other reviewer A must see film by not just the general public but the Authorities to waken them up and hit them hard.

At the end at least in our screening there were applause of appreciation to Ken to show how well he has done to make this look so real.

After Ken Loach's latest film "I, Daniel Blake" (2016) took home the most prestigious film award of the year, Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this summer, there has been a lot of discussion or at least anticipation of discussion on the film. The Guardian, for one, published a long article where people from all walks of life shared their differing opinions on the film. As a fierce story of social relevance, telling about an ailing carpenter whose life goes to pieces in the vast sea of bureaucracy, "I, Daniel Blake" is bound to be criticized for being didactic and demagogic as it hits the commercial screens. Some will fall in love with the film for its honest authenticity, while others will be put off by its unapologetic directness. 

The film begins with the title character, Daniel Blake going through an assessment in the unemployment office after his doctor has deemed him unfit for work due to a heart condition. Unfortunately, Daniel ends up in a paradoxical position, the likes which Kafka could have devised, where he is not concerned unhealthy enough to apply for sickness benefit and has to therefore apply for job seeker's allowance, coercing him into a pointless cycle of searching for jobs he cannot really take. In the middle of this absurd jungle of gray offices and red tapes, Daniel befriends Katie, a single mother of two in a similar situation. Daniel's cardinal sin in the bureaucratic world is his refusal to play by its rules, to fake and to pull the strings where needed. 

Loach is known for his simplicity in both style and narrative without ever coming close to minimalism. His simplicity is of a different kind, a simplicity of the heart on the level of the subject matter which is often social by nature. This simplicity gives room for the unfolding of story and character in their natural state which is of the utmost importance for Loach's intentions. At times warm and funny, at others raw and brutal, the story of "I, Daniel Blake" is hard to be dismissed for its authenticity. It will likely speak to most people as do the great realist novels of the 19th century. It is a simple voice with real thought and emotion behind it, saying something of relevance, straight out and loud. While the title of the film might pave way for quasi-libertarian interpretations of Loach's critique of the social benefits system, his intentions could not be clearer to those who have seen the film. The titular character is merely someone to carry the torch of solidarity; to Loach and others, he represents a mass of millions. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film "intervenes in the messy, ugly world of poverty with the secular intention of making us see that it really is happening, and in a prosperous nation." This is the simplicity which gives Loach's cinema its moral aura.

Although many may feel put off by the film's direct social message and strong moral pathos, which can feel didactic or even demagogic at times, and it will not find its dearest fan in yours truly either, I think the film deserves acclaim for its integrity. The film does not hide its rhetoric or its message. After all, its "leftist agitation" may not be stranger than the ideology of upper middle class family life propagated by contemporary popular culture. The way I see it, "I, Daniel Blake" is more a personal expression of worry and concern rather than manufactured propaganda with an impersonal agenda. At worst the film might be preachy or sentimental, but at best it is the most authentic thing Ken Loach has done since "My Name Is Joe" (1998), a parallel work in the truest sense of the word. To put it bluntly, I am glad that "Jimmy's Hall" (2014) did not end up being the legacy Loach left for cinema; but "I, Daniel Blake" could very well be just that.

A heartwrenching look at the British benefits system which presents a real juxtaposition to the ubiquitous 'Benefits Street', 'Daily Mail 'scroungers' headlines-type culture that we've become so accustomed to.

'I, Daniel Blake' follows the lives of Daniel and Katie who, although from very different backgrounds both appear to be suffering similar fates at the hands of The State.

With believable, real characters, excellent acting and an engaging plot, the film really draws you in, and leaves you feeling grateful for what you have. Yes it clearly has a political message and no it won't be for everyone but it certainly can't be knocked. Better and more important than many of the so called 'blockbusters' we'll see this year.

I have just watched this film and felt I had to add my voice to others who have rated it.

Ken Loach has nailed it again.

While many came in to see it with the usual cinema food that can be a noisy distraction as the film progressed you could have heard a pin drop.

As the credits started to roll I started to applaud, others joined in. I have never been to see a film where I felt this was necessary.

Sadly the film showed how dysfunctional the systems meant to support are failing.

This film should mandatory for all in authority and all M.P.s and members of the House of Lords to view.

If film is a mirror on society then the sheer volume of recent movies  about the ugliness of the post- GFC world is a reflection of the scale  of devastation it has caused. Most are essays in poverty that explore  the loss of humanity for ordinary people. The film I, Daniel Blake  (2016) is another in this genre. It is an intense portrait of an  ordinary man who struggles to retain dignity in an Orwellian world. Far  from entertaining, it is gritty, raw, and unrelenting. 
Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a rough-speaking but likable 59-year-old  tradesman in Newcastle, England. He is recovering from a serious heart  attack and lives alone. Unable to work, he does what thousands like him  do in such circumstances: he applies for support allowance so he can  pay his bills until health returns. What happens next is not the point,  rather it is how it happens that will make you cringe. Form-filling  becomes an obstacle course for preventing people like Daniel from  getting help and the staff who process him absolve themselves of  responsibility through constant referral to the "decision-maker" who is  never there. Denied support allowance, he must apply for a job-seeker  benefit that requires 35 hours a week of documented job hunting. His  protestations are officially sanctioned and he loses all support. 
In the midst of his own inhuman treatment by a soul-less bureaucracy  Daniel tries to help a single mother with two young children who is  also crushed by the system. Katie (Hayley Squires) has moved from a  homeless hostel and is living on food handouts because her benefits  have been stopped. She finds 'affordable accommodation' that Daniel  offers to repair and he becomes a father figure. Still unable to buy  shoes for her children, Katie finds the kind of work that shocks Daniel  but is the last resort for many abandoned by a social welfare system  with gaping holes in its safety net. Desperate to help her, Daniel  vents his frustration through graffiti on the welfare office wall and  briefly becomes an urban hero. 
This is a disturbing film that many audiences will find confronting,  particularly those who think they live in a caring society that  supports people in need. The pace is slow and the dialogue often terse,  but that's how life is at the bottom. The subdued cinematography and  colour palette accentuates the drabness of life for the dispossessed.  Perfectly cast, the two main actors fill their roles with an authentic  voice for countless ordinary people who fall on hard times. There is no  joy in this film and whatever humour you find is there to make the  story bearable. But in a world that moves inexorably towards a  hard-right social conscience, it is a film that cries out to be seen  and heard.

Ken Loach is a name I always recognise but then struggle to remember any of his work. I think, "ah good, it's by Ken Loach" and then "what's he done again? Oh Kes!" But Kes was 47 years ago and shamefully, I'm not familiar with any of his films since then. One conclusion from this realisation is that Loach has a strong reputation as a filmmaker and this was my long awaited reunion. 

We follow Daniel Blake, a middle-aged carpenter who's taken a few recent knocks, one of which is suffering a heart-attack and deemed not able to return to work. It's a position no one would want to be in, forced to sacrifice your own health or lose everything you have worked so hard for. 

We witness the hurdles that seem purposely put there to hinder payments, speaking from personal experience I can relate to this situation to a degree. How are people such as Daniel Blake suppose to survive, or better still, have a good life they are suppose to be able to live. 

It's a harsh reality on how parts of the British system fails it's people and proof that there's no real incentive to do things by the book. Having been in a similar situation myself, skirting the unemployment line getting advise from people who have no ambitious or understanding of what I wanted to do. 

Taking this on a more personal level, I quit a stressful position last year in the hopes of pursuing my own dream of being an artist and writer. Having to sign agreement that I would spend a number of hours trying to find work and having to provide evidence of doing so each fortnight would grant me the universal credit that I never actually received. I actually had a good case worker, as everyplace of work has good people, but equally there are those that can't see beyond, much like what is portrayed in this story. Though, instead of supporting me in trying to be something I both enjoy and apparently good at, they attempted to find me similar stressful jobs that I left for my own sanity, wanting to place me back amongst the wolves. 

Dave Johns is exceptional as Daniel Blake, emitting the boiling frustrations of the soul- destroying turn of events, right to the very end. Hayley Squires' Katie is short of brilliant too, displaying the tremendous pressure when faced with these kind of tribulations. Though, the acting from the rest of the supporting cast is less desirable, it's forgivable. 

It's a raw, honest and emotional look at the suffering and poor way of life some unfortunate people have to contend with in Great Britain. It's compelling, invoking and upsetting, showing the great lengths and risks people go through in order to maintain their self dignity. It's certainly a film that boasts Loach's credibility.

An accurate depiction of the benefit system is portrayed in this heartbreaking film. For anyone that has been in Daniels predicament, being out of work after a long length of employment, will feel empathy with his position. If you have not had to endure the ridiculousness that is the Welfare system in Britain, prepare to see a typical string of scenarios that makes up the bulk of the film, will wind you up like a tightly coiled spring and send you to the same place, mentally, as Daniel. I predicted the ending and because of his medical condition this wasn't too much of a surprise. This is the only film in a long time that has made me cry. Not at the predictable ending but at the memories that resonated with me about our benefits system and how it degrades you and takes away any dignity or pride that you may have left after being made unemployed.

After seeing "I, Daniel Blake" there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Ken Loach isn't just the best director to have come out of Britain in the last 50 years but one of only a small handful of great directors still working today. Of course, his films are not merely 'entertainments'; he is the most unashamedly political director there is and "I, Daniel Blake" is his most unashamedly political film, certainly since "Cathy Come Home". It is also possibly his best.

Once again the writer is Paul Laverty who was worked with Loach numerous times in the past, (theirs is the among the greatest of all cinematic partnerships), and his superb script cuts to the bone. As someone who has sat on both sides of a Benefits Office counter I can honestly say that no-one strikes a false note here. Loach is famous for working with non-professionals or largely unknown actors, (Carol White, a fresh face when she made "Cathy Come Home", David Bradley in "Kes", Crissy Rock in "Ladybird Ladybird"), and "I, Daniel Blake" is no different.

The title character is played by stand-up comic Dave Johns and the young, single mother he befriends is Haley Squires. Add in an extraordinary cast of British character players and you have a film that oozes a documentary-like realism from every pore. Of course, at times it is virtually unwatchable. This is a film about victims and the appalling bureaucracy that sees them slip through the net. You could say it is a film about the failure of the Welfare State. Unlike "Cathy Come Home" however, I can't see it touching the hearts and minds of our present Tory Government which surely is shameful. Brexit, we have been told, is about taking back control but control of what; an appallingly defunct system where to care or show feeling is almost a sackable offence? The film was rightly applauded at the screening I attended and is the best I have seen this year.

This is an excellent movie. Brilliantly written and directed, this is a no holds barred look at the British benefits system and how it dehumanises people who need State funded help.

The two lead characters have gripping back stories. Daniel and Kate help each other come to terms with how the State sees them as nothing but a number and an unwanted burden.

The movie is gritty, heart breaking and funny in parts. It is a social commentary that Ken Loach is so good at, showing what a great filmmaker he is. This is not a feel good movie but it is a rewarding and thought provoking watch.

A decade after his "The wind that shakes the barley", Ken Loach collected his second Palme d'Or award with "I, Daniel Blake". The general entertainment-seeking audience (who are used to rain-of-bullets, jaw-cracking-punches and explosion every three minutes), if they are ever enticed for whatever insane reason to buy a ticket to see this movie, may have a common question: who is the villain? An answer is actually provided near the end of the movie: the state. This movie is a bitter accusation against the heartless bureaucratic system.

The titular protagonist is 59, recently widowed, a carpenter by profession. His vicissitudes are only just beginning. While not noticeable on the surface, he is a patient recovering from heart attack. With the British social security system as a safety net, you would have thought that Blake is spared the agony of being driven to abject poverty, and even the threat of starvation looming in the not-too-distant future. Unfortunately, while there are several social security systems that might help him, he hits one road block after another, banging his head against the rigidity innate in these systems and officials that appear to relate more closely to robots than human beings. As the future looks bleak (he is selling one possession after another to stave off going to food banks that will rob him of his last scrap of dignity), a ray of hope appears. There is a good very chance that he can win an appeal against one of the "sanctions" that blocks relief money to which he is entitled. But, trying to freshen himself up in the washroom before the hearing, he dies of a sudden heart attack.

A subplot running parallel with Blake's fight against the bureaucracy is his friendship with a young woman, entirely Platonic. Katie has two young children, a girl and a boy, from two failed liaisons (not sure if they were marriages). Without a professional skill as Blake's (albeit working-class skill), she is financially even worse off, to the extent of going hungry because the provision from the food back is only enough to feed the children. Motivated by sympathy for a kindred human spirit, he becomes sort of a surrogate father figure of the family. Meanwhile Katie, with the meaning of "dignity" taking up more of a monetary bias, resorts to prostitution. When Blake discovers this, the relationship between them understandably suffers. When it is eventually mended, he is close to his last days.

Before watching the movie, upon learning that a stand-up comedian has been cast for the title role, I was a little surprised as most people would be. I am now fully convinced that Dave Johns is an excellent choice. If the posters have you believe that Blake is simply a manifestation of anger, it is misleading, intentional or not. The underdog that Johns portrays is indeed frustrated sometimes even exasperated. But he is patient, sometimes almost to the extent of stoic resignation. That is what makes him so endearing to the audience, plus of course his kindness to Katie and her children.

"I, Daniel Blake" stays well clear of sentimentality and is only a tad melodramatic at one or two places (such as the discovery of Katie getting into prostitution and the Blake's final death). Nor is this movie judgmental on a personal sense. An array of people paraded on the screen are depicted realistically. For example, when Katie is caught at shoplifting, the tough looking security in-charge turns out to be surprisingly humane and lenient, while the mild-looking store clerk has ultra-motives in the kindness he shows her. Likewise, the good and the bad equally populate the individuals Blake runs into, with none of them depicts with any exaggeration.

Dave Johns is a lovingly understated Daniel Blake that will have you weeping silent tears rather that breaking down in an emotional outburst. Hayley Squires, portraying Katie in stubbornly self-contained agony and muted defiance, matches Johns scene for scene in excellence. Briana Shann as the little daughter Daisy shines.

Anyone who may be under the impression that Britain's great social realist Ken Loach has lost the sense of social injustice that has defined his magnificent track record since his milestone BBC television play Cathy Come Home (1966), may be rest assured that there is a still plenty of fire in the prolific English director's belly. In what feels like an angry reaction to the Tories' austerity measures and the tabloid cries of 'Benefits Britain', I, Daniel Blake feels like a war cry to unite the skilled, working-class grafters who continue to be chewed up by a bureaucratic system that is leaving the elderly and those truly in need behind, forcing them to demean themselves for the assistance and care they truly deserve.

In Newcastle, Daniel Blake (played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns) is informed by his GP that he has a heart condition that will keep him out of work for the foreseeable future. Apprehensively, but on his doctor's recommendation, he heads to the Job Centre to sign on. He is eager to get back to work, but is confident that a lifetime of hard manual labour and steady work has surely earned him the right to seek aid in his time of need. He is denied employment and support benefits, despite his GP's note, and is systematically passed from one department to another, each of which require him to fill in a form online (he's so clueless with computers that he runs the mouse up the side of the monitor at one point) and provide evidence that he is actively seeking employment, despite his inability to work. So begins a ludicrous, Kafka-esque battle against a system seemingly eager to make the process as difficult as possible.

It's an incredibly depressing subject matter, and a topic which tends to lead to extreme reactions, depending on who you speak to and whose opinion they've recently read and decided they agree with. Yet this is certainly not a depressing film, it's actually incredibly funny. There's a real warmth to the script by Paul Laverty, and a real tenderness to the relationship between Daniel and single mother Katie (Hayley Squires); a Londoner who has been moved up North to the next available residence, itself a damning indictment of the soaring house prices in the capital and the government's eagerness to upscale 'urban' neighbourhoods. Struggling to find a job and faced with the same bureaucratic barriers as Daniel, she starves herself so her children can eat hot food, and is caught shoplifting. Perhaps you've shaken your head at the single mother on the bus struggling to control her screaming children, but Loach shows us what life might really be like for those truly in need.

In a truly Loachian touch, there's also much joy to be had in the company of working class. Daniel forms a friendship with his young neighbour China (Kema Sikazwe), a cheeky chap who is selling authentic trainers at a cut-price by shrewdly importing them directly from the warehouse (the scene in which Daniel meets his Chinese contact via Skype is one of the film's most hilarious moments). Despite the serious subject matter and occasional heart- breaking moment, there's a weird sense of optimism to the film's sense of injustice. Like a rallying cry to anyone left behind by the system, a triumphant and incredibly satisfying scene of defiance, from which the film gets its title, occurs towards the end of the film. As one would expect, Loach downplays it, ensuring that his message is properly received with a sobering climax. There's talk of Ken Loach going into retirement, and if this proves to be his final film, he's gone out with a bang, delivering from one of the finest movies of his career.

I went with a friend to a special preview screening of the movie. Pre to the screening, one of the movie's production team spoke to the audience to explain how this was a very important movie, that required word of mouth to ensure it was seen by the masses. 

This is an unashamedly political movie by Ken Loach. But no surprises there. It's a tough movie. Its a movie that makes you angry and sad and frustrated. Is it, however, an accurate movie? Is it as important as Ken Loach wants us all to believe?

Here lies my problem with this film. 

As a piece of storytelling its a strong movie. Its a movie that really shines a light on the misery of being caught in the benefits trap that exists for some people. The characters are great... engaging, lovable, pitiful, nice 'citizens'. If the movie was purely telling a story about these two main characters (and the children) and highlighting how the system is flawed for these two characters only...then it is a success with spades.

But I believe the movie is essentially trying to portray all people caught up in the benefits system as poor unfortunates who are all outstandingly good individuals. There is the issue. 

For every Daniel Blake - there is a Benefits Street candidate. For every Katie there is a Dee. 

I grew up in Tyneside (where this movie is set) on a council estate where the vast majority were 'on the dole'. I witnessed the widespread abuse of the benefits system by people who were as far removed from the characters portrayed in this movie as could be. I therefore found it hard to truly feel the emotional impact that I know others will feel.

Does the movie highlight some of the harsher issues currently being faced by people like Daniel Blake? Yes it does. Is that acceptable? No its not. 

The story of Katie, was for me the stronger. A single Mum doing her absolute best under very difficult circumstances. The food bank scene is terrible to watch, but brilliantly acted. 

The main thrust of the story is Daniel Blake's predicament. Highlighting how a person who has suffered a heart attack, and is unable to work due to medical advice can be rejected Disability Support Allowance by the 'independent' assessment system and then forced into Job Seekers allowance (and the online emphasis thereafter - and proof of looking for work) is extremely well constructed. But Ken Loach wants us to believe this system is 100% flawed for all people. It simply isn't. But when it goes wrong.....the human impact is terrible. That is the story....

I wanted that to be clearer. I wanted the movie not to become Left Wing Socialist propaganda. It ended with Daniel Blake being tagged the 'Citizen' with appropriate badges given out at the end of the movie..... A overt political cry for Left Wing Socialism. But this is Ken Loach after all. 

Sadly, this turned me off, and after spending an evening reflecting, I believe ultimately that will damage the movie for many others too. I completely sympathized with the main characters (you couldn't not), but do not accept that the system is as malicious as it was portrayed. The stereotypes for all Management and Establishment was too much. The convenient way the movie tries to brush off benefit abuse (such as applying for jobs to tick a box to receive benefits - with no intention to work) was too convenient. 

Not all people or citizens out there are as good as Daniel Blake. I am fine to accept the message (and premise) that the system should be flexible enough to adapt to Daniel Blake's (and that should have been the whole message) but do not accept that the system should allow everyone free reign to live on benefits without any forms of control. 

Would I recommend this movie. Absolutely. 

Will I take to the streets afterwards. No.

Daniel Blake (Dave Johns), a 59-year old heart attack victim who is trying to collect welfare in the city of Newcastle, England comes up against a dehumanizing system that seems to be out to thwart him at every step of the process in I, Daniel Blake, British director Ken Loach and his long time scriptwriter Ken Laverty's latest collaboration. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, the film has a social conscience and does not hesitate to pull out all the emotional stops, but is unfortunately undercut by an excessive amount of speech making, contrived situations, and sentimentality. Performed by British stand-up comedian Dave Johns, the film is guaranteed to bring laughter, tears, and also anger at the system's coldhearted bureaucrats who know about rules and regulations but not so much about people's needs.

The film opens with a black screen. Slowly, we begin to hear a man being interviewed by a woman who identifies herself as a health-care professional. Having to answer lame questions about his cognitive abilities and motor skills but nothing about his heart, Dan tells the interviewer, "We're getting further and further away from my heart." He has been told by his doctor that he is not ready to go back to work and has applied for an Employment and Support Allowance, a stipend paid to those unable to work because of a disability. Unfortunately, the government concludes that he is fit for work, forcing him to appeal to the "decision maker" to change the ruling.

Forced to jump through a set of hoops just to earn the right to appeal, Dan must prove that he has spent 35 hours a week looking for work. Applying for Jobseeker's Allowance and not being computer savvy, he has to seek help just to learn how to use a mouse. When he meets Katie (Hayley Squires), a young single mother with two small children (Briana Shann and Dylan Phillip McKiernan) who has just come from London and is in need of assistance, the story becomes about people working together to provide mutual support in dealing with a faceless bureaucracy.

Dan and Katie become friends with Dan offering moral support and using his carpenter skills to make her flat more livable. Katie looks for work as a cleaner, sacrifices food to make sure her children are fed, and is even forced to work briefly as a call girl. One of the most heartbreaking scenes occurs at a visit to the local Food Bank when Katie has a breakdown after opening and eating a can of baked beans, but both are resilient and determined not to let the system crush them.

I, Daniel Blake, without question, comes from a good place and Blake captures our allegiance with his grumpy determination, kindness and concern for others, but there is little room here for nuance, balance, or objectivity. The film exists to make a point and everything else is subordinate to that. Though the performances are first-rate and Johns has perfect comic timing, I, Daniel Blake is not, in my view, one of Loach's better efforts.

I, Daniel Blake is not easy viewing, and nor should it be. For fifty years, director Ken Loach has been making films with a finger on the pulse of modern Britain and here, in the 'twilight' of his career, he provides us with arguably his most provocative, touching and downright important film since the days of 'Kathy Come Home' first peeled back the layers of squalid British life to show the humanity of people let down by a system ignorant and uncaring of the predicaments it has itself caused.

Daniel Blake is a lifelong carpenter, struck down by a serious heart condition and left to navigate the dense and seemingly obtuse benefits system apparently designed to hinder, not help him. Told he is unfit to work by his GP, Daniel is however failed on the all-works test by a 'health professional' and then pushed from pillar to post by a system that demands a sick man looks for work that isn't there, to satisfy benefit conditions he cannot hope to fulfil. The Orwellian system of online applications, claim forms and appeal hearings leaves the close to retirement Daniel perplexed and frustrated in a world of faceless bureaucracy and a digital welfare system that is as alien to him as a monkey wrench would be to a web designer.

Amidst this daily grind to find common sense amongst automated applications and robotic administrators, Daniel meets Katie, a young single mum just arrived from London, and the two strike up a deep friendship based on their shared failure to fit into a world that regards them as clients and customers rather than people. Together they experience the real-life shames of food banks, shop-lifting and prostitution, as Katie skips meals to feed her kids and steals sanitary products when the measly handouts run dry. Ultimately she has little choice but turn to prostitution, trading in the only asset society has left her - her looks - and when Daniel tries to persuade her that selling herself (and her self-respect) is a step too far, their friendship is threatened, leaving Daniel destitute and without even the small amount of hope left in his increasingly perilous life.

Loach's casting and direction makes the most of a superlative cast - as is his signature - and the grim and grimy streets of Newcastle are depicted with a typically documentary feel (it's often unsure whether the extras in the film are aware they are being filmed or not, which in a segment showing Daniel's arrest after he graffitis the local Jobcentre Plus chimes particularly true). It would be easy in another filmmaker's hands to be overwhelmed by the despair and helplessness that Daniel and Katie often feel, but Loach never forgets the small pieces of kindness that make a difference in even the most untenable of situations. A sympathetic Jobcentre adviser and an indulgent supermarket manager both remind us that not everyone is of the opinion that benefit claimants have brought their own troubles upon themselves, and these small but precious slices of humanity do much to keep a focus on the heart of the piece - those left behind when an unsympathetic and out of touch government see the most vulnerable as the first target when it comes to tightening the trouser belt.

But as with life, I, Daniel Blake doesn't come with a neatly tied happy ending. Just as Daniel's perseverance with playing the system by its own rules seems to have won out, he suffers a fatal heart attack while in the bathroom of the very claims centre who are about to end his journey into purgatory. It's a real sucker-punch moment, delivered with alacrity as Daniel's final moments occur off-screen, leaving the emotional fallout of his death to be enacted by the panicked actions of the staff who discover him and the wailing grief of Katie, who having reconciled with Daniel had accompanied him to his review appeal.

Films can make us feel sad, happy, exhilarated and shell-shocked all in the space of a couple of hours, but not often do they leave the viewer seething with anger and shaking their head at a story ripped straight from the tabloid headlines and documentary programmes of our everyday lives. Ken Loach has proved once again that, despite his advancing years, he is as unwilling to go gentle into that good night as he was when he first turned his outraged vision on Britain's underclasses half a century ago. I, Daniel Blake deserves the widest audience possible, from the strata most affected by the events it depicts to the comfortable middle-classes whose understanding stretches only so far as the Daily Mail. Five Star filmmaking on every level, and a priceless document for our uncertain, troubled times.

A heart-breaking, and painful to watch film, that will most likely be turned off by most people looking to escape the reality of the world we live in.

A world where systems and box-ticking prevail. Where conversations are replaced and reduced. Where people come second, and the status quo first. 

This is a movie that shows what life is like for large majorities of proud, earnest people for whom society and it's safety nets have failed them.

Where is our concern for others and our compassion for them? These most human of traits flicker ever so gently throughout the movie - but are constantly blown-out by the tow-the-line minions that we've become.

I challenge you to watch this movie. And to then find a way to confront the reality of what is life for the less fortunate people in your own community, and to help. In whatever way you can.

We are all human beings. Let's start showing it.

Every Palme d'Or winner comes with its own set of expectations and last year's winner of Cannes Film Festival's highest honour is no different. Now I, Daniel Blake may not seem most worthy of all the films that competed for the prestigious award but the topic it brings to light with such alarming authenticity not only makes it an essential cinema but timely as well.

The story of I, Daniel Blake follows its titular character who applies for state welfare after suffering a heart attack but isn't deemed eligible for the benefits. The plot covers his difficult journey as he navigates through the nightmarish benefits system to get what's within his rights as a citizen and also captures his bonding with a single mother caught in a similar scenario.

Directed by Ken Loach, this is my first stint with his works and it's as good a start as any for those wishing to delve into his filmography. The close proximity its set of events maintains with real life scenario throughout its runtime makes it relatable on a universal scale and it's directed with grace, elegance & a biting flair, all kept in equilibrium by its sharp, zany & involving script.

The critical stance it takes against the welfare system is more aimed at the nonsensical procedures that make the whole process more complex & frustrating for the clients, and while it only depicts a certain demographic, the struggle that results from such service is perceivable to all. It has its amusing moments but the sense of despair & disillusionment is evident at all times.

With no score to accompany, no striking camera-work or unorthodox editing, the emphasis remains on its story & characters, and while Loach does a terrific job to handle the story element, the cast bring its scripted people to life with credence. Leading from the front is Dave Johns as Daniel Blake but he's finely supported by Hayley Squires who manages to steal a few moments all by herself.

On an overall scale, I, Daniel Blake is a stimulating piece of smart storytelling that's as endearing as it is heartbreaking. Bringing to surface an issue that has gradually become a matter of concern yet often goes unnoticed in the grand scheme of things, it is an excellently directed, deftly scripted & aptly performed drama that's carefully handled, comfortably told & is engaging for the most part. Thoroughly recommended.

In this Ken Loach (Kes, The Wind that shakes the Barley) directed film, screenplay by Paul Laverty (Even the Rain, The Angels' Share), Dave Johns (Dog Town, Mud) stars as Daniel Blake and Hayley Squires (A Royal Night Out, Complicit) as Katie, the single mother.

A 59 year-old widower who is recovering from a heart attack, Daniel has been advised by his doctor and other health professionals that he is not well enough to return to work but when he is assessed as fit for work meaning he cannot receive benefits, he enters the surreal world of looking for a job he knows he is not well enough to take.

When he sees a single Mum, new to the area and understandably late for her appointment, he tries to help, but Sheila (Sharon Percy: School for Seduction, The Student Prince) is one of the workers who revels in the red tape of their job rather than helping and she insists that security and the job centre security manager (Stephen Clegg in his first role) make them both leave, efficiently doing their job as gatekeepers for the 'decision maker.' As Daniel does odd jobs in her new flat, he gets to know Katie and her two kids, Daisy (Briana Shann in her first role) and Dillon (Dylan Phillip McKeirnan, also in his first role) and they form a strong bond as they try to survive the system that seems determined to ruin their lives.

Johns and Squires are superb as these finely drawn characters that never for a moment don't feel real. Shann feels a little too well spoken for the role, but her acting is spot on, but some of the other actors are not as good yet it never detracts from the film.

This is a powerful film, not shying away from the moral truth of this sad reflection of today's society. Neither Daniel or Katie are trying to 'play the system' and for this they are punished and pushed to their limits. Not a man to take charity, and one who is more used to helping others whether it be caring for his ill wife or his friendship and moral support to a young woman who is essentially a stranger, the film shows how Daniel's former work colleagues and neighbours offer help when he is in crisis, but as a proud man, he does not want to put anyone else in hardship in ease his suffering.

A gritty reflection of a struggle many face, even the colour palette mirrors the slow descent of both of them as the system breaks their spirit. Dry humour intersperses the gloom, when we see Daniel attempting to use the internet to fill in an on-line form or attending a mandatory CV writing workshop, but the grim spectre of helplessness pervades everything. The food bank scene, when circumstances break Daniel and Katie's friendship and when Daisy tries to re-establish contact are particularly heart-wrenching and you can clearly see them deteriorate both mentally and physically.

You could have heard a pin drop throughout most of the movie and at the end, I genuinely don't think there was a dry eye in the house. I think every MP and worker within the system should be made to watch this film. No-one should have to go through something so heartless and inhumane. It is about time compassion was brought back.

An authentic portrayal of an all too real situation that any ordinary person could find themselves in.

Saw this at a silver screen showing at the Odeon . So glad they give films a second run and only £3 . The cinema was packed and by the audience reaction everyone was moved by this kitchen sink piece of realism by Ken Loach. 

I thought this would be a 9.5/10 but the ending secured it as a flawless piece of drama . If Xxx vin diesel or Logan big bucks blockbuster is your thing this may not be for you but this in my view is cinema at its best . 

One man's struggle against the system becomes a metaphor for Britain's broken benefit merry go round . This was not benefit street fly on the floor documentary where you felt more angry watching , this was ironically more real - you really felt for the characters and those who don't even believe in the ridiculous system they're having to operate . It exposes all the flaws in IDS's failed attempt at shaking up the benefit system under the previous U.K. Coalition government. 

You'll find yourself cheering , laughing , silently shouting at the screen and crying - it's a film that touches all the emotions. 

Great acting by Daniel and all of the cast . How did we get to the point where the poorest in our society have the indignity of having to queue for food banks steal sanitary towels ( slight spoiler ) is this England ? 

In the words of Daniel - I am a man not a dog . 

See it , it will move you

"I'm a man, not a dog!" declares a 59-year-old, recently unemployed, carpenter from Newcastle. But his story is precisely that: a state-sponsored gradual metamorphosis of "a man" into "a dog".

In this brutal descent of Daniel Blake into the labyrinthine inferno of modern bureaucracy Ken Loach has shown himself to be a filmmaker of Brechtian caliber. This film is a testament that modern, progressive, and (ostensibly) humanistic capitalism can be perfectly devoid of villains yet be utterly dehumanizing to those it purports to serve.

Yes! Strange, isn't it? In a story where angels have their wings trimmed and their throats slashed with efficiency and precision worthy of Josef Mengele there is no executioners; no evildoers. There are, however, those who do their job and those who, occasionally, need to be instructed on how to do better. And that's the beauty of it. Loach knows that all those people serving this system are (in their own minds) perfectly justified in sleeping well at night. After all, even if all of them create evil ends, none of them individually seem to do anything evil. Loach's project, therefore, is to use Daniel Blake as mirror to our moral complacency and its deadly consequences.

But above all, his "J'accuse" is directed at the system in which doing the right thing becomes irrelevant (even impossible), and in which partisan politics and bottom line define who gets to be human, and who, like Joseph K's last utterance, dies "like a dog!".

"I, Daniel Blake" is a well-made, touching, socially conscious, and multi-layered film. I give it 9 out of 10, a point short of a masterpiece, only because its social criticism is sometimes "too direct". I tend to prefer more articulated and subtle forms of critique.

Daniel is the lead character of the story. He is in his early 60s, an experienced carpenter who cannot work anymore due to his recent heart attack. Halfheartedly, he has applied to receive social support (aka Employment and Support Allowance), but has encountered a dysfunctional and inhumane institution. Another main character is Katie, a single mother with two young kids. She, also, has unsuccessfully turned to the UK's social support system, and same as Daniel, has been disappointed. In her ultimate despair, she turns into prostitution. Daniel and Katie meet each other early in the film and become good friends. They help each other, presumably, without any earthly demands or expectations. The film ends with a speech by Katie who narrates a letter on behalf of Daniel, posthumous.

As far as I can see, the main elements and symbols of the story are as follows:

- Neighbor: China is Daniel's neighbor. He is a lively and energetic boy in his 20s and makes a living semi-illegally. He has a warm and frank relationship with Daniel. In addition to China, the theme of neighbor has a wider presence in the film. In the speech by Katie, Daniel refers to "I look into my neighbors' eyes". Here by "neighbors", Daniel mean "fellow citizens". He is not ashamed of them, because he has paid all his duties. In addition, we know from the film that he usually has a simple and good relationship with people of his neighborhood and wider society. Therefore, we can conclude that all the members of society are, somewhat symbolically, his distributed neighbors.

- Carpenter: Daniel is a carpenter. He cannot work, due to his medical conditions, but he is always available for useful activities. His background as a carpenter is quite pronounced in the film. He seems to constantly engage in making wooden objects in his leisure time at home. When Daisy, Katie's daughter, asks Daniel "Are you a soldier?", he replies "No. I am more dangerous than that. I am a carpenter!" 

- Prostitute: Katie who is rejected by the UK's social system is forced into prostitution. Daniel is her main, and apparently only, friend.

- Fish: Daniel carves wooden fish and use them in decorative objects. Fish is his main icon. He gives one of his handmade objects to Daisy. Later, when he has to sell his furniture to a second hand dealer, he refuses to sell his hand-tools and the decorative thing which he has built with wooden fish. "They are not for sale", Daniel says.

- Privatization, dysfunctional institutions, and the authoritarian state: In the social support offices, there are many references to the fact that social services have become increasingly privatized, and run for private profit, rather than the public good. If I am not wrong (English is not my mother tongue), I think I heard a short reference to privatization of police. The state is presented as a cold, distant, techno-centric, and rather brutal institution. The fact that some groups of society, like Daniel or Katie, are excluded from its support is presented as a rule, rather than an exception. In many shots, we see warning signs which inform the coverage of the area by security cameras. Security guards are present, vocal, and confident, more than the employees who are supposed to help the underprivileged citizens. The dysfunctional institution in not delivering what it is supposed to deliver, but this does not stop it to call the police when there is a small dissidence, and the police arrives within minutes, ready to impose the cold rule of law on the voiceless protester.

- Change: Daniel has trained hands and knows how to make and fix things. But he is computer illiterate and runs into problem when he is forced by an increasingly computerized public services. The younger generation are computer literate. But this generational gaps is not one directional. It goes both ways. When Daniel wants to play a cassette for Daisy, she has no clue what a cassette is and how it can be played in a player. 

I think many of these symbols are there to construct a parallel with the story of the Christ. Jesus, too, was a carpenter by profession. He also emphasized on the importance of neighbors, in a very special and universal way (the story of the good Samaritan). He and Mary Magdalene, a prostitute woman, became good friends. He belonged to the underprivileged parts of society, and focused on the poor and the marginalized. Eventually, he was murdered by the state. Perhaps, Ken Loach and Paul Laverty (the writer) are trying to tell us something by embedding these symbols in the story.

Christ was a peaceful but radically revolutionary figure. He was killed by the state, but ultimately transformed an empire. Are the film makers telling us that the likes of Daniel Blake are modern Christ-like figures in disguise?

I think this is a decent film. I feel like there was something missing to actually make it great. I don't think it deserved to win over Toni Erdmann at the Cannes Film Festival, but it's still worth a viewing. More than anything, it requires viewing for Hayley Squires, who manages to be the best in the case and really elevates the material. I kind of wish the film was entirely revolved around her. The best thing to be said about the film other than her is that it's not entirely predictable and it does resemble real life in many ways. There are a lot of interesting and significant themes that the film is working with and issues that it is trying to address, and for that it should be respected.
