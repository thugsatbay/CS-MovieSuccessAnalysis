### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I saw Inside Llewyn Davis in a sold out matinée in Union Square, NYC last weekend. The city was cold and dreary, much like the 1960s Manhattan depicted in this film. I sat with my friend after the movie and basically railed against the film for the first ten minutes before slowly admitting that my criticisms were obviously the intended result and that the Coen Brothers have once again made a great movie that is simply not easy to digest and certainly not fun to digest. 

I'll lead with the greatness. The underlying takeaway of this film is that the actual creation of music - the sound, the beauty and the lyrical story - can embody some of the best attributes about humanity and yet, the creator of such music can nonetheless lack all such attributes and essentially be as ugly a person as his music is beautiful. That is the takeaway, and the Coen Bros intentionally force this upon the viewer. The folk songs song by Lleywn serve as calming beautiful interludes and as stark contrasts to the plot driven by a character who is simply put, a terrible human being stuck in an extremely frustrating, self-made vacuum of an existence. 

I assume that most people, like me, gravitate toward wanting to root for the struggling artist. There is a nobility in pursuing your dreams when such dreams consist of the pursuit of an art form. Here, folk music is put on a pedestal and LLewyn's pursuit of it is from the outset, something the audience implicitly will support. In the course of 90 minutes, the Coen Bros force you to question this support, hate the lead character and eventually cheer when he gets punched in the face. 

The problem is simple. I did not want any more of LLewyn Davis after 90 minutes. I did not want to hear his music anymore because the lyrics he sung were fraudulent, the beauty of his playing, a guise. And due to his self-made failings throughout the film, I no longer cared where his story went. The Coen Bros could have taken the plot line in any number of ways to give the viewer some foothold to hope that Llewyn may end up on the right track one day. They do not give you that foothold, and for that reason, I was pretty ready for this movie to end when it did. This is admittedly a criticism, but more an observation. I certainly do not need films to end with rainbows and hearts, but this script really forces you to watch a man stuck in a static world where his own actions cause him to go nowhere, and that is a frustrating world to inhabit for 90 minutes.

The best parts of the film are not the Manhattan scenes, but the drive LLewyn takes to Chicago. The Coen Bros have used the theme of "driving at night" time and time again to make some great scenes, usually emotionally charged personal voyages. This is no different. Their cinematography and over all character driven story telling shines when their lead characters hit the road. The bit characters are fun and unusual in the Coen Bro's way, but do little to ease the 90 minutes of crass, immature, self-defeating, out-of-touch and eventually just pathetic life movements from Lleywn's character

For Coen Brother fans, its worth the journey; for general movie fans, be warned, as this is an interesting film, but arguably not an enjoyable one.

Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a follower of the  filmmaking Coen Brothers, then you are quite aware of their complete  lack of artistic interest in any traditionally successful character.  Their work is inspired by life's obstacles and tough luck, even if  brought on by a character's own poor judgment. Coen Brother stories  revolve around those who carry on and have (blind?) faith that their  approach, no matter how ill conceived, is the only option ... the only  path worth taking. Their main character this time out seems to think  life is filled with only careerists (sell-outs) or losers (those who  can't get a break). 
The titular Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) is introduced to us  onstage at the Gaslight singing a beautiful folk song. Moments later he  is lying in the back alley after taking a whipping from a mysterious  stranger. It's not until this scene is repeated again at the film's end  do we understand the cause of this effect. See, Llewyn is not a very  likable guy. We learn he is still grieving from the suicide of his  musical partner (as sung by Marcus Mumford), and that he bounces from  sofa to sofa amongst acquaintances and family members. Llewyn has no  friends, only acquaintances too kind to throw him out ... even if he  might be the father of an unwanted baby, or if he accidentally allows a  beloved pet cat to escape. 
The story is based in the folk music scene of 1961 Greenwich Village in  the pre-Bob Dylan days. The Coen's were inspired by the memoirs of Dave  Van Ronk entitled "The Mayor of MacDougal Street". So while the songs  are real and the characters are often inspired or based upon real  artists of the time, Llewyn's story is pure Coen fiction. That means  cringing, levels of discomfort, uneasy chuckling and moments of rapture  ... such as John Goodman evoking a drugged out Doc Promus spewing harsh  poetic diatribes. 
We never really know if the Coens are making a statement or tossing it  out for us to debate. Are they saying that even the ugliness of  Llewyn's personality can produce something as beautiful as music, or  are they saying that we get tricked by beautiful music into thinking  that the artist must also be pure? Carey Mulligan (as Jean) has one of  the film's best and most insightful lines when she tells Llewyn he is  "King Midas' idiot brother". Her pure disgust (and expert rendering of  the F-word) and anger contrasts with her angelic onstage persona with  husband Jim (Justin Timberlake). 
As always, the Coens provide us a constant flow of interesting and  oddball characters. In addition to Goodman's jazz hipster, we get  Garrett Hedlund as an ultra cool (til he's not) valet, Adam Driver as a  cowboy folk singer, Troy Nelson as a virtuous Army folk singer (based  on Tom Paxton), and Llewyn's Upper East side cat owners, his spunky  sister, and best of all F Murray Abraham as Bud Grossman, the owner of  Chicago's Gate of Horn club. Based on the real Albert Grossman who  discovered Peter, Paul and Mary, and managed Bob Dylan, Grossman is the  lone witness to Llewyn's audition. This may be the most touching  musical moment of the movie ("The Death of Queen Jane"), but it's  clearly the wrong song for the moment. 
Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis. He captures that crisis of  self that's necessary for an artist whose talent and passion is just  out of step with societal changes. We feel his pain, but fail to  understand the lack of caring he often displays towards others. We get  how his need for money overrides his artistic integrity as he  participates in the novelty song "Please Mr Kennedy". Why Isaac's  performance is not garnering more Oscar chat is beyond my  understanding. It's possibly due to the fact that the movie and his  character are not readily accessible to the average movie goer. Some  thought and consideration is required. 
If you are expecting a feel good nostalgic trip down the folk singer  era of Greenwich Village, you will be shocked and disappointed.  Instead, brace yourself for the trials of a talented musician who  believes the music should be enough. Speaking of music, the immensely  talented T Bone Burnett is the man behind the music and it's  fascinating to note how he allows the songs to guide us through the  story and keep us ever hopeful of better days. This is the Coen  Brothers at their most refined and expert.

Saw the prescreening at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, MI with average expectations, this is my reaction:

This film is an experience, but not for any sort of superficial special effects, action or CGI. It's an experience in which you will feel fear, joy, hate, hope, sorrow and contempt all within an hour and 45 minutes that feels more like 15 minutes. We are sidelined, watching a short snippet of Llewyn's seemingly dismal life, drudge on by, yet we are drawn. We connect with Lleywn's anger and struggles, as if we too are burdened by his failures and challenges. But amongst the bad, there are moments of cheer, and laughter and peace reminding us that good still exists. What dominates is power, balanced by music, money and pride, yet this movie is better served as a reminder that life is an experience, and individualistic. We are reminded that more often than not, things do not fall into place and luck is rarely on our side. But no matter how many times people fail you, one should never fail, before one's self. This movie is an experience, it indirectly breaths life into each of our souls, and should appeal to anyone in touch with the most crucial human emotions: compassion and empathy. Hold on tight, because it is one experience that will remain with you long after the credits are through. Perfectly casted, perfectly scripted, perfectly filmed; perfectly entertaining.

No doubt: Llewyn Davis is a loser. First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it. 
Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature. The film opens with a  long scene in which Davis (Oscar Isaac) performs a sad old folk song.  The camera gently hovers around him, catches the hushed, intensely  attentive atmosphere of the smoky basement club, while he sucks his  audience  us  into the dark, sorrowful world he creates in his song,  hinting at a depth he so often will not show in "real life". It is this  contrast, the dialogue between the sadly funny tale of a modern Don  Quixote and that other, older, tenderer story, the music tells. For as  much as this is Llewyn's story, it also is that of the redeeming power  of music. For even if Davis is the same at the end as the story comes  full circle and returns to its opening, as he once again gets beaten up  and is succeeded on stage by a young, cocky folk singer with a nasal  voice who will soon change music  and not just folk music  forever,  there is just the tiniest hint that this Llewyn Davis might have some  sort of promise after all, maybe not as a successful singer, but as a  human being. 
Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired loosely by the story of Dave van Ronk,  a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene around the time of Bob  Dylan's arrival there in 1961. Dylan learned a lot from van Ronk and  stole some of his most promising songs, but that is a story to be told  another day. This one is about a man lost in a world that hasn't been  waiting for him, who has a mission that is entirely his own. The  lengths to which he goes to show the world he doesn't care are  astounding. And yet he craves love. Oscar Isaac is a miracle: even in  his most repelling state, in his most rejecting attitude, there is a  flicker of sad longing in his face, his eyes, a face the Coens show us  much of. It is one you need to dive into, closed to the casual observer  but hiding so much pain and uncertainty and desire to live one  sometimes thinks it must explode. The Coens' cinema is one of subtlety,  of nuanced, of shades of grey between the black and white. In Isaac,  they have found their perfect actor, heading a stellar cast including  Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Justin Timberlake. 
As so often, the Coen brothers are masters at creating an atmosphere, a  universe of its own, unique as well as absolutely consistent. It is a  world of the night, in which grey shades reign, days are pale and dust  is everywhere. Even in the open there is a sense of narrowness, of  tight spaces, lightless basements that are cage and protective space in  one. It is the tiny holes that provide the only rooms for creativity,  for the soul to speak. And so it is that the dark world of the  underground gradually regains some warmth and coziness, the dark  becomes a zone of comfort, while everything else becomes cold and  distant. 
Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a  comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. It is a Quixotic tale full  of quirky characters at time bordering on the fairy-tale like   especially true for the sequence around Goodman's character, a  trodden-down mixture of villain and clown that calls up associations of  the expressionist nightmare world of their earlier film Barton Fink.  The other foot of the film is firmly on the ground, in the existential  struggle of a man the world won't welcome. But there is still that  third element: music, that timeless realm of love and pain and  suffering and hope. It is here the film is anchored, it is here this  Don Quixote conquers his windmills, armed solely with his guitar. It is  here it all comes together. Tragedy, comedy, fairy tale, social drama,  held together by the softest of touches. Another Coen brothers  masterpiece. What else could be expected?

Inside Llewyn Davis is a hard film to quantify. It is very much a Coen Brothers movie, and it is very much its own thing. I did not know the history of the story. I did not know the story behind the Gaslight club in New York nor did I know of the famous figure who started at the bar back in 1961 when the film takes place. I found out after the film was over. However, not knowing that, I still thought this was an incredible movie.

There are oddly poetic scenes in the film. There is a scene where the main character Llewyn Davis hits a cat with his car. As he watches the cat limp away into the darkness injured, I felt that it was an interesting image that seemed to mirror Llewyn's life in the film. Although I was aware of the poetic aspect of the film, I did not feel that they were forced moments. In interviews the Coen Brothers always seem to play dumb. In an interview for this film the Coen Brothers talked about the cat in the movie, and how they didn't know what to do with the story, so they threw in a cat. Anybody who has seen a Coen Brothers movie can appreciate that this is far from the truth. Every moment and image seems to be very specifically placed, and that was the case for this movie as well.

You can't judge this movie the same way you would judge every other film this year. It's almost as if the Coen Brothers have their own language that they are speaking, that the audience does not fully understand. We catch some things, and even with those few moments, I was mesmerized. Sometimes I really notice their style like in their film A Serious Man, and I find myself confused and bored, but this film felt very true to me. I sympathized with the main character and his struggles, perhaps because I consider myself a creative person as well, so I know how hard it is. At one point Llewyn says, "I'm just so f-ing tired," this line says a lot more than just I want to sleep. It is something we can all relate to, a feeling of just wanting to give up, and in this way, the story is a universal one, but then again it's the Coen Brothers, so automatically I know some people might not like it, but I loved it.

Inside Llewyn Davis is an intimate, well-executed, and honest slice of life. It features a humanistic, heartfelt performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular folk singer, arresting cinematography, and a sharp, tight-fisted script by the Coen brothers, who also directed.

It's Greenwich Village in the early sixties, when folk music was either coming into its own or ready to be usurped by a more mainstream genre. Llewyn has no home, drifting from gig to gig and crashing on couch after couch as a matter of design; is vagrancy is his life's plan. Llewyn is at turns a noble soul who exists for the sake of making the music he wants to make and a resentful twerp who mooches off friends just to sustain his unsustainable lifestyle.

The movie is only somewhat linear, with closing scenes mirroring opening scenes, and it is told entirely from Llewyn's point of view. The Coen brothers masterfully show us not only Llewyn's perspective but also an outside perspective; this allows us to feel both empathy and loathing toward him.

Llewyn is nothing if not complex. The movie does a terrific job of avoiding the usual clichés, such as a down-on-his-luck musician catching a lucky break, or a bitter man having a quick change of heart. It's not that Llewyn is constantly sneering at everyone, holding his poverty up as both a shield and a trophy, it's that he is so multilayered that when he does a kind act or offers some praise or thanks, we don't feel that his doing so is in any way out of character. Llewyn is a self-tortured soul, but unlike caricatures of wandering folkies, he is at his center a realist, albeit a prideful one.

During his travels and travails, Llewyn encounters people ranging from the genuine (his singing friends Jim and Jean, played by Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan) to the absurd (a rotund, blustery John Goodman). Oh, and a cat that travels with Llewyn - at least until he can get him or her back to the owner. The encounters with the genuine folks feel just as normal as if you or I encountered them; those with the more absurd of the lot feel perfectly surreal, and when they do end one almost wonders if we've all imagined the encounters through Llewyn himself.

The music is beautiful and moving. Isaac himself performs Llewyn's songs, with a sweet, vulnerable voice that offers a touch of soul to Llewyn's otherwise-bleak surroundings. When Llewyn is really on, you can feel his pain leap right off the screen into your brain; when he appears to be going through the motions and not singing from his heart, you can feel the lack of depth that his intended audience also feels. Isaac is just flat-out terrific.

Ultimately, it is Isaac and the music that push this film into the territory of great cinema. The story itself is stark, moody, unyielding - just like a New York City winter, really. And the movie, like Llewyn's own life, appears to have no point - except to illustrate just how pointless Llewyn is making his life, through his stubborn marriage to his craft and a desire to stay uprooted

It's amazing how dazzled one can be by so very little these days. There's very little here--a struggling unpleasant man who sings his heart out about standard "folk" catastrophes but can't take care of himself as he goes about damaging others, and animals as well. He's your 50's college roommate who cooks on a hot plate and sings about historic heroic starvations. The in- and-out mythic references are unfocused and a game for undergraduates. When the Coens go flat it's not even E flat. We're forced to watch this guy's face for an hour or so without a clue to his demons; he's just a jerk, a driven jerk but a jerk nonetheless. 

Best part is the recreation of the early 60's in cars, atmospheres, but then John Goodman shows up from "Where art thou?" and spoils the realistic angst. Sorry, but the early folk scene wasn't this creepy and Bob Dylan didn't rescue it from oblivion or creepiness. Without a political or sexual agenda (it got you chicks) it did flounder, but it needed an audience for shifting values and social awareness. One's suffering couldn't just be for one's art, but had to have a social dimension that this guy can't see. A genius before his time? Hardly--a guy who can't take care of himself, or his friends or family or lovers--anything but "folk." The times they were a changin', but this guy's a talented pathetic scrounge and lacks the connections to others and society that might propel him to sing for the changing times.

This might be the ethos of the Coens and their films themselves--within society but not of it. Their characters struggle with their messy quirky lives but we see them as curiosities rather than representatives of anything important. There's a certain clown show aspect to their films, which creates their charm and fun but little else.

At some point of this the folk singer we've been following is stranded at night by the side of the road in a car with possibly a dead man and a cat, another man has just been arrested by police for not much of a reason. He gets out to hitch a ride and there's only a cold, indifferent night with strangers in their cars just going about.

This is the worldview the Coens have been prodding, sometimes for a laugh, sometimes not. I can't fault them, it does seem to be inexplicably cold out there some nights. They're thinkers first of all, intellectuals, so it stings them more so they try to think up ways of mocking that thinker who is stung by the cold to amuse themselves and pass the night. 

So this is what they give us here. A joyless man for no particular reason, who plays decent music that people enjoy or not for no particular reason, who the universe has turned against. The Coens don't pretend to have any particular answer either of why this is, why the misery. It might have something to do with having lost a friend, something to do with not having learned to be simply grateful for a small thing. It might have something to do with something he did, the initial beating up in the alley is there to insert this. Sometimes it's just something that happens as random as a cat deciding to step out of the door and the door closing before you can put it back in. Most of the time it all kind of snowballs together.

It's a noir device (the beating - cat) bundling guilt with chance so we'll end up with a clueless schmuck whose own contribution to the nightmare is inextricable from the mechanics of the world. The Coens have mastered noir so they trot it here with ease: the more this anti-Dude fails to ease into life the more noir anomaly appears around him.

Of course the whole point is that it's not such a bad setup; people let him crash in their apartment, a friend finds him a paying gig, somehow he ends up on a car to Chicago where he's offered a job. It's not great either, but somewhere in there is a pretty decent life it could all amount to, provided he settles for less than his dream. (This means here a dream the self is attached to). I saw this after a documentary on backup singers, all of them profoundly troubled for having settled for less, all of them nonetheless happy to be able to do their music.

Still, 'The incredible journey', seen on the Disney poster, may in the end amount to no more than an instinctive drive through miles of wilderness. The Coens are cold here even for their standards. I wouldn't be surprised to find it was Ethan, the more introverted of the two, ruminating on a meaningless art without his partner.

Is there a way out in the end? Here's the trickiest part, especially for an intelligent mind. You can't just kid yourself with any other happiness like Hollywood has done since Chaplin. You know it has to be invented to some degree, the point of going on, yet truthful. Nothing here. More music, a reflection. It's the emptiest part of the film as if they didn't know themselves what to construct to put him back on stage. Visually transcending was never their forte anyway. They merely end up explaining the wonderful noir ambiguity of that first beating.

Still they are some of the most dependable craftsmen we have and in the broader Coen cosmos this sketches its own space.

"If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it's a folk song."

The Coen brothers have worked together over the past couple of decades delivering some inspiring work. Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.

The film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. 

I'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.

As I walked out of the theater where my friend and I had just paid $11 each to see this film, I thought to myself, "Well, maybe next time they'll actually make a movie." Because I would not really consider this a movie. It is a half-baked, moody character sketch of an unbelievable character. As another reviewer pointed out, Llewyn Davis is quite good looking and capable of performing passionately. To think that not one of the women in the clubs he plays would offer him a place to sleep for the night is absurd. That is only one example of how the film favors contrivance over believability. John Goodman's character is another big one. 

The movie is a pointless waste of time, a dreary faux-odyssey about a character who is such an awful, self-centered person that you could not possibly care what happens to him. But don't worry, because nothing happens to him. The film ends as it begins, with him getting beaten up for being a selfish jerk. As many have pointed out, this movie does not capture the heady, vibrant spirit of the early 60s folk scene in NYC. If you want that, read Bob Dylan's wonderful Chronicles, Vol. I. 

I've enjoyed many of the Coen Brothers films, but they just phoned this one in, I guess. Or they've become so enamored with their own Hollywood brilliance that they can't tell good from bad. And Hollywood is so shallow and moronic that I would not be surprised if this gets nominated for "Best Film." Yeah, right. 

I enjoy a lot of folk music, from early Dylan to Nick Drake and many others, but the songs in this film were long and boring and unmemorable. Huge amounts of the film are devoted to Llewyn singing ENTIRE SONGS (like five or six minute long songs) that are in no way remarkable. I guess that's the point, since he's supposed to be failure. Instead of devoting film time to character or plot development, to comedy or entertainment, we are supposed to be entranced somehow by the emotion of this fake music. I guess it worked magic on professional film critics. The "Please Mr. Kennedy" novelty song was beyond stupid. And when Davis abandoned the cat in the car with the passed out, possibly even dead, Goodman character, I thought, "Screw this guy! I hate him. I hope he gets beaten up again. I'll beat him up." 

As a work of art, which it clearly aspires to be, this movie lacks intricacy, depth, or insight. The Coens already covered this material with Barton Fink, which I've always enjoyed, but BF was a much more satisfying and entertaining film. I'd rather go see a mindless Star Trek movie than something this pretentious and intentionally pointless. I don't want to see it again, not even for a buck at Redbox. This is the worst Coen Bros movie I've seen.

I read the other reviews here and am at a loss for words. When it ended, my wife turned to me and said it was awful. I told her it was very, very dull. A stranger in front of us also hated the film. There was a blow-up of a review of the movie in the lobby, and about twenty or thirty audience members were clustered in front of it, no doubt trying to reconcile the review with the cinematic lobotomy we had just endured. The only things I liked about the movie were seeing Dad's old 1961 Chrysler Newport on the street, and F. Murray Abraham. I respect all other reviewers' opinions, but this is mine. And yes, I've seen other Coen brothers films and liked them.

There have been movies made about musicians, both real and imagined, from End of the Century through I'm Not There, taking in The Future is Unwritten and A Mighty Wind. We've had almost every conceivable approach, from straight-up documentary through imagined version of events as well as completely invented bands, singers, songs, and concerts. Yet, I don't think that anyone has ever managed to do what the Coen Brothers have produced with this tragic, comedic, touching piece.

Which is to essentially transport you into the grooves of an LP, Inside Llewyn Davies, and bring you a beautifully realised portrayal of the eponymous hero as he trudges his weary way through the greys and greens of Greenwich Village in a cold New York. And it is so reminiscent of the experience of listening to your favourite vinyl album from track one, side one to the final track of side two, whilst curling up on the couch with a cat in your lap, listening to a selection of melodic, melancholic, traditional, and new folk music.

The music binds this movie together and Oscar Issac inhabits the title role in a world-weary way that aches with ennui and longs for something never expressed. We follow his tramping travails through a range of vignettes that build subtly towards creating a quite compelling picture of the man behind the music. He sometimes does what we expect and at other junctures, veers off in a mad new direction. There is little explanation for any of the decisions that he does, or doesn't, take. He's searching without any clear idea of the quest.

Along the way, we meet a wonderfully diverse bunch of supporting characters, from the biting Jean, acerbic tongue and acid looks, through the snoring bully Roland Turner and his valet Johnny Five, as well as Mitch and Lilian, the Upper West posh couple, but especially Ulysses, our hero's apparent companion over the week (or was s/he?). They all offer opportunities to understand Davies' psyche slightly more, albeit admitting that not even he appears to be fully cognisant himself.

It's a lovely looking film, beautifully shot and much more enjoyable that I would have believed possible from watching the trailer previously. T Bone Burnett has done a sterling job on the soundtrack, it's so affecting and the way that the songs are all allowed to play out saw the audience in the cinema in which I saw this mainly remaining seated through the end credits as well. Which brings me back to the vinyl album sensation. You don't pick up the needle when your favorite record is playing the final track, because you want to get on with something else instead. No. You let it run right to the end of the groove and then your heart fills with an equal mixture of pleasure and joy, sorrow and sighs, as the last bars fade to quiet and all that's gone before becomes a memory that's so strong and so addictive that you want to turn it over and put the needle back into the groove all over again.

This movie is precisely like that sensation and I loved it, from first frame to last. A quiet understated tragi-comedy, dark in places, and shadowy in others, but with a humanity and a compassion that you cannot avert our gaze from. Hell, it's even got a coda of a scene to be dealing with, which at the end takes your mind back to the start of the production and forces one to reexamine what has just passed before your eyes. Recommended.

I am not one of those people to be as dramatic to say "I want two hours of my life back " , but am thankful for the part of my brain that suppresses awful awful memories. I am a huge Coen brothers fan , but this movie has much appeal as a Rolf Harris benefit concert. Nothing happens in the film , and not in a Seinfeld sort of humorous/witty way , but more in a waiting at a doctors room for an appointment sort of way. More disappointing was the clichéd story line. Without giving anything away , Llewyn loses a cat, finds it the next day and then returns it to the owner , and I am sure you can guess what happens next. The same thing happens when he records a single and signs away any royalty benefits.There is no character development that occurs in other Coen films. I have no idea what they were thinking , but they were not thinking of making a good film when they may this - In short , please avoid !

Because there is so much wrong about this movie it is hard to choose with which flaw to start with.

It never feels like 1961. It never looks like 1961. It doesn't sound like 1961. It does not deal with the Greenwich Village folk music scene.  It is not a portrait of an artist. It has no story. It has no arc of suspense. It has no character to connect with. It has no development of characters. It has no

Okay:

Let us start with the main character and its impersonator: Oscar Isaac. Every minute of the movie he looks like an H&M-Model of 2014. His stylish beard is 2014. His frustrated and cynical habitus is 2014. Even the way he wears is shawl is 2014.  His central conflict is that he screws up everything. Not to forget about his ex-partner that threw himself of the bridge, but there is no story developing out of this. So the central conflict is that he is a depressed asshole? But not only the script leaves him as a blank sheet of (grey) paper. Also Oscar Isaac is not able to give his character any depth. He seems to be indifferent about anything: his ex-lovers, his parents, his friends, the political issues of the time and even about his music.

And here the roots of next big error are hidden: The folk scene of the early sixties was most vivid, new, exciting, political, enthusiastic, social. People had an attitude! Llewyn Davis has none. 

The folk scene in this movie seems to be some dull melting pot for bored ridiculous freaks sitting around in dark cellars doing nothing else except whining and selling out. You never get the feeling of it to be the musical outcome of the beat generations efforts and the preparation for the groundbreaking things to come in the late sixties! In one dialogue Llewyn Davis even says that he considers himself to be part of the entertainment business"! And that is what the folk scene of that time absolutely was NOT! When Dylan electrified his sound in 65 he was accused to go commercial and to become a part of the entertainment business. A lot of people actually hated him for this. In their eyes he became something that wasn't "folk" anymore!

Well enough. This movie does not deserve to waste more of my time.

In the end the whole flick looks like it was made to demonstrate how depressing, dull and meaningless live has been before the invention of the smart phone...

I hope the Coen Brothers will recover and create descent movies again.

I loved Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?, so I had high hopes for this flick. I came away very disappointed. It is a slice of life, a week in the life of a struggling folk musician in 1961. My problem is that the main character is pretty much in the same place at the end as at the beginning. Here's the thing: A slice of life, go nowhere movie, with no transformation of the main character, is probably not going to be my cup of tea in almost any case. That said, I do think it can work when it is biographic. Because for a realistic, biographic slice of life, we get to see REAL LIFE, down and dirty, including the reality that sometimes there is no great triumph, no big personal transformation, etc. So, if you give me a window into the true life of an individual, that can be great even without an evolving character, or any triumphant moment.

However, if you give me a phony, contrived fictional piece, and you force me to sit through contrived moments, my "reward" is to get paid off with a clever ending where everything comes together and stuff foreshadowed at the beginning is realized at the end. A fictional story allows the writer to create a slice of life that has a great symmetry and harmonious movement lacking in real life. And it's frankly part of the bargain you make when you start shoving contrivances down the throat of the audience.

So, my problem with this movie is that it simply was not realistic / biographical enough, but instead it was full of contrivances...yet it still went nowhere. Contrivances that serve no purpose to move towards a happy (or tragic) coincidence at the end? Why bother? Take some examples: We see this guy perform, and it's clear he has something special, with his guitar and voice. No way this guy does not have some chicks ready to hook up with him after the way he plays on stage. So why is he begging for a couch to sleep on from near strangers? Given how we see he is fine mooching off people, it is frankly inexplicable that he is not mooching of any of the adoring Greenwich Village groupies he must surely have from his performances. So his desperate near homelessness, despite his great musical skill and having been in the area for some time (i.e., not a newcomer) makes no sense to me.

We also see him visiting his father, and his sister, so apparently his whole family is local to the New York area, which again begs the question how he got to be 30-ish and needing to beg strangers for a couch to sleep on, in his own home town. His sort of living seems more appropriate if (a) he was new to the area, and (b) he was not all that good or polished with his music.

Another contrivance: When he loses the tabby cat, and finds a near identical cat right around the corner. I mean, come on! That color, and size, cat, and quality of grooming, eyes, etc., that's got to be pretty rare for cats wandering the streets of New York, it's definitely not your average alley cat, in coloration or size. So for him to find this identical but wrong cat, so we can have a big confrontational moment, is a blatant contrivance.

It seems like the writers were looking for ways to create contrivances to screw with the main character, to mess up his life intentionally, as if to say, "sucks to be you." Again, what's the point? I mean, if this were truly biographical, it would tell me something about the nature of the universe. But since it is a fiction -- and we know the guy it was loosely based on was nothing like the character in the film except in the most superficial sense -- we are not learning anything except that the writers can think of ways to kick some one when they are down. But I kind of know that already, so I learn nothing of value.

At the end of the movie, we have now seen the main character find out he probably has a two year old son he never saw, but he decided not to go look for him when he passed by that town and had the opportunity. We see he chose to take a flat fee for music, and there is some hint the song will turn out to be a hit and he will later kick himself for not having any royalty rights, but we never see that develop.

I'd also note that to care about the movie, to be moved by it, you have to identify with the main character. But he is just flat out unlikeable. And with the writers throwing contrived tragedies at him, you don't want to link up emotionally with him. So without that, without caring about this jerk who will heckle a poor old woman just because he's having a bad day, how are you supposed to be moved any direction by his failures and lack of success? It just makes no sense, I don't see how audiences get moved by the pap.

On the positive, I think there is some beautiful music, and some beautiful imagery. There is perhaps some poetry to the audio-visual elements, and a nice timing, variation, with some of the dramatic moments, but honestly that's just too little, like a cake that is beautifully decorated with sweet icing but dry and tasteless in the middle.

Well, that's my 2 cents.

I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring. The cat was the best thing about this picture and I'm a dog person.

Inside Llewyn Davis seems, on the surface, to be making a simple point: creating art is difficult and rarely turns out like the happy tales which adorn the lucky few who become successful and notable. Beneath this thin cover, we have utterly ghastly condemnation of human nature. The repugnant conclusion to the dark and often brilliant existentially despairing Coen oeuvre.

Absolutely none of the characters in the film display any noble traits whatsoever. The protagonist is a fairly good musician, who like so many in real life, can't and don't get the Big Break. From that bitter locus we have radiating out a dismal miasma of horrible people and horrible circumstances.

A cheating agent and his utterly callous secretary. A foul mouthed, perpetually angry and needlessly scathing love interest. A scolding and perpetually angry sister. A father who can't be bothered to speak. A lecherous vile club owner. Vapid, uninteresting contemporaries. Bitter and judgmental characters without punctuation or distraction.

It's an orgy of self-piteous, disappointed and disappointing schmucks. The environment is relentlessly cold, wintry and grey. It is miserable.

The protagonist's musical partner is understood to have committed suicide jumping from New York City's George Washington bridge prior to the events which transpire in the film. The parting shot in which the protagonist shouts "au revoir" after the taxi transporting away a shadowy, mephistophelian husband who, moments before, has savagely beaten the protagonist in an alley, can only be viewed as a suicide note.

The character has nothing left. His music is a failure. His family is a failure. His love life is a failure. His day job is a failure. He is utterly friendless and alone in the world. His next option seems but one.

And in a truly vile and reprehensible way, it's as if the authors of the film stand jeering just off camera urging "jump, you loser".

Luckily life is not, cannot EVER be, this bad. In many ways, it is deeply irresponsible to bring such a horribly discouraging and depressing work before the public. It is such a lopsided portrayal of living as to be laughably unrealistic.

I for one, have lost loved ones, been homeless for an extended period, lost lovers, jobs, hopes and dreams. There is and always will be some light and joyful counterbalance in the universe even in the darkest moments. Perhaps the Coen brothers need to go to a good church service, or minimally watch a Monty Python movie. Smile a bit. 

To display such great contempt for the subject, at a certain point, simply becomes self-referentially contemptible.

"Life is a tale told by an idiot ( or "King Midas' idiot little brother" ), full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." That is the message this film has for you. Avoid it. Sadomasochistic, vicious intellectual smut.

The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.' 

The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so. 

The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s. 

Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.

'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.

Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!

It's like a gust of wind that never stops. I was altered, disturbed and amused by the clarity of this poets. From Joel and Ethan to Bruno Delbonnel, Oscar Isaac, to T Bone Burnett and everyone who enters, even for an instant, this sublime, unique, startling P.O.V. Aware but never condescending to the audience. No explanation as to why this story deserved to be told. The answers are private, deeply personal, enlightening and, at times, chillingly transparent. The face of Oscar Isaac, my God! For me one of the most enthralling discoveries of 2013. At times it reminded me of an updated character in an Italian Neo-realistic film, others one of those images from one of Martin Donovan's sessions. I sat through Inside Llewyn Davis twice in a row. I can't wait to repeat the experience soon again.

In the mixed up world of Coen works, Inside Llewyn Davis stands as a rather unique piece against the hilarious misadventures of films such as The Big Lebowski (1998), Raising Arizona (1987) and O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000). I'm tempted to compare this latest work to No Country For Old Men (2007), but even then, No Country's morbid tone is at odds with the poetic soul of Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). The film follows a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a mildly known folk singer, embodying a Bob Dylan-esque sort of life in 1960's New York, as he plays little-attended shows at The Gaslight Café in the West Village. Painted as the unsung genius, Llewyn is at a standstill in his life as he struggles to survive on what little money he has, and on what few friendships remain. One such friendship that draws particular focus is the complex ties between Llewyn, and fellow musicians, Jean (Carey Mulligan) and Jim (Justin Timberlake). While Llewyn holds the raw roots of his soulful folk above all else, Jean and Jim test the waters of mainstream accessibility and stardom, a life that Llewyn holds in little regard. At the risk of revealing too much about the plot, Llewyn is loaded down with constant rejection, grapples with his relationship with his father, and eventually drives to Chicago in a last-ditch effort to salvage his meagre career. 

Though Inside Llewyn Davis is at its heart, a beautifully understated profile, it has some wonderfully funny moments as well - the best of which concerning the tabby cat who more than once, manages to derail Llewyn's already arduous life. One brilliant scene observes a shouting match over the cat's lack of scrotum. 

There are a few fresh faces to the Coen-verse with Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and Oscar Isaac in the titular role, but there's one Coen regular whom I'm always jazzed to see. Barging unapologetically into this reflective space, is the coked-up, crutch-wielding, ass hole jazz man, Roland Turner, played by the large and loud John Goodman. Toss in Steve Buscemi and I'd feel right at home!

Like their 2000 film, O Brother, Where Art Thou, the Coen Brothers took on the talent of T-Bone Burnett to arrange their collection of folk covers. With every soulful performance or every toe- tapping rendition, it's the music of Llewyn Davis that will send you head over heels for the film. Acting as a stark contrast to the grey, frost-licked New York City, the warm passion of the soundtrack is the lifeblood of this beautiful film.

In its running time of 105 minutes, few definite conclusions are drawn in regard to Llewyn's career and with the film ending in the same place as it started, it seems unlikely that he will break free from his cycle of obscurity. But then, the film really isn't about Llewyn's 'career' or his friends, because this is a film about Llewyn. The beginnings of the film highlight a raw, unabashed view on rejection and obscurity accompanied by this nagging expectation that Llewyn's life might blossom into a success story. But ultimately, that's not what the film is about and it's goal is not to satisfy filmic convention. Inside Llewyn Davis is very simply, a soulful and beautifully drawn portrait of a man and his music.

Oscar Isaac portrays the titular Llewyn Davis in the latest film from Ethan and Joel Coen: surely creating one of celluloid's most memorable losers. This is a joyfully melancholic film, if that makes any sense. Set in 1961 in Greenwich village in New York, Llewyn walks through a series of Dylan album covers, beautifully rendered in washed out colours, trying and heroically failing in just about everything he does. After his singing partner throws himself off the George Washington bridge  never a good sign  Llewyn tries to strike out with his solo career, hampered by a ginger Tom, a newly pregnant Carey Mulligan and an over-inflated opinion of his own ability. The film charts the fall and continued fall of his travails.

As this is a Coen brother film, will there be larger than life characters involved? You Betcha! In Llewyn Davis there are some fantastic parts: Roland Turner (John Goodman) as an in-turns moribund and then loquacious passenger from hell in a tortuous road trip from New York to Chicago that (brilliantly) fills the middle act of the film; Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake) as the folk-singing duo trying to get on with their music careers; and my own favourite  Troy Nelson (Stark Sands)  as a Forrest Gump-style Army character who is blessed with a great singing voice  "What do you do now?" asks Llewyn, after he has noisily woken him up with breakfast cereal eating, "Plug yourself in?".

Carey Mulligan is, as always, absolutely mesmeric in her role as Jean. A study in pent up rage at life. She is dressed down and dowdy in this role, but still shimmers and is incredibly sexy ("Most of the men come here because they want to f*** her" says the nightclub owner. "I did".) A scene in a park where she furiously confronts Llewyn about the baby is just superb  "Everything you touch turns to s***" she seethes. "You are like King Midas's idiot brother". And Oscar Isaac is also extremely good in the title role, with his big laconic eyes suiting the role perfectly.

The Coen brothers written script is beautifully done, albeit a bit confusing in places via a flashback. It is a crime that this was not nominated for a screenplay award at the Oscars. In fact, in general, I don't know what the Oscar nomination team were thinking with its general dissing of this film. Just two nominations  for sound mixing and cinematography. Shameful.

Given the nature of the story, you might expect that this is not a particularly feel-good film, but it never seems to quite feel as bad as it should be. The comedy is dry and nicely played, with a few laugh out loud moments. And you end up rooting for (albeit, you quickly realise, without hope) for Llewyn, despairing as he makes each devastatingly stupid small decision. (Surely after he records the iconic space epic "Please Mr Kennedy" with Timberlake and comically bass voiced Al Cody (Adam Driver) a hit and fortune must surely be on the cards?).

In summary, if you like folk music and the pre-Dylan roots of 60's folk music I predict you are going to love Inside Llewyn Davis. If you like Coen brothers movies then you'll also love this movie. Put the two together and this would be your 5* film of the year. Personally, I'm in one camp (the latter) but not the other. For me, the (perfectly pleasant) singing sections went on a bit too long. But this was a masterly film, and one that you unpick in your mind long after the lights have come up. For that reason alone it is recommended, provided you have a tolerance for bad language in film (as you might have already guessed from my review).

Don't waste your time! This film is like watching paint dry. It has no plot, no structure, and fails to entertain in any way. The characters are poorly developed, things that take place don't make sense and don't contribute to the telling of a story. It's like "Waiting for Godot" with some music. People who gush about it are, I'm sure, of the same ilk as those who gawked at Ed Wood movies as if they were at the Sistine Chapel. The Cohen's have done some really wonderful stuff in the past. Films that keep the audience entertained and engaged....like Fargo, Brother Where Art Thou, and the Big Lebowski. This is nothing more than a biography of a 60's folk singer and his sorry existence.

Something about Inside Llewyn Davis appealed to me. I saw a few trailers and I was actually really excited about it. I knew it would be quirky, maybe a little bizarre and certainly anything but mainstream. I was okay with that. I know that the Coen Brothers are often an acquired taste but they have an absolutely distinct style that I have enjoyed before. So I suppose my expectations were reasonably high. Simply put, I was let down. The film tries to show us a week in the life of a struggling musician in the Greenwich Village circa 1961. The biggest issue I found with the film is everyone is so damn miserable and unlikable and that especially goes for our main character. How can you care or be intrigued by a guy who is an absolutely selfish deplorable and miserable all the time. Then he visits his close friends who are also selfish, deplorable and miserable and then you get a little folk song here and there. It was extremely disappointing. Its a bizarre little adventure and parts of it were reasonably entertaining but it continually falls apart. The music (which should be the backbone to this film) is haunting and lovely but just when you start to get involved in the music, it ends and there simply isn't enough of it. Why do we invest time into a struggling musician who is a horrible person and hates his own existence? 

There is certainly nothing wrong with the performances in the film. Oscar Isaac is our title character and he does the role well. The character is simply awful and unlikable and he does that well. I really wanted to see him find some redemption and it feels like its moving towards that but then the film ends...in the most sudden and abrupt way I have ever seen. Still Isaac is fine in a poorly written role. Carey Mulligan is also good at being a really awful human being. The entire story of their brief romance and pregnancy is ridiculous and their hateful, spite filled banter makes no sense. Her completely misdirected anger is irritating and her character is literally a bitch. I don't know what they were aiming for with her but she is awful but Mulligan plays that awful person well. Supporting cast are all decent and most of them have very small brief but important roles. Some worth mentioning are Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Ethan Phillips, Robin Bartlett, Adam Driver and Garrett Hedlund. Also honourable mention to those darn cats that he chases all over.

I understand that this is meant heart and soul to be an art-house film and I'm okay with that. But I have a problem with film makers specifically go out of their way to be bizarre, artsy and ambiguous. Sometimes its nice to not have to decipher every single scene in the film. What does the cat mean? What does the music mean? What is the meaning of his life? Its okay to ask these questions but the entire backbone of the film are these ambiguous questions. If you look below at the IMDb threads 99% of them start with "What ___ means..." "Deciphering the cat..." Sometimes that isn't enjoyable. Sometimes you just want an entertaining, nice story. Parts of this show some remnants of being an interesting quirky little comedy but then it quickly falls apart into trying to be deliberately artistic. It is what it is and some people (mostly critics) seem to adore it. I personally think it was a disappointing experience at best. Did not fulfil my expectations. 5.5/10

Because there is no arc to the character--and only a loose and very arbitrary arc to the film, Inside Llewyn Davis is ultimately an empty exercise in black and white photography. (Although it is a great audition tape for Oscar Isaac. If anyone is thinking of remaking Serpico, here's your star.) 

Inspired by a biography ("The Mayor of MacDougal Street") of folk music legend Dave Van Ronk, the screenplay is only a very superficial skim of the scene. And acclaimed music producer T-Bone Burnette is out of his depth in that role for the film.Where he worked with genuine bluegrass artists like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch on O Brother, Where Art Thou, here he's on his own. He doesn't have roots in folk music (he's an LA rocker) and, like the Coen Brothers, is too young to have been part of the early Sixties NY scene depicted here. It leaves him unable to provide any insights into the music or musicians.

The film picks up Davis at a bad point, follows him through several more of them in a very bad week, including a hellish odyssey to wintry Chicago, then stops--as the opening scene is (without explanation) repeated. If the movie had started a month earlier or a year later, the journey would be totally different. (Five years later and he'd be playing with the Lovin' Spoonful.) This can be read strictly as the fault of the screenwriters. You never see Davis at rest and only fleetingly at work. Davis himself is neither a bad person nor a bad musician. He's good looking, audiences are enthusiastic and he's a terrific singer and picker. He's recorded two albums. He's attractive to women. His personal relationships are a little tangled though he has a set of friends who are more than willing to feed and shelter him. But like most musicians at the beginning of their professional careers, he's sleeping on other people's couches and scrambling for gigs and money.

There are a few interesting acting bits by Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Garrett Hedlund and Coen stalwart John Goodman. F. Murray Abraham has some brutally amusing scenes as an imperious club owner. But in the end, it's a frustratingly wasted look at a pivotal point in American music.

I am completely smitten. I have long admired Joel Coen and Ethan Coen  and what they have offered the realm of cinema. I am in love with  "Fargo" still until this day, and they've provided solid efforts on  nearly every outing since. Their newest endeavor that focuses on the  folk scene in 1961 is an absolute dream. Everything from the impeccable  Oscar Isaac to the music that enriches the deepest trenches of the  soul, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is one of the best pictures of the year,  plain and simple. It's the Coen Brothers finest film since "Fargo." 
Our story begins with a folk singer, Llewyn Davis that has continued to  pursue a music career in 1961 despite being penniless and lacking any  real stability. Migrating from couch to couch, we get a deep look into  a character with a dream that just won't die. As he fights for his  chance to share his voice with the world, following an unexpected loss  of his singing partner, Llewyn is hard to love. He makes poor choices  and seems to lack any responsibility in his life. It's a wonderful  creation of a character that offers insight into a changing time in our  history. 
First of all, I can't get the amazing music out of my head. All the  songs used are absolutely brilliant. Oscar Isaac's richly matured tone  is so soothing and authentic; I'm surprised a music company hasn't  nabbed him up to make a record yet. His opening and closing songs are  his, as well as the film's, pivotal moments that encapsulate the  endearing message and theme. "Hang Me, Oh Hang Me" and "Fare Thee Well  (Dink's Song)" are astonishing records that may not just fall into an  Oscar race but a Grammy wouldn't shock me in the least. It has the same  magical effect as "Searching for Sugar Man," two films that seemed to  capture the innocence and culture of a generation that seems lost. In  terms of performance, Isaac is incredible. So raw and genuine, it's one  of the year's finest performances by any actor. He has made himself one  of the most exciting actors to watch in the coming years. This will  lead him into more challenging and accessible roles. This guy could  become one of our finest actors in just five years' time. This is  something that should land him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. It's  very much deserved. 
In their respective but short screen times, John Goodman, Garrett  Hedlund, and Carey Mulligan are all infectious and notable. Goodman  plays a character similar to his "Harling Mays" from Robert Zemeckis'  "Flight" and makes the most out of his appearance. Mulligan is volatile  and I loved every second of her. She brings lots of dark humor and fire  to a role that shows the depth of her abilities as an actress who can  perform impeccably in any genre. We even get her singing again which  had me melt two years ago during her "New York, New York" in Steve  McQueen's "Shame." Hedlund comes and goes but makes his mark as he  often does. 
Justin Timberlake has made a seamless transition from musician to actor  and back to musician. Great in roles like "The Social Network" where  his star power doesn't distract from the story at hand, in a Coen  Brothers film, where he sings (in a very current pop way), he becomes a  bit distracting. I was very aware that Timberlake, probably this  generation's Michael Jackson, was sharing the screen. More than likely  not his fault, it could be a case of being "too big" for your movie. 
One thing that the film has taught mewe need to give Adam Driver more  movie roles. Timberlake, Isaac, and Driver put their marks on one of  the songs "Please Mr. Kennedy," and make it one of the year's most fun  and remarkable numbers. 
Joel and Ethan Coen continue to show their ranges in directing and  writing. Flawlessly executed in character understanding and keeping our  story moving. Llewyn Davis is such a complex and interesting man and  their screenplay gives Isaac room to breathe and explore the subtle  nuances that make his character unique and real. As their alter ego  Roderick Jaynes, the film moves like a smooth monorail, hitting all its  marks and picking up new and exciting quirks along the way. 
An almost silver-green canvas evokes the dark and grey tones of the New  York scene in 1961. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel masterfully  captures the ticks and beats of Isaac as he sings with heartbreaking  emotion and walks through the frigid cold streets. Jess Gonchor's  production design places us all in the folk scene, with intimate bar  settings, old-time music studios, and even the classic feel of a  Greenwich Village apartment building. 
CBS Films has a gem on their hands with "Inside Llewyn Davis." A sure-  fire Oscar contender in several categories including Best Picture. If  there's any justice in the film world, Oscar Isaac would firmly sit  near the top of the finest performances of 2013 in Best Actor and nab  nearly every award he comes in contact with. "Inside Llewyn Davis" is  sensational and an instant classic to be remembered.
