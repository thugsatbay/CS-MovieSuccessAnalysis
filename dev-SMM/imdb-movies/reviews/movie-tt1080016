### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
My wife and I attended an early press screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).

This time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they're dinosaur eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid, it's up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross in order to rescue Sid.

Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting, the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there's actually a very cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.

To sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that'll appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10.

Ice age 3 was really funny and it stays true to the series. Same old characters, a whole new adventure that everyone at any age can enjoy.

I saw the critics and I thought to my self that it would be good, but I didn't expect much, but I really did enjoy it more than I thought. It may not be the best compared to the other Ice Age films, but it still a great thrill ride that the audience can enjoy.

And if you find a theater near you that has it in digital 3D, go and watch it in 3D, because the action and adventure will excite you even more than it actually does.

Normally people think since it's a third part, then the movie won't be that great, but hear me when I say that keep that thought out of your mind and parents, take your kids with you, they are sure to leave with a smile and a long lasting excitement for more.

100% enjoyable, its a 10!

I haven't had so many laff-out-loud moments in a movie for a long time. There's about an even mix of verbal and visual gags in this 3rd installment of the Ice Age family saga, they're all fresh instead of hackneyed, and they all work. You wouldn't think a film set in the age of mammoths would be able to run a parody of the old "red wire vs. blue wire" time-bomb scenario, but they find an ingenious way to do it.

Now those among you who haven't fallen prey to creationism are well aware that mammoths are very large mammals (and hence quite recent in geological time), while the last of the dinosaurs went extinct 65,000,000 years ago. So how does the plot explain their coexistence? Well, it seems that there's this entire hidden tropical world underneath the eponymous ice, and our heroes literally fall into it. (Don't overthink it.)

Suddenly Manny the mammoth and his pregnant mate Ellie discover that they're not only not the largest creatures on Earth, as they'd thot, but actually pretty petite compared to the Mama T. Rex, who in turn has to look up to Dad. It's a classic tale of nature red in tooth and claw, except for nobody actually getting eaten. (Well, several critters are swallowed whole but subsequently disgorged, slimy with saliva but basically unhurt; family film, y'know.)

The animation is terrific. Judging from the end credits, apparently the Astor beaver trade, long thot to be extinct, has experienced a renaissance in the animated-fur factories of California. Dino babies and mammal kids are ridiculously endearing. The 3-D is likewise terrific, well used where appropriate (especially in conveying a sense of scale for the underworld) but not overdone. The one carp I have is that 3-D simply does not lend itself to dissolves between scenes; I'm guessing the filmmakers figured this out themselves, as most of the time they used cuts.

The characters, familiar now from the 2 previous films, are well acted with distinctive personalities, and the comic-relief possums have an expanded role. New to the cast is Scratte, a long-lashed female squirrel who, in a running subplot (including mini-cartoons to both start and end the flik), vies with the iconic acorn for the undying devotion of Scrat. As a devotee of the tango, I particularly appreciated their version of it. Also new is Buck, a bold, intrepid, 1-eyed buccaneer of a weasel, voiced by Simon Pegg with British accent in full flower.

Really, it's amazing to realize how much stuff they managed to cram into barely an hour and a half. Never a dull moment, never a missed step. Why, then, does it not get my top rating? Not at all because, as a comedy, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. After all, Dogma was a comedy, and it maxed out on my rating scale. But Ice Age 3 wasn't quite an entire story, more a collection of loosely related parts. Every one of those parts was well done, tho; indeed, I'd gladly take any of them over the entire 2.5 hours of the noxious Transformers; sadly, this much better film probably won't do nearly as well at the box office. Too bad.

OK big plus here - this film is better than the 2nd which i didn't particularly like and if you can go and see it in 3D (For the people who criticise this "gimmick" go and try it 1st rather than base your opinion on other "critics" opinions) do so as it is excellent and really beats the years earlier examples of 3D films (although i didn't see Coraline at the cinema so cant comment on a comparison).

The person who didn't laugh - go on ebay and find a sense of humor - the whole cinema was laughing through out the film and i really enjoyed the jokes - yes you saw most of them coming but hey its a kids cartoon.

The story is easy to follow and again those people moaning its not real jeez ITS A KIDS CARTOON - when do they need to make sense or be realistic..............???

Every kid i have spoken to loves it.

It does have one problem that it is pretty much instantly forgettable along with most the other sequels out at the moment but for the 1hr30mins it was all good fun and a nice way to spend a sat/Friday evening with the Mrs and kids. 

Not gonna win any Oscars for originality but could take the gong for best CGI very very good job if you also consider the back drop and how well it works in 3D.

Ah and how can i forget Scrat - in typical Mr Bean style he returns and does not disappoint, come on guys give the mouse/rat thing his own movie!

Not a bad flick. I don't remember liking the first one, skipped the second one and the only reason I went to see this one was because it was a "sneak preview" that started right after the movie I had gone to see and it was in 3D. I recommend seeing this one in 3D as it was worth the extra couple dollars. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story was really stupid and didn't make any sense (dinosaurs living under the ice???), but it kept me interested the entire movie, partly because of the hilarious side story with the acorn loving animal and an excellent job by Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel(I just got done watching his TV show "Spaced" so maybe I am a little partial), who I had no idea was going to be in the movie. This movie also did a wonderful job of keeping everyone in the audience interested. The theater was packed and the only things you heard besides the movie was popcorn chomping and laughter, lots of laughter. Definitely worth seeing at the theater.

I saw this film earlier today, since it was a sneak preview, and I must say, it was fabulous! When I first heard about the sneak preview, I actually had some doubts about whether to go or not. I recently went to a sneak preview of the proposal, which wasn't half bad, but the theater wasn't even half full!!! when i got into this one, all but the fist two rows were completely full! Still i got a great seat. As for the movie, it was great. All the characters had their fair share of laughs, and they all were equally great! The story revolves around change: Manny and Ellie are together, she is pregnant, Diego wants to move on, and Sid wants to belong and have a family. In order to attain his goal, he goes to look for some friends, but falls through a sheet of ice in the process. He then sees three eggs which turn out to be dinosaur eggs, and believes that they were abandoned. He takes them, and chaos ensues. I would reveal more of the plot, but that could take hours! It may seem like a thin plot if you haven't seen the movie or read the script, but once you do, you will realize just how dense the storyline really is. The cinematography is spectacular, the pop culture references(past and present) are very creative, and the addition of real d 3D just adds more to the film: it is perhaps the best 3D I've seen! Also, all the characters, as said earlier, are also great, but new additions, such as the dinosaurs, and of course Simon Pegg as Buck, are also very funny. There is also times where some of the jokes from Manny seem like the material that made Ray Romano a household name! However, the tie that binds the movie together is the emphasis on the main theme-family and friendship. There are some very dramatic scenarios that display them throughout the movie, and even allow you to feel like you can relate. Since most triquels like Shrek the Third and Spiderman 3 are considered to be clunkers, this will surely be a breath of fresh air to the sub-genre, and is definitely worthy of being an addition to the Ice Age trilogy. A must see in 3D!!! 9/10

Its all about family in essence. Starting one, keeping one, becoming one, protecting one. A family film about family is always going to ring the right bells (unless Eddie Murphys in it), and this is no exception! It's funny, its sharp, it's clever, and when it wants too will tug on your heart strings. It's everything a great family film should be. It has just as much humour to keep the grown ups happy as it does the kids.

It's not perfect; it starts fairly slowly with scenes we've already scene twenty times in the trailer, but the further you go into this adventure the more fun you will have.

A fantastic new addition to the franchise is "Buck" (Simon Pegg) a looney tune hermit possum who joins the herd around half way through. When he enters the scene, the whole movie shifts up a gear! Some of the stuff he comes out with will have you rolling in the isle! If you have the chance, you must see it in 3D! It's amazing how this new version of such an old and dated technology can suck you even deeper into a film! The chases are more exciting, the locations more real, it works so well! And it doesn't give you a migraine!

Overall - Like a franchise should, Ice Age gets better and better and better! If you liked the first, you'll love the second! If you loved the second, you'll go crazy for the third! 2D - 8/10 3D - 9/10

Frankly, I was shocked this movie was so good. I mean, sequels aren't supposed to this entertaining, are they? This Ice Age series - three films, so far - just keeps getting better and better, funnier and funnier.

I think the key to their success is discovering what the movie's fans liked and putting those two characters in larger roles. I am speaking of "Sid The Sloth," who is always hilarious and voiced magnificently by John Leguizamo. "Sid" has more lines in this movie than the other two, I would venture to say.....and that's fine with me and most other folks.

The other "character" is "Skrat," the squirrel, who is joined by a female squirrel. "Skrat" has the hots for her, but she's still no competition when it comes to the elusive acorn. Nothing is more important than holding onto one of those and both squirrels are very funny in their battles for possession of that acorn.

As for the story, just picture Sid pretending to be a mom to a threesome of baby dinosaurs. That's all you need to know - it's pretty wild. In all, this is an extremely funny film which also looks, as the other two did, fabulous on Blu-Ray.

--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--

Personally, I didn't like the second "Ice Age" movie that much. I thought it just wasn't original enough, and couldn't make an impact compared to the great original. So, since movies franchises often have the tendency to get worse with each sequel, I wasn't expecting very much of the third Ice Age movie "Dawn of the Dinosaurs". But, I have to admit, it was quite entertaining and funny, with many jokes and funny situations. The change of location from the white ice world, the main characters inhabited in the first two films, to the lush and green jungle, also did the movie some good, because the optic is just different and more exciting. While the first Ice Age movie still remains unreached by either of the sequels, the third one considerably improves on the second one, with more humor, better action and interesting ideas.        

Manfred and Ellie, the two mammoths, are expecting a baby, and Manfred, who is really happy to become a father tries everything to make his wife more comfortable and happy. Meanwhile, the saber-toothed tiger Diego, has to deal with the fact, that he is not the youngest anymore, and that his instincts and reflexes are getting worse. He decides to leave his herd, because he feels his life is coming to an end. Sid, the sloth, wants to have children of his own, and when he discovers three abandoned eggs in a cave, he decides to take them with him. One morning, he realizes that three dinosaurs have hatched from the eggs, and to make matters worse their mother is already looking for them. She attacks Sid and her three babies and abducts them to her world, a large, lush and green jungle, that is located directly under the thick layer of ice. Manfred, Ellie, the two opossums Crash and Eddie, decide to save Sid and eventually meet up with Diego on the way again. They are then joined by the mad wannabe pirate Buck, a weasel, who lost his eye to a gigantic monster, named Rudy, that lives somewhere deep in the jungle. Sid, meanwhile, tries to convince the dinosaurs' mother, that he can provide more for the children than her, but eventually has to accept that children belong to their real mother. The squirrel Scrat, once again reunited with his precious nut, has to deal with an entirely new problem. A femme fatal squirrel, who uses her charm to take Scrat's nut away from him. Being a lot smarter and trickier than him, she gets to keep the nut for most of the time, but eventually falls in love with Scrat, after he saves her from deadly lava. But what is more important to Scrat, his nut or his new girlfriend?

With so many animated movies flooding the market these days, it becomes quite hard to come up with new ideas. Talking animals certainly isn't one, but if the characters have enough history and emotion, it really doesn't matter. "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" really profits from a slightly new approach to the material, which includes some very obvious parodies. The new character of Buck was most definitely inspired by Jack Sparrow from "Pirates of the Caribbean" and the final battle could have directly come from one of the "Star Wars" movies. Then we have the dinosaurs, who are, of course, extremely evil and always hunt down the main characters. All in all, the movies appears slightly stretched and has some relatively slow bits, for which the beginning and ending compensate, though. Especially the first 20-25 minutes, are some of the funniest in any Ice Age movie. And the scenes involving Scrat and his new girlfriend are just as funny as they have always been.

Then we have once again, the actors who give the characters their voices. Ray Romano, who has such a unique voice, speaks Manfred, Denis Leary is Diego, John Leguizamo is Sid and Queen Latifah is Ellie. Buck, the pirate, is voiced by British actor Simon Pegg. Animated movies can never be judged according to acting, because the true leading actors here are the animators. But just as we are used to, the previously mentioned actors put their best effort into providing their character's voice.

So, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is entertaining and enjoyable, but certainly not the best animated movie of the year. Still it is a good 90 minute time filler, and those who enjoyed the previous Ice Age films, will definitely also like this one. (3.5/5)

The third installment in the Ice Age movie franchise is funny and entertaining, with some very original ideas, but certain lengths throughout the entire film.

Manny is anxious with the pregnancy of Ellie and builds a playground for the offspring. Meanwhile, Scrat disputes an acorn with the female Scratte and they fall in love with each other while Diego feels old since he is unable to catch a gazelle. The lonely Sid feels jealous of Manny and Ellie and when he finds three dinosaur eggs in an underground cave, he steals and brings them to the surface. He hatches the eggs during the night and on the next morning, three dinosaur babies believe that Sid is their mother and follow him everywhere. 

Meanwhile, the real dinosaur mammy seeks their offspring out and when she finds the trio, she brings them back with Sid to her underground world. Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie pursue the dinosaur to rescue their friend and stumble with a dangerous underground world. But they are helped by the smart and talkative one-eyed weasel known as Buck that wears a patch and chases the dangerous Rudy, who was the responsible for the loss of his eye.

"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is a wonderful and entertaining tale of love and friendship, with adorable characters and witty situations. The love of Manny with Ellie is very beautiful; the triangle of love among Scrat, the acorn and Scratte is hilarious; the love of Sid with the three dinosaurs is funny and also heartbreaking. For me, the best scene in the story is when mammy dinosaur brings the three babies to the top of a tree and Sid is unable to climb it and says goodnight to the children. But maybe the most important is the friendship Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie with Sid, risking their lives to save their friend. My vote is nine.

Many reviewers have stated that if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one and worship the third one. Not so. The original Ice Age told a genuine and well-crafted tale, and remains the only compelling film of the trilogy. The sequel, Meltdown, delved into nonsensical antics with little to no plot support. Alas, the third film follows a predictable storyline (mammoth has baby during critical moment; mother dinosaur arrives on cue) but manages to surmount the tired babble by way of a subterranean twist. Oh, yes, beneath the icy tundra is a hidden tropical paradise, home to prehistoric beasts long thought to be extinct. Twilight of the Dinosaurs would be more accurate. If you're looking for alliteration, then perhaps Twilight of the Pterodactyls would work.

This change of scenery opens up a whole new can of worms. Dawn of the Dinosaurs benefits from impressive cinematic sequences not witnessed in previous installments. The coolest sequence involves Buck, the legendary weasel, and Rudy, an albino baryonyx. The two warriors engage in an epic battle on the 'edge of oblivion' (during a storm above the jungle canopy). This provides an explanation for Buck's eye patch, which I initially thought may have been a phony garb. The fighter jet pterodactyls were also impressive.

Buck (short for Buckminster) is a compelling figure that stands out amongst an increasingly banal cast. Diego yearns for his previous life of predation and feels he's losing his edge. Manny has transformed into a cuddly giant, much the same as Shrek did. And Scrat is having trouble choosing between his love for the acorn and his love for an infuriating red squirrel-rat named Scratte. Sid the sloth and the possum twins are the only characters who retain their personality.

I think I'll take a break from animation for a while.

6 hours ago,I went to the movies to catch the 4:40 showing of 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' with my older sister and her boyfriend.I liked the first movie but I haven't seen the second,but that didn't stop me from wanting to see the 3rd installment in the popular series.Boy,am I glad that I spent money and 94 minutes of my life by seeing this.The movie was packed with humor,action,adventure,interesting characters,and even some heart.There are many relationships between characters in this movie that help it from melting.Manny and Ellie are 2 happy woolly mammoths who are expecting a baby.Scrat,the squirrel who continues on his hunt for acorns,meets a female squirrel named Scratee(Scrah-tay),and falls for her.Sid becomes a parent when he discovers 3 eggs underground.In short,I loved this movie.

This is the third movie in the highly enjoyed Ice Age trilogy and after the fantastic first one and sadly slightly lackluster second movie, my reactions when I heard of this movie was that of not caring. But when I had seen everything else at the cinema I went, and I must say this movie was pretty entertaining. Its plot, while predictable kept me entertained and the character's were kept true to their usual self's.

Some negative movies though is the humour it resorts to if a scene starts to drag on a little and this film we saw a lot of the same humour used in 100 films before it but only a small fraction of the films jokes were taken up with this and mostly the film kept original.

Overall, I think I enjoyed the movie more then the second one, but the second one had this bit for style and grace. I will give this movie 52%.

I'm a fan of the Ice Age movies and I think they're quite funny to watch and it's one for kids and adults but is a trilogy always a good idea? After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.

The animation is simply brilliant and very well done and the characters are funnier too, especially the little clips of Scrat and Scratte fighting over the acorn. The story in the movie was very good for a kids' movie and adults can be assured that they will like it too. The jokes were quite funny and there were some sneaky jokes in there for adults but children wouldn't probably see it. Also the one-liners in the movie are pretty funny too, such as when Manny says to Sid, "Don't worry, you'll meet a nice girl with low standards". The cast who lend their voices for our heroes were great too, especially Simon Pegg as Buck who added a bit more of comedy to the movie.

Overall, I would say that this is better than the second movie but not the first. It's a great watch for kids and adults alike and is sure not to disappoint.

Again, please watch the first two parts of the series, Ice Age and Ice Age: The Meltdown. For two reasons: 1. It's just not justified watching a sequel if you haven't seen the earlier parts. 2. This part is not as great as the first two. -- Okay, now Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. First of all, don't go for the 3D version, pure waste of money. As for the movie, one word: disappointment. I have got to stop expecting more from the sequels from now, but can't help it; promos they make, raise your hopes! Ice Age 1 and 2 were these super hilarious, and no exaggeration there, movies that made you laugh your lungs out! I hope I could say the same for Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. I feel the recent trend is to add an unnecessary Emotional-Angle to the sequels, despite what genre the prequels belonged to. I'm talking about something what you got to see in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Terminator Salvation, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and now, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs did not have more than two or three laugh-out-loud moments. The makers of the movie should keep this thing in mind, why the prequels became hit? Ice Age series was supposed to be an out-and-out comedy series, but thanks to this sequel, it isn't anymore. I can't remember one exceptional scene or moment in the movie that I should mention here. But if we take into account the first two parts, I can make a whole list of awesome scenes. Rest, you can look forward to some good wit from Diego and Manfred, and yeah, Sid, Crash and Eddie are awesome as usual. Anyway, I'd suggest you watch it at a not-so-expensive theater, since going at an upscale one or buying DVD will not be worth it. Or you can just wait for the DVDrip torrent to come out. Honestly, I felt bad writing about Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs like this.

Isn't it quite amusing that seven years ago, the creators of "Ice Age" declared that there would be no dinosaurs in their saga? In a way, that was false right from the start. Remember, there was a dinosaur frozen in ice in the first movie, two prehistoric marine animals let loose in the second, and now here we are, and a tyrannosaurus rex is stomping around having left a subterranean underground prehistoric world in search of her eggs. The idea of reusing the old underground prehistoric world and incorporating it with the Ice Age saga is enough evidence to tell that the filmmakers are running out of ideas. The animation is still top-notch, the voice-acting is great, and the intentions are still good, but the charm and wit and magic that made the first two movies so much fun has withered away and what we are left with is a cheap thirty-minute cartoon expanded into a feature-length movie. "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is a movie made strictly for profit and not for entertainment. It's not really a bad movie, but unlike its two predecessors, it's completely forgettable.

In the third installment in this once wonderful series, Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting a baby. Sid, a little jealous and feeling left out, stumbles upon three dinosaurs eggs in a frozen underground cave and, being Sid, thinks he has what it takes to raise them. The eggs hatch into three baby dinosaurs and then, just as you'd expect, mama arrives, takes her brood and snatches up Sid as well. And then its up to Manny, Ellie, her possum brothers, and Diego to go and rescue him in an underground world where dinosaurs still live. As they search, they are guided by a cocky and pretentiously goofy possum who is like a cross between Captain Ahab and the explorer Frank Buck.

There is nothing wrong with the movie visually. But where it really counts, in the story and characters, it's crippled. The movie is composed of dialogue that is one hundred percent deliberately chirpy and ostentatious, with the filmmakers expecting you to believe that just because they're telling a joke, that you will laugh. The humor in this movie is the same kind you will find in any half-hour cartoon and maybe even a little less profound. Only the character of Buck, the possum, really contains the magic and wit that made the first two movies so much fun.

As for everybody else, they are either watered down or pushed a few too many steps ahead. For instance, I liked Manny when he was a moody mammoth, but I don't like him so much now that he's a happy, jolly guy like Santa Claus with fur and a trunk. The whole pregnancy subplot was just publicity and serves no purpose in the story. Crash and Eddie the possums are no longer funnyBuck has all the humorous moments. And Diego's place in the film has completely watered down into basically cameo quality. He has a lot of screen time, but very little character and impact. Again, he has a problem that's eating away at him, but unlike in the first two movies, where the subplot was worked into making sense, here it really just flickers up now and again and never is fully encompassed upon. And worst of all, Sid the sloth, who always acted stupid but was once very funny, has become so ostentatiously dumb that he condescends into becoming irritating for the audience as well as the other characters.

And what about Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel after his acorn? Well, guess what? He's boring now as well. Because the filmmakers came up with the incredibly dreadful idea of having him only chasing his acorn half the time and spending the rest of his time ogling at a female squirrel.

Now the movie is saved from being a total disaster by the character of Buck, who was enthusiastically voiced and animated, but he's just a supporting character. What made the first two movies so much fun? Whole casts of good characters, effective moments of humor and wit, developed stories, and a certain level of charm. All of that is gone in "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs." This time the filmmakers decided to focus appeal strictly upon the very young members of the audience and forget all the techniques and imaginative works that made the first two films so enjoyable. In the end, "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is, in a single word, forgettable. This should have been a straight-to-DVD production. It's not worth a theater ticket.

A meltdown couldn't stop the "Ice Age" crew the last time so now the filmmakers are upping the ante with dinosaurs. Does it make sense? No. If this third film in the series does as well as the first two, will Manny, Sid, and Diego next contend with aliens? I wouldn't put it past them. Heck, the only thing that's really supposed to make sense here is that these movies are trying to capitalize on a hit franchise. ("Dawn of the Dinosaurs" even more so as it rolls into theaters in not just 2-D but 3-D as well.) Just much like the third "Shrek", this is a forgettable and hollow installment, fine for kids but sure to have older fans of the series checking their watches.

The characters are all back. Manny Mammoth (Ray Romano) anxiously awaits the birth of his first child with Ellie (Queen Latifah). Diego the saber-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) sees his skills as a hunter being diminished and ponders leaving the herd. And Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) feels like the odd man out and wishes for a family of his own. When he finds dinosaur eggs, Sid is determined to raise them as his own, not thinking that mama dinosaur is close by. She tracks Sid down and takes her eggs and him back to her underground valley habitat where dinosaurs and other animals live. One of them is a one-eyed, dinosaur-hunting weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg), who helps Manny, Diego, Ellie, and Ellie's possum brothers (Sean William Scott, Josh Peck) when they go looking for Sid.

Scrat the squirrel stars too, still trying to obtain that acorn. Usually his slapstick segments are some of the best parts of the film but even he is little more than lightly amusing. Scratte, a female squirrel, hinders his efforts this time and also serves as romantic counterpart but since neither talk and both seem to like the acorn more than each other, who cares. The same goes for the rest of the movie. The physical comedy gags are too far between and all that's left is a lot of outlandish personalities, most of which are more annoying than funny.

Plotting is limited, stretching the importance of family while at the same time doing nothing of any interest. Splitting the team up takes away from the fun, too many secondary characters only serve as a distraction, and the perils, which include plants, a large dino named Rudy, and floating lava will thrill the kids but be too dull for parents. This puts a damper on the 3-D animation as well, which has some nice snow and forest-filled landscapes but nothing that, figuratively, jumps off the screen about the characters or action.

The vocal actors are still matched up well, just they get very few actual funny things to say. Leguizamo's slurring, goofy performance as Sid is the most fun. Romano is well matched with the cautious, nasally Manny, as is Leary to the vicious Diego. And Latifah is sassy as Ellie. Simon Pegg gives the movie some life as Buck, a nutty safari-hunter who loves the thrill of the chase.

But we're a long way from the visual feast and energetic fun of "Up". I'm sure the kids won't seem to mind though. "Dawn of the Dinosaurs" exists for them. It's just too bad parents are forced to shell out big bucks for something that would have been just as good for cheap had it gone directly to DVD.

I have walked out on a handful of movies in my life. Ice Age 3 joins that handful. For the first 45 minutes of the film the plot meanders along aimlessly. The characters all act like self-centered boneheads, and un-comedic shenanigans feebly result.

I'm serious. I love digital animation. I love 3-d. But I realized while watching this movie that neither of those things can save a rancid stinker of a script. The only interesting aspect at all of the movie was the sabre-toothed squirrel and his acorn gag, which by the way can be seen in its entirety in the preview and was not new in any way.

My fiancée turned to me at one point during the movie and said "it's in 3-d, isn't it?" The effect was so watered-down that we could no longer tell. Plus, there was no aspect of the story which caught our interest whatsoever.

Good animated comedies are funny to the adults in their audience as well as their kids. Dozens of digitally-animated movies succeed wildly in that respect. But what we've got here is proof positive that someone will finally spend the millions of dollars it takes to put an absolute turd on the screen using the latest technology.

Basically this should be the last Ice Age, but it won't. The characters have been reduced to stereotypes of their previous personalities, nothing feels at stake in this movie, the best moments are in the trailer, and plot has been sacrificed to showcase the vaunted 3D animation. Jaws 3 did the same thing, except I cared enough to see the next person get eaten. This didn't make me care in the slightest.

There is an overabundance of Scrat in this movie as well. Out of the 90ish minutes, I figure a good 45 of it showed Scrat in some fashion. To me, Scrat should be an amusing side show, not a centerpiece.

In hindsight, I'm not sure why I bothered to go see this. At least I know now this will be my last foray into the "Ice Age." Skip this terrible movie entirely and save your money and your time.

I really loved Ice Age 3, I find dinosaurs very cool and that is was makes this a 4, then the movie grasps the concept of family, having one, losing one and sharing one, then making one that pushes it to a 7. The movie also felt more well done than the first second and fourth, fourth was the worst.

Modeling of mommy dinosaur or Momzilla and the babies was very well done, the movie has the best adult humor in it out of the whole series and Ice Age 3 would be a movie for even adults to watch.

Buck was the best "new" addition to the herd, until he left for Rudy at the end. He was hilarious like this:

Manny: Look when exactly did you loose your mind? Buck: Hmm, three months ago, I woke up one morning married to a pineapple... AN UGLY PINEAPPLE... *sigh* But I loved her.

That was funny as hell, and the Chasm of Death part was funny. Buck pushed it to a 8.

And some of the scenes were kind of sad, like the farewell of the Dino-babies and Momzilla and the scene just before the eggs hatched. (You can see the babies in the eggs from the sunlight and Sid holding them and his shadow looks like a woman rubbing here tummy when she was pregnant) That pushes it to a 9.

Overall, the movie was EXCELLENT, in my top 10, it grasped the concept of family, had cute baby dinosaurs, had dinosaurs in it, had a beautiful jungle under all of that ice.

Good job Mike Thurmeier, I hope you direct Ice Age 5 yourself and bring the Momzilla back and the babies and Buck, it will be the either the new first best or second best Ice Age Movie!

Great for kids and not really adults (unless you like talking mammoths, sloths and saber-tooth tigers!) I think the producers of Ice Age have really reached the limit of sequels you can make out of the materials they had (the weird miss-matched group of Manny, Ellie Sid, Scrat and now Scratte (plus the eggs). Ice age 1: Fantastic! Ice Age 2: Good but getting a little old. Ice Age 3: Yeah, OK enough now! Some movies aren't meant to have tonnes of sequels, and I think that they've reached their limit. I can't even remember what number 2 was about for crying out loud! My suggestion: Watch number one and leave it there! If you want to watch the rest go for it - but don't be disappointed if they're not what you expect.

Ice Age 3:Dawn of the Dinosaurs isn't a bad film, far from it, but it is my least favourite of the Ice Age films. Granted, the animation is absolutely wonderful as it was with the first two, and the music is nicely composed. The characters are likable enough, I have always love Scrat he is so funny, and the voice acting is very good. However, the script and jokes aren't quite as good this time around. There are some good moments, but some of the writing is lacking and there is the odd lame visual gag. Also this is the Ice Age film with the I feel most predictable and most unevenly paced story. There are some scenes that are rather derivative and the pacing either feels rushed and lagging, it never quite feels just right. All in all, it was okay, but it never wowed me as such. 6/10 Bethany Cox

This film is about the Sid bringing home three dinosaur eggs in order to start his own family that he longs for.

The animation in "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" is very good. The initial scenes which Sid finds the eggs are impressive, as the shadows and the amount of light on the eggs changes when Sid moves. The scene where an animal falls into water looks actually perfectly real and not animated.

However, the content of the film was a major bore. The same supposedly funny material keep coming up, as if the filmmakers ran out of jokes. I got so tired of squirrels chasing nuts and animals falling from height. The jokes may be entertaining if you do it once, but not when repeated thirty times. In addition, most of the entertainment is geared towards young children, which means there is not enough material to keep adults interested.

I find "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" tiresome and boring. I was waiting for it to end about half way through already.

What is happening to Hollywood movies?! It seems like in the last 10 years or so they've been so busy rushing through scripts to select the ones that tick all the target audience quota, that they have forgotten what it means to make a good movie. And this pile of garbage holds true to that mushy "American family" feel they try to regurgitate over and over and over again. Making way too many direct and obvious references to the lives humans lead. Now yes it may be a movie ultimately aimed at children but I for one really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd movies. They were well written, incredibly funny and top-notch on design. This however, is just cheesy punchline after cheesy moment after cheesy character. There were far too many jokes referenced to snot and other 'gruesome' mucus-y type fluids, which were way over-used and overrated as a gag. Also, some of the dialogue was just plain mean and questionably perverse. Like the lines "Why are we saving Sid? I don't even like Sid, no one does, hes an idiot hahahaha" and "I dunno why everyone says 'I've got your back', all the best bits are in the front".

All in all, the movie lacked any real substance, the characters were old and bland and the whole thing just ended up being yet another Hollywood movie out to make a quick buck, which will be forgotten in the weeks after its taken off cinema.

What a waste of talent on the animators' parts...

This movie agitated me. Yes, I know its for young kids, but the script was annoying. The Ice Age series should be extinct now. Yes the first one was good, but they have stretched this concept too far. Queen Latifah's character was annoying and the lines were so cliché of kids movies.

There's not much more to say about it. The movie was definitely the worst out of the three. The movie is boring and story line is predictable and is quite lame. Watch Wall-E and compare, this Ice Age isn't even close.

Ice Age needs to be extinct.
