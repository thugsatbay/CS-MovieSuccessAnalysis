### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Here's a surprise: The Gift is a mature thriller that's more complex and classy than the trailers suggest. I don't know what caused the marketing department to make the film look like such a second-rate, cheap, predictable thriller that somehow had gotten ahold of talented actors, but now we know the truth. As Joel Edgerton's directorial debut, it's impressive, considering the sense of craft going on behind the camera. The cinematography is gorgeous and the pacing is that of a slow burn, but it's never dull. The premise is also deceptively simple, turning more intricate and involving as the film progresses.

Edgerton, who also wrote the screenplay, refuses to adhere to genre conventions, constantly subverting audience's expectations on how the story plays out. Red herrings, plot twists, shifting perspectives, and moral ambiguity ensue, but they never feel cheap. Like the best thrillers, The Gift evolves naturally and realistically. Edgerton and Rebecca Hall are great, but it is Jason Bateman who impresses. As a natural comedian actor, he plays one of his rare, serious roles to terrific effect. But I digress. You should go into this film with a clean slate, but know that it is a rare, intelligent thriller that doesn't cheat or spoonfeed its audience. And in that regard, Joel Edgerton has given us a gift, indeed.

The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton. It stars Joel Edgerton, once again, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall.

The Gift surrounds a married couple(Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall) as they transition into a new job, new house, new neighbors, new friends, basically a new life. As they shop for furniture Simon(Jason Bateman) encounters an old acquaintance from High school, Gordon or Gordo(Joel Edgerton), with a creepy demeanor and an obvious grudge.

The Gift is Hitchcockian. I can't call it anything it isn't. I went into this movie with medium expectations and left with a newfound respect and awe for one person. This person is Joel Edgerton. As a director, he can't do wrong. The shots were inspired and eerie. He cut at just the right times to ensure the audience is terrified but not disgusted. As a writer, he can't do wrong. This is honestly one of the best scripts of the year and I hope it gets an Oscar nomination. It was so well written. The major player in both the direction and the writing is that no serious violence was portrayed in any scene in this movie but yet it manages to crawl under your skin and linger long after the movie's over. This is partly thanks to the excellent cinematography by Eduard Grau. Finally as an actor, CAN'T DO WRONG! He was creepy as hell but yet you some how want to root for him. He plays the role magically and was by far the best part of this movie. 

Jason Bateman, oh how woefully I doubted you. At first I didn't think he could pull it off. But he did. He was perfect as well. he was sly and slimy as well as awkwardly funny and relatable ( before everything goes down). Rebecca Hall in many ways was the main character. She did great. Though she wasn't as good as Edgerton or Bateman, she certainly held her own. Another great aspect of the movie was the soundtrack and the score. It fit perfectly to the subtly creepy atmosphere. Finally Since the script was so well written the viewer is left in ambiguity towards the morals of a character and I find this masterfully executed with every twist and turn being virtually unpredictable.

All and all I loved this movie. Some might argue that the pacing is a bit off nut with such a short runtime. Certain things are justifiably stretched our skimmed. personally I didn't find this much of a problem. The Gift IS my favorite movie of the year so far and is a must see. The Gift gets an A+ or a 10/10. Simon says go watch this movie!

The only more underserved genre for moviegoers besides serious adult comedies/dramas or immersing fantasies are the classic thriller. The last truly marvelous, slick thriller that graced multiplexes nationwide was "Prisoners," an unnerving mystery revolving around the kidnapping of two young girls, with one father going to desperate lengths to find them. Since then, marginally passable films like "No Good Deed" have stumbled into theaters but never left the kind of imprint on audiences that has them genuinely consumed with fear and uncertainty thanks to the slickness of a film.

Joel Edgerton's directorial debut "The Gift" is the first thriller that will leave an imprint on its viewers in a long time for more reasons than its rich cinematography and expertly paced narrative. It's the kind of film that gets one to look introspectively at the wrongs they've committed, in this case, in school, where perhaps a rumor you helped spread, or even started, went on to scar the victim for life. Perhaps if you helped spread said rumor, you've moved on, but what if the person you hurt hasn't forgotten the pain and torment your little white lie caused? 

"The Gift" examines the idea of an unburied hatchet by focusing on the young married couple of Simon and Robyn (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall). They've just moved into a beautiful, spacious home, with Simon finding tremendous success with the company he works for and Robyn coming to terms with her anxiety and her addiction to prescription medication. Hoping to start life a new, they are thrown for a loop when they meet a man named Gordon (nicknamed "Gordo," played by Edgerton) at a home-appliance store. Gordo is an old classmate of Simon, who barely recognizes him, yet still, upon even a brief conversation, recalls he's still four tires short of a car.

Gordo repeatedly makes kind, yet invasive gestures towards Simon and Robyn, delivering wine, bringing fishes to fill their small pond out front, and stopping by while Robyn is home alone to keep her company. While Robyn sees a sensitive, somewhat lost soul in Gordo, Simon sees nothing but a creep - a persistent creep that has something to prove or uncover about him that Simon doesn't want revealed. Eventually, when Gordo's actions turn particularly personal and an apology on his part is warranted, Simon and Robyn receive a letter asking for "bygones to be bygones" for something that occurred in the past, to which only Robyn is left clueless.

The performances here are unanimously strong, particularly from Bateman, who gives one of his only very serious roles to date here. Bateman even delivers a powerful monologue before his costar, Hall, who also does some good work as a troubled woman simply wanting peace of mind, concerning the "winners and losers" of America and how people are only held back by personal insecurities and events of the past because they choose to be. His delivery and conviction here is very strong, as he deadlocks his eyes into Hall and digs into her, himself, and everything that occurred in the past in one great scene.

Edgerton, however, has the real challenging role - playing a guy who can look sweet and nimble, almost neighborly, but also a bit off and maybe even a little unstable. Edgerton's blank facial expressions find ways to be amiable, despite his behavior being increasingly troubling, almost too kind, and the character he creates for himself is one you struggle to find exactly what's bad about him when "too nice" doesn't seem to cut it.

Yet Edgerton's craft here is something to really marvel at. Serving as the writer, director, and co-producer, "The Gift" is essentially his playground and, in turn, he creates a thrilling funhouse of Hitchcockian principles and truly absorbing fear. Drenched in dingy, saturated cinematography, casting a moody light on nearly every scene, "The Gift"'s atmosphere (thanks to cinematographer Eduard Grau) is a richly detailed one. The eeriness is very even and understated, and the fright aspect sneaks up on you like the potentially deeper meaning of a kind neighbor's gesture. This is a beautiful film in terms of its look and feel, constantly feeling like its toying with your emotions.

Finally, there's the narrative structure, which is very unlike Hollywood. Unlike more conventional thrillers, like "No Good Deed," "The Gift" doesn't really have that incredulous, explosive moment, where everything you thought wouldn't happen does and the plausibility gets sacrificed for theatrics. Sure, there are some great twists, including one that goes further than I ever expected this film to go, but never is there that one moment where every ostensibly implausible thing occurs that effectively derails the entire project in terms of tone and pacing. "The Gift" remains consistent in creating a feeling of dread, even when the tables turn and the protagonist and antagonist lines are blurred.

At the end of the day, however, Edgerton is the real star here. Proving himself a competent do-all man and not just a gimmicky actor-turned-director, he molds "The Gift" to his liking and asserts himself not only as a strong lover of thrillers and Hitchcockian principles but an actor who can also say, "sit back and watch" when he goes to do something and actually do it correctly.

Why as a seasoned movie addict and theatre visitor am I always amazed at the way the " Blockbusters" get all the press and gossip and fantastic movies like this slip through the net. Like last years immense " The Babadook ", this directional debut by Joel Egerton is a really good thriller and has had nowhere near the media coverage it deserves. It makes me so angry that the Marvel franchise gets rammed down our throats on TV and in fast food cafes and masterpieces slip through the net. Excellently directed and very well acted,this clever little well - wrapped gift is all we need to let us know that the proper movie making process is still alive and kicking. Very few special effects and perfect use of sound( or lack of it in some cases) with 1 or 2 shocks to keep us going,it carries a clear message of our past waiting to wreck our future. I think it cleverly slows pace half way through then wakes up in the last third.Grab it while you can guys cos this will just go after a week or 2.

The Gift follows married couple Simon and Robyn who get a unexpected encounter from Gordo, an acquaintance from Simon's past. At first, Simon doesn't recognize Gordo, but after a troubling series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts, a horrifying secret emerges. Little do they know that their perfect lives are about to be thrown into a terrifying tailspin.

This film standing as Joel Edgerton's directional debut, I must say is pretty impressive. This was a well crafted thriller put together by Edgerton, it wasn't as predictable as most thrillers are these days, it was simply one where our expectations keep getting pummeled to ground from how the story keeps transitioning.

Everyone in this were simply astonishing, Edgerton played such a compelling creepy loner with so much aplomb, Hall played her role perfectly as a depressed woman that can't stress enough with all the fear and for Bateman, coming from his comedic standpoint, simply impressed as the husband with one troubling past. Round of applause to each and everyone!

The film builds an effective sense of suspense and disbelief, you don't know what to believe from all the turn of events. The story was told so fluently with the suspense, is wasn't cheap or hasty but more chilling and grim when it came to the very well paced manner, it doesn't simply spoonfeed us with everything it's doing but really lets us take the turn for worst with each surprise hiding at each corner.

The Gift was simply a shot in the dark when it let loose from the formulaic genre it was hanging off of. This nerve-wracking thriller maturely sends this main couple spiraling out of control as Edgerton simply starts to turn their life upside down by downgrading their relationship piece by piece. You can never tell who's the main protagonist, Is It Bateman? Is it Hall? Is It Edgerton? You can't really seem to tell until the surprise-filled ending that takes a wonderfully warped take on long-ranged karma. The Gift most certainly gave deliberate pacing, believable characters, and masterful understanding of cinematic suspense, Edgerton really proved that this film shouldn't be the last present we receive from him.

'The Gift' is ostensibly about an upper middle-class married couple  Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall)  who are terrorised by a ex-classmate of Simon's named Gordo (Joel Edgerton) looking to settle an old score after their move from Chicago back to the former's Los Angeles' East Side neighbourhood. And yet, Edgerton, who also wrote the screenplay, is not just content for his psychological thriller to be just another B-grade exercise; instead, there are more than a few nasty surprises in store for an audience jaded by such run-of-the-mill genre fare, and it is Edgerton's emphasis on character rather than empty shlock that ultimately pays off in a slow-burn but nevertheless consistently gripping mystery.

As is typical with such narratives, Simon and Robyn start off as the picture of marital bliss who are looking to move on from an episode in the recent past. Simon is starting a new job at a high-profile digital security firm, and Robyn hopes to get back to her passion as a freelance designer  but the cracks are there, especially the relics of a miscarriage. Following a seemingly serendipitous run-at a downtown furniture store, Gordo leaves a housewarming gift at their doorstep, a generosity that Robyn feels obligated to repay by inviting him over for dinner. Thing is, the gifts keep coming, and while Robyn responds by letting him in out of politeness, Simon is slightly more wary of their overly hospitable guest. His displeasure comes to a head after Gordo makes a hasty and prolonged exit no sooner after they arrive at a surprisingly posh two-storey house upon the latter's dinner invitation.

Upon a stern warning to leave them alone, strange things start happening around the house. Robyn gets the nagging sense that Gordo is watching her in the day when she is alone at home, and even starts hallucinating that he is peeping at her in the shower. The disappearance of their family dog one day further cements Simon's suspicion that Gordo hasn't taken too kindly to his admonition. And yet throughout the ensuing unease, Gordo never does appear in person  except in Robyn's daydreams  leaving us wondering if it is all a red herring. Then a letter in Gordo's signature red envelope lands in their mailbox, with a cryptic send-off to Simon to "let bygones be bygones". Simon downplays its significance, but Robyn is convinced that Simon is hiding something.

Whereas the first act was about Gordo playing the typical psycho stalker, Edgerton reserves the second act for unravelling just who Simon is  and as you may expect, the answers are less than savoury. Peeling back the affable charm on Simon's surface, we are led to discover someone else altogether, so much so that we are forced to re-examine our sympathies for the man in the first place, and by extension, our contempt for Gordo's apparent sociopathic behaviour. Edgerton tells the story from Robyn's perspective, not only because she is as much in the dark about the man she married as us, but also for the fact that, as Simon's façade falls apart, she alone becomes the emotional core of the story and the only one we end up rooting for.

Although Robyn's neighbour and Simon's colleagues do pop up for a couple of scenes here and there, this is pretty much a story that stands on just three characters, and Edgerton brings Gordo back in the last act to extract payback from the person whose arrogance and apathy many years ago had set his life on an irreversible downward spiral. There is a sharp lesson here on lies, misdirections and their consequences, and instead of settling for a comfortable ending, Edgerton opts for something much more unnerving that keeps you guessing just what Gordo's motive is all this while. At no point does he settle for conventional thrills, so those expecting a mano- a-mano between Simon and Gordo are bound to be disappointed.

Yet those looking for a fine actors' showcase will be pleasantly surprised, for Edgerton gives plenty of room for each one of his actors to shine  including, we may add, himself. Bateman subverts his Everyman likability as he transforms from a nice guy to a sinister bully that has no qualms ruining other people's lives, and the actor better known for his comedic roles turns in a fine dramatic performance with heft and gravitas. Hall is his perfect complement, playing the part of the kind and vulnerable wife with watchful intelligence and quiet empathy. Edgerton is in great form himself as the creepy loner sociopath, who earns our disgust and pity in equal measure as we discover how much of a sad sack he is and what led him there in the first place.

To use its very own metaphor, 'The Gift' is like a present within a present whose pleasure lies not just in finding out what it truly is but also in the process of unveiling it layer after layer. That may come off as a drag for less patient audiences or those looking for late-night cable movie thrills, but those willing to accept a slow- burn psychological thriller that unfolds at its own measured pace will find much to like about this well-crafted and well-acted package. It is as assured and auspicious a debut for a first-time filmmaker as any, and Edgerton proves to be both smart and savvy as actor-writer- director in getting the best out of his actors as much as getting under his audience's skin.

Billed as a mystery and a thriller, Joel Edgerton's The Gift is indeed both of those and more. The sub genre might be "home invasion" of a figurative and a real kind, reminiscent of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Equally so it's a home horror film, for some of the traditional tropes of that genre are in place (e.g., missing dog, running faucet) waiting around the corner of any room so to speak.

Super security salesman Simon (Jason Bateman) is happily married to interior designer Robyn (Rebecca Hall). Their new LA home is wall to wall windows, all the better for bad forces to look in and to ironically comment on the lack of transparency inside the home as well as a security expert's vulnerability. Then Simon's old high school friend, weirdo Gordo (Joel Edgerton), visits with gifts and memories of a troubled past.

Their home is indeed invaded, not just by nerdy, strange Gordo, who has a bad habit of showing up at odd times and gaining access at even odder ones, but by the past, which is creeping up on the couple despite Simon's will to leave it all behind and Gordo's to "let bygones be bygones." The film bears its tensions well, distributing its exposition of the past in the present slowly.

The Gift doesn't just give the present a chance to come to terms with the past; it also comments on privacy, security, and bullying while serving up a fine stew of ironies and suspense. As for bullying, not the first time in a thriller, it plays out from high school days to adult days in a surprisingly subtle way, forcing us over the long haul of the film's 108 minutes to see it lurking like a clichéd ghost or murderer.

Marriage is also a subject in this taut film, namely how much do we really know about our partners or anyone close to us? This film could make anyone a skeptic about the goodness of your fellow travelers. Speaking of which, Gordo is the outsider, whom writer Flannery O'Connor liked to write about because "he changes things." Gordo is an agent of change, an avenging angel of the past and a messenger for the future.

Smart thriller for late summer.

The 90's was the golden age of highly stylized stalker thrillers with flicks like Basic Instinct, Single White Female and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and the actor-turned-director Joel Edgerton hearkens back to those films with his directorial debut The Gift. In The Gift, young charismatic Simon runs into an old high school acquaintance named Gordon, and after a painfully awkward conversation, they go their separate ways. Simon's wife, Robyn, thinks it's just a chance encounters while Simon wants nothing to do with "Gordo the Weirdo." Gordon then slowly starts inserting himself into their lives and brings to light secrets about Simon's life, and Robyn realizes that she doesn't know who her husband really is. The thing that makes The Gift so unpredictable is the ambiguity of the villain. Initially, we think that Gordon is the villain since we seem him suddenly become too clingy and start stalking the couple, but as the plot progresses, Gordon reveals several secrets about Simon that make Simon seem like the true villain. Each secret revealed about Gordon and Simon twists the plot even further but not so much that it causes the film to meander through its story. This is a very controlled movie. None of the suspense comes from big chase sequences or any real action; it's the revelations about the characters that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Gift is a surprisingly well-crafted and intense thriller film that feels like a throwback to the best 90's stalker flicks.

"You may be done with the past but the past isn't done with you.", one of the many creepy and subtly sinister lines out of Joel Edgerton's brilliant directorial debut. The Gift is the definition of a sleeper hit. It has all the right things going for it, a great cast, a great script and the potential to be a future classic. What starts off as a slow burn thriller, giving the audience enough exposè to make us really connect with these characters and sympathize with every single one of them then slowly turns into a new age Pacific Heights. The film pits Simon and Robyn, two newlyweds that have just bought a house in Simon's hometown. While out shopping, Simon runs into Gordo, a guy from his high school days that is a bit off and at that moment, the film takes off and we're given enough twists and turns to constitute this as shocking to say the least. Actor and, now, director Joel Edgerton knocks this film out of the park, making this a home run for it being his directorial debut. Hell, if this was his tenth film, it'd be a home run. Edgerton directs his screenplay and actors with such confidence, you'd think Adrian Lynn directed it. The three leads in Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton couldn't be more perfect. Bateman delivers a career best performance, ditching his recent string of light comedies and applying his condescending attitude towards the yuppie entitlement in Simon. Rebecca Hall, who has yet to deliver a bad performance in my eyes, makes this no exception. She's fantastic in this film. Joel Edgerton also proves extremely eerie as Gordo and for someone to pull off the perfect trifecta such as Edgerton, it puts him in the same league as Ben Affleck. This is a fantastically twisted potboiler film that needs to be seen. The Gift stands as single handedly the best film of the summer and one of the very best of the year.

Yeah, this was a lot of fun. I mean, the story reminds me of many others (most noticeably, Gone Girl and Side Effects) in that it's able to turn its story in more ways than one. As a very straight- forward thriller (the first half of the film) it works marvelously. Edgerton really has such a confident control of the pacing and the tone he wants the film to have, and when it switched direction, he's still able to keep the audience in their toes. What's most impressive is that this really is such a B-plot in many ways, but Edgerton goes further and really develops a thoughtful morality tale. Just when the film seems like it's going to go down the rabbit hole and not come back, he reveals another aspect of the story that puts it al in perspective. There are a few implausibilities (like someone else said, not sure if I can buy that she would be unaware of how he was for such a long time) but there are enough answers to such questions that are satisfactory and don't damage the film as a whole.

The three leads are also so fantastic. Edgerton is perfect, and Bateman also really surprising. Who knew the lead from Arrested Development (although in retrospect his character never really stayed in caricature mode really) had this in him? He has some really dramatic scenes that blew me away. Rebecca Hall is such a great screen presence so her I'm not surprised about at all. She's just great.

I think what's also really impressive about the film is that nothing comes out of nowhere. Every turn you sort of have an inkling, and you see all of the clues planted early. This may seem like a problem for many ("i totally saw that coming") but for storytelling, it's what works best in retrospect. The film at its core is really about the way our past can have consequences not just for us but for others, and the way it can also shape other people in ways you wouldn't expect. Simple, but effective.

When Simon Callum (Jason Bateman) moves with his wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) from Chicago to an astonishing house in California to work in a new job, they need to go shopping in a store. Out of the blue, a man named Gordon "Gordo" Moseley (Joel Edgerton) stumbles upon Simon and tells that he was a former high school classmate. Gordo overhears their address and brings gifts for the couple, making Simon uncomfortable. Then he invites the couple to have dinner with him and they learn that Gordo lives in a mansion. He receives a phone call and leaves the couple alone at his home and Simon decides to snoop around and mock him. When Gordo returns, Simon says that he should stay away from Robyn and him. There are incidents at Simon's home and the family's dog disappears and Simon blames Gordo. Simon drives to his house and he finds that Gordo does not live there. However the dog returns and the couple receive a letter of apology from Gordo telling to let bygones be bygones. Robyn is curious about the meaning but she gets pregnant. When Robyn discovers that her husband bullied Gordo in high school, she decides to research their past, discovering dreadful secrets from Simon's past. There are many problems with Simon and when the baby is born, he receives a mysterious gift from Gordo. What might be the gift?

"The Gift" is a different thriller where the bad guy is not who the viewer initially imagine. There is tension along the whole story and the conclusion is open. With the resource of DNA, Simon may come up to conclusions about the paternity of his son. But the point is that Gordo and Robyn has always had a civilized relationship and he tells her that good people deserve good things. Therefore, he probably has not raped and harmed her. But this is just an opinion. My vote is seven.

I'll start by saying I really like the 3 main actors in the movie and think they give off good performances. This is a very different role for Bateman and one that I think he does well to play quite convincingly. His wife is brilliant and Joel Edgerton as Gordo the Weirdo is excellent. The slight issue with this movie is the premise is one very similar to that of many films and this movie doesn't really tread that far into new territory. Also while the story and acting is good I don't think the characters are built well enough for us to care that deeply about the outcome. The supposed bad guy isn't bad enough and the good guys aren't really good enough. There are some decent twists and turns but nothing jaw dropping. I did enjoy the film but as you can tell from my review I think it could have been so much more with a few changes to the script and a bit more suspense. However I do recommend you give it a try for yourself as the acting is great and it is still above average for a suspenseful thriller.

There are many times in this movie -- which was scary -- where I was (wrongly) afraid, just like someone yelling "Boo" out of nowhere. There are some plot holes, like wouldn't an Order of Protection (OOP) have worked? For instance, getting a visit,as well as going to the person, are prohibited by an OOP. And also getting an unwanted gift. That would've reduced the movie, much like cell phones would have reduced horror films where calling the cops solves much of the problems (instead of going down to the cellar to see who's there).

Maybe I'm a bit too mechanistic in my solutions to this psychological thriller. I think calling ahead would solve many problems, but who knows. There are some good moments in this film, but I felt manipulated.

I also wonder if some of the few reviews here for "The Gift" are by people paid by the film company. If that's the case, perhaps IMDb.com and its parent company Amazon should/can check the IP address of the submitters, to see if they're related to a film company or their agencies, sort of like what Wikipedia did to get rid of people changing their own pages / rewriting history.

OK how does the ending make any sense?

How exactly did Gordon get even with Simon? Simon loses his wife and job (both do to Simon actions not Gordon's). Gordon wouldn't know that he was losing either of those just that he took away his "family" which Simon already had done since his wife implies she wants a divorce after having the baby. So technically all he has done is take away the son Simon never had. Which Simon now wont have to pay for after the implied divorce thanks to Gordon. 

Gordon gave Simon all the proof Simon needs. The Restraining order, the video of Gordon getting ready to rape his wife and the baby's DNA. If wife didn't sleep with Gordon and would testify to that Gordon goes to jail. So how exactly does that get him even with Simon? Sweet Gordon is in jail for rape, and Simon is still free, he could go have more kids, get another job, get another wife. So how exactly did Gordon get even? Gordon as already shown that he is a loser, does he not think Simon wont go and get even with him? Seriously, he already showed to lose his temper when apologizing. Especially now that he doesn't have to worry about a job, wife, or kids? It would be Open season, on Gordon. I know this is a good movie, to teach those that bully that it can come back to get you, but lets be honest, if your willing to go to all those lengths to get even, you have expect them to come right back at you. The ending makes no sense, unless you want a squeal about how Simon get even with Gordon. Sorry its a decent movie but that's not how the real world works in the ending.

I am 29 years old and it has been a long time since I have seen a really good movie or at least I should say this kind of movie that does not turn out cheesy and how you expect it to. This looked like a Lifetime straight to TV movie when I saw the trailer and I won't lie that is what attracted me because good thrillers do come along but you gotta wait for them sometimes. What I liked most about this movie is that it portrayed it'self as a low budget small studio film but while your are watching it you can clearly see it's not a crappy low budget film at all even though you may not see many fireworks. The director does a good of trying to get inside your head for the entire movie to the point where you just have to piece everything you watched together before you can determine of the film you are watching is even interesting. It seems the director easily keeps your focus with movie by making your brain piece clues together to figure out what, where and why things are happening. Great acting and great directing made this a 10 out of 10 for me. I am not going to spoil anything because I think you will enjoy this movie and not only will you enjoy but it you will be surprised at how much better this movie is than you thought it would be.

I was sure wrong about The Gift. Trailers and advertisements have marketed the film as one of those generic psychological thrillers that may be heavy on plot and dull on characters but this is not what The Gift was. In fact, the characters Simon (Jason Bateman), Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Gordo (Joel Edgerton) are so well crafted from the script, they will still sit in your head hours after watching actor turned director Joel Edgerton's successful debut.

In The Gift, the story is about a man named Simon and his wife Robyn move into a new California home from Chicago and encounter a man named Gordon "Gordo" Mosley from Simon's High School past. Gordo begins to force a friendship on the couple by giving gifts but Simon doesn't want this man in his life because of Gordo's awkwardness and past as a "weirdo" in school. The Gift is essentially about the past. The actions one person did in the past and whether or not one should move on and forget about it. A line is spoken in the film, "Let bygones be bygones". This line or saying that puts itself as the theme of the film. I thought the character of Gordo was excellently played by Joel Edgerton, the director and writer of the film. He turned what could have been a generic stalker-villain caricature and made him a real human being the audience can empathize with. Having said that, the main character Simon can be viewed as a villain himself. 

Of all the movies that released in late July and August 2015, I recommend checking out the Gift. It's a film that cares about a story it wants to tell and characters it feels to explore. No explosions. No spectacle. Just great storytelling.

Time will tell whether Joel Edgerton joins the exclusive club of the famous actors turned talented and successful film directors or sticks to the acting career but his directorial debut, "The Gift", was a nice gift to the fans of the psychological thrillers in the Alfred Hitchcock's fashion or, rather, their new variety, "marriage thrillers" that follow the success of David Fincher's provocative Gone Girl. Edgerton, who gave a bravura performance in the fellow Aussie's, Buz Luhrmann's adaptation of Great Gatsby, hit the trifecta with writing the screenplay, directing, and producing The Gift, and also playing one of the three main characters. 

Edgerton undoubtedly loves the good thriller and proves to know how to make one. The Gift starts with a married couple, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Callen (Rebecca Hall), relocated from Chicago to a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood after Simon finds a new job outside the city that should propel him to the corporate heights. While out buying supplies for their new picture-perfect home, they run into Gordon "Gordo" Moseley (Joel Edgerton), a former high school classmate of Simon's who Simon claims to have completely forgotten about. Soon after, Gordo begins dropping in unannounced, usually when Simon is at work. He sends thoughtful housewarming gifts for the couple, neatly wrapped in the bright paper, with the bow attached, accompanied with nice handwritten card in the red envelope. 

Without giving too much away, it should be said that whatever started as yet another retelling of the "Fatal Attraction" type story, turned out as the dissections of such ugly but persisting realities of life as bullying, human cruelty, unconscious desire for dominating that would start in someone's past and would cover all aspects and spheres of human communicating, including school, family, the workplace, and neighborhood. Main idea of Edgerton's film as shared by director himself during an interview is acknowledgment of one's past, admitting to the wrong doings in order to be able to build the future. But it brings a question: do we change as time goes by? Are we able to admit the guilt that went unpunished and to face the consequences? Can we predict to what extend will our words and deeds affect someone's life? Someone whom we won't even recognize if run across accidentally after many years? 

Edgerton plays with the viewers' expectations and takes them to the unpredictable directions adding to the plot more layers and depths. The way he tells the story while building up the suspense and creating disturbing atmosphere is remarkable. He almost convinces the viewers that they could guess easily what would happen next yet when they expect it the least, he pulls the rug from under their feet. As a director, his use of the multiple glass surfaces is masterful. The heavily windowed houses in the nice South California area, Hollywood Hills, are as important to the plot as three main characters. Huge windows and glass doors seem to bring people closer but, at the same time, they stand as the walls of alienation and estrangement. Massive glass elements soon become gloomy threatening messengers of impending psychological horror which comes from the sins of the past that have not been acknowledged. Danger may lurk behind the misted glass door while you take a shower in the safety of your house. There is a silhouette disappearing in the air in the manner of Keyser Söze behind the thick matt glass doors in the hospital. The movie keeps surprising us by changing the viewpoints, by showing that what we see is not always what actually goes on in front of us. It makes us ask themselves, do we really know these closest to us, someone whom we think we share the intimate knowledge of ultimate closeness with. 

One of the delicious surprises the movie provides is the characters development that drives the story and moves it in the different directions. Both, Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman play real people, complex and alive, not just two-dimensional carton figures. Jason Bateman, especially, impresses by bringing out dark sides of Simon's confident, successful, charismatic persona. But the best gift Edgerton keeps to the very end. For the movie which important and repeated over and over image are nice wrapped gift boxes of the different sizes and shapes, the writer/director refuses to wrap up the ending and attach the colorful bow to it. The Gift's conclusion is open but strangely satisfying. What goes around comes around, and bygones don't want to be bygones.

Greetings again from the darkness. Joel Edgerton has become one of the more interesting actors working today. His projects range from indies like Warrior and Animal Kingdom to award winners like Zero Dark Thirty and big budget releases like The Great Gatsby. He has written screenplays, and now comes his feature length directorial debut  and an impressive debut it is.

Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are seeking a fresh start as they relocate to Los Angeles from Chicago. A new house and new job are an attempt to put an unfortunate situation regarding an unborn child behind them. Things get off to a great start for them as they buy a beautiful house, and Simon is put up for a promotion. An encounter with Gordo (played by Edgerton) leads to some awkward social interactions and some downright creepy stalking.

The film will work best the less you know about it. The psychological thriller aspects never devolve into the slashfest we have come to expect. Instead the film blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys. In fact, it brings into debate what makes a good person  it even states "you may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with you". Do our past misdeeds ever totally fade? What about high school bullies  do they mature? Can the proverbial zebra change its stripes? All of these questions and themes are touched.

While you may struggle to identify the protagonist and antagonist, the performances of both Edgerton and Bateman are fun to watch. And it's Ms. Hall who is the grounding force who initially trusts both men, before questioning everything. There is also a very nice, understated performance from Allison Tolman as an understanding neighbor. Ms. Tolman was terrific in the first year of the "Fargo" series.

Don't allow anyone to tell you much about this before you see it  just know that it will remind you of the importance of the Golden Rule. Treat others how you would like to be treated  or know that bygones are never bygones.

Did I watch the same movie as these other IMDb reviewers? I ask only because The Gift struck me as being a bit of a snore. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with it, but The Gift failed to take off or to shine in my estimation.

The Gift did have a few interesting moments and scenes, but nothing that distinguished it in any real way. Additionally, quite a bit about it seemed to be predictable or capable of being anticipated. I doubt that I'll remember much about this film a few days from now and I don't think that I'll be recommending it to others. See it if you feel compelled to do so. Don't say you weren't warned, though. Meh.

'The Gift' marked Joel Edgerton's directorial debut. He also wrote and starred in the film alongside Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman. For a first time director, this is a very solid, admirable and promising piece of work.

Edgerton's writing is intricate. He interweaves a number of themes together very well while creating a general structure. First of all he uses the premise of the past actions having a huge bearing on the present. The film delves into the theme of bullying and how much of an impact bullying can have on the victim throughout his/her life. Edgerton takes this concept of bullying and merges it with the work culture in the modern corporate world. He shows how people who were once bullies during their school days can continue with their bullying in their professional work to be successful. Edgerton's film is a bit of a damning indictment on corporate culture where these bullies and their bullying get rewarded more often than not. 

When it comes to direction, Edgerton has a great sense of how to use an enclosed location to amplify the tension, because at the heart of it, 'The Gift' is a thriller that thrives on the creation of tension. Edgerton uses the house that Simon and Robyn move in to brilliantly in the tension-filled scenes. I also noticed some subtle use of blocking that he uses. Specially in the kitchen scenes, there is a bit of a rectangular opening in the wall which gets uses quite subtly whenever there is a argument happening between husband and wife. However the moment in the film that stayed with me will be an image that comes very early on in the film. As Robyn and Simon are checking out the different rooms in this new house that they are considering to move into, there is a shot where we see Robyn and Simon facing each other with a glass sliding door separating them. Simon slides open the door and Robyn moves out the door to join Simon oh his side and walks off. This moment in a thematic sense, is a foreshadow for the whole film and it's a brilliant moment.

The acting is also very good. For me the best performance in the film comes from Rebecca Hall. She shows the right amount of grace, likability and vulnerability to portray the character of Robyn and sells her paranoia very convincingly. Jason Bateman once again shows that he can be so much more than just a comedic actor. He showed this in 'Disconnect' and now in 'The Gift' he again shows a different side to his personality. Edgerton himself plays the character who initially seems like the typical creepy outsider who'll haunt the couple, but as the film progresses, the film slowly reveals certain aspects of his character and the film somewhat subverts some clichés.

'The Gift' is a bit like the lighter, non-flashy, a little more grounded version of 'Cape Fear'. It does not achieve greatness, but it is certainly a solid, well made thriller especially considering this is Edgerton's first outing as a director. Recommended.

I came into this movie with very little knowledge about the content of the film. Based on the trailer all I knew about the film was that this film was going to be a thriller with some intense moments. All I can is that Joel Edgerton, your debut film was an outstanding success. This film captures your attention from beginning to end. His style of directing is very stunning. This mystery film is very similar to the 1995 film, "Seven". It has a very a dark and ominous tone. Once the film comes to a conclusion, you will be genuinely surprised and satisfied. All the performances in the film were great as well. Jason Bateman's character transition in the movie is quite riveting. As well as Rebecca Hall giving one top performances. Similar to one she gave in the 2006 film, "The Prestige". Overall, I would totally recommend this film. Check it out some time.

I find Psychological Thrillers more chilling as they are real. Ghosts and Monsters may offer jump scares and can make decent horror movies but they don't leave a lasting impression on me as they are so far from realism it takes away much of the fear. A psychological thriller, based around human emotions and characteristics can provide us with a much deeper fear, if done correctly. The Gift is a story of a newly married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) who have moved into a new area, they have their dream, forever house and are very content with their lives. Out shopping for furniture one morning, they bump into one of Simon's old school friends, Gordo (Joel Edgerton). Gordo appears very strange, socially awkward and he certainly leaves an impression on Simon. Over the coming days, Gordo keeps turning up at the house uninvited and regularly leaves gifts on the couple's door steps. 

Joel Edgerton as well as acting in this movie, also wrote and directed it. I will give him serious praise for his direction especially, as The Gift looked visually stunning. The house which was chose for the filming set was a perfect choice, floor to ceiling windows, in a secluded environment were wonderful for a stalker type movie. It really gave the impression that there was nowhere to hide and that he could be watching from anywhere, into any room. The choice of music which he uses to complement the film is another strong factor, he creates suspense well and the more disturbing scenes are edited perfectly. On direction and cinematography alone I was very impressed, sadly this wasn't enough as I felt the movie lacked elsewhere.

Jason Bateman, better known for his comedy roles, did a reasonably acceptable job in this movie, he wasn't anything to shout about but he did make the role his own quite well and was quite believable. Rebecca Hall didn't give an amazing performance in my opinion, she was quite underwhelming if I'm honest. She was supposed to be the person you were supposed to really like but as her character was so annoying and made ridiculous choices consistently, she really wasn't that relatable. However, it was refreshing however to see a 'strong wife' role as appose to the usual emotional wreck, screaming female role we are forced to watch in so many of these movies. Joel Edgerton gave a strong performance, easily the best of the lot. His character was uncomfortable and edgy without being over the top. He was subtle, which I found quite freaky as it was much more realistic. The supporting cast are few and far between and the little screen time they did get wasn't anything special.

The Gift is a slow burner, it progresses at a very leisurely pace, building suspense and mystery very well as the story unfolds. It is very much a thriller, not a horror, although there are a couple of cliché jump scares which were passable as they weren't overdone and did feel quite relevant to their situations. The Gift is a story of Winners and Losers, with strong emphasis on people's belief that the winners keep on winning while the losers deserve to keep on losing. 

My main problem with The Gift is that the more the story unravels the less you seem to care about the characters, they all seem so hollow and I didn't find myself cheering any of them on. As things started to come together I was impressed with certain aspects of the movie but ultimately felt a little flat. I was expecting a lot from the film, it had a big hype with some very good reviews and it's a genre that I usually enjoy.

The overall end message is striking, with the climax of the movie coming together quite well. The story definitely goes full circle with an ending that should give great satisfaction to the viewer; sadly for me I found it to be a little underwhelming.

Joel Edgerton's filmmaking career commences on an impressive note for The Gift is a finely balanced, smartly scripted & wonderfully executed thriller that makes splendid use of all its elements to deliver a consistently tense & captivating movie that scores high marks in most departments and is a welcome addition to its genre.

The story of The Gift follows a young married couple who have relocated to a new town for a fresh beginning & to start a new family. But a chance encounter with an old acquaintance sets in motion a chain of events that ultimately turns their life upside down as this old friend not only showers them with numerous gifts but also an unsettling secret from the past.

Written & directed by Joel Edgerton, who also stars in the movie as a supporting character, The Gift is smoothly narrated from start to finish and allows the moments of uncertainty to shape up in an incredibly natural manner. The production design is impressive, camera-work is concise & fluid, its 108 minutes of runtime is expertly paced, and music has a very muted presence.

Coming to the performances, the cast mainly comprises of Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall & Joel Edgerton, and even though there isn't any standout work from anyone, all of them do a good enough job with their given roles. Bateman & Hall play the married couple and share a good rapport with each other throughout the picture while Edgerton is just as committed in front of the camera as he's behind it.

On an overall scale, The Gift is a skilfully written & splendidly directed psychological thriller that's much aware of its limitations, plays well to its strengths and for a debut feature, it's a very sophisticated piece of work. Thoroughly developed in script form & effectively brought to life on the silver screen, The Gift is a wickedly twisted revenge flick that honestly turned out to be better than my initial expectations and is definitely worth a shot.

The Gift isn't strictly speaking a horror movie, but it is a movie about ghosts. No, not the translucent specters of the dead, but the ghosts we live with every day, the echoes of our decisions, both good and bad, and how they affect us years later, change our lives, define our identities.

The story begins with Simon, a well-to-do lawyer running across Gordo, an old acquaintance of his in a chance encounter after moving to a new town. Gordo starts stopping by Simon's house unannounced, dropping off little gifts, chatting with his wife, Robyn. There's nothing inherently menacing about any of these gestures, but Simon begins to suspect that there's something just a little off about Gordo. Robyn believes Gordo is just trying to make friends, but Simon insists that something is wrong.

To delve further into the specifics of the plot would risk spoiling a deftly plotted mystery. This is a film that is best seen with as little information as possible, partly because the very genius of the story is how it plays on the audience's ingrained preconceptions. The element of mystery isn't just a gimmick leading up to a cheap twist. It's a tool that's used in the indictment of the viewer, a device that forces us to consider how we choose who to trust and who to dislike. The film doesn't just present a skewed perspective, it makes us complicit in accepting that perspective.

The Gift is reminder that the past isn't a thing that simply disappears. The things we have done come back to haunt us when we least expect it, and though we might change how we look and where we live, the core of who we are often remains unchanged, for better or worse.

From a technical perspective, The Gift is yet another example of why Blumhouse is such a powerful presence in the world of genre horror today. There's nothing too showy or "big budget" happening here, but the impressive filmmaking craftsmanship on display serves the story perfectly, and the lead actors all bring incredible nuance and subtlety to their characters.

The Gift is a thriller and a mystery, but it's also a character piece. It's a lesson about how difficult it is to truly know someone, how difficult it is even to know ourselves. It draws us in and then makes us think, and it holds up a mirror to our souls.

'The Gift' is a psychological thriller in the true sense of the word. It's all about psychology: at the end of the film, the lead characters are completely different persons from who they seemed to be at the beginning. The hero becomes the villain, and vice versa.

Not many directors can pull this off in a believable way, but Joel Edgerton does it perfectly. Every development is logical and the screenplay is constructed in an extremely clever way. It centres on Robyn, a housewife who slowly discovers that her husband not only hides episodes from his past from her, but also is a very different sort of person from the one she thought he was. The truth is slowly uncovered because a person from the past turns up on their doorstep, and makes Robyn question her husband's statements.

There are no unnecessary sidelines, so the story stays focused and the viewer is constantly challenged to reassess his view on what he sees happening. Even at the very end, there is a nice twist to make the viewer keep on questioning if what he thinks happened, really happened. This is a very entertaining movie with lots of suspense.
