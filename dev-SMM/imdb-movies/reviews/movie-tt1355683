### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Black Mass serves as a nice redemption for the floundering career of Johnny Depp, who has leaned more on quirky voices and loud makeup than his actual skills in recent years. His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas).

Black Mass: A Near Miss

'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up job given him in the film adds to the fright. 

'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That, and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie is both too much and not enough. 

'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist. There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters. 

As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing: Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger, his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy Bulger. 

As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would have made for a better movie. 

Rating: Matinée

For the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream. 

Peace, Tex Shelters

I swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making the Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from the IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just seemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated with the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed informants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers.

If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action movie compared to Black Mass.

There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices - leading to predictable consequences.

But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.

But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best (including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.

If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!

Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.

my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.

Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people.

That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only "rise" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors.

I try not to get my hopes up too much for certain movies, and "Black Mass" (which I got very excited about) just reminds me why.

Oh, Scott Cooper... how did you manage to make one of the most twisted, unusual, and mysterious gangster stories into an emotionless web of a film? From acting to editing, there was so much wrong that it's almost surprising.

My main issue was the nonexistence of a certain necessity: stakes. In all great mafia flicks, stakes are essential. Would "Goodfellas" have been as remarkable if it didn't feel like any wrong move would set off a universe-ending set of events? Would the "Godfather" have been considered the greatest film of all time if a war wasn't seconds away from breaking out? "Black Mass" managed to keep a story that easily could've had those steaks from having any at all. This was, of course, caused by the emotionless acting, but more on that in a second. But this film really made me not care if the protagonist (whether you consider that to be Bulger or Connolly) lives or dies; and in a mob movie, that is a worse crime than anything committed on screen.

So the acting I blame entirely on Cooper. Every single actor did a great job with what they were given, but the problem is that they were given the wrong thing. For example, Depp was probably told to play a silent yet psychotic, friendly yet intimidating crime lord. Did he do that well? Absolutely. Is that who the character was written as? Not at all. Same goes for Joel Edgerton's - who I thought did the best job out of all of the actors - character, Jesse Plemons' character, and even smaller characters like Adam Scott's. All those actors did well, but not in the right parts.

The list goes on with issues, so let's talk about why the movie got 2 stars rather than zero (therefore, let's talk about the positives). I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. Also, I thought the shooting locations were very well chosen, as they really captured the narrow-mindedness of the lead characters' lives.

So should you see this movie? -If you love mafia movies of any shape or size, then go see it. -If you love Johnny Depp, wait until it comes out on demand. -If you don't love mafia movies, haven't seen many mafia movies, or just have none of the listed qualities above, then don't see this film.

Black Mass is a crime drama movie revolving around the true events behind the Winter Hill Gang and the gang's leader Whitey Bulger played by Johnny Depp. The premise for the film was very interesting as it played on Whitey Bulger's connections as his brother, William Bulger, played by Benedict Cummberbatch is a Massachusetts State Senator while one of his childhood friends John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton is an FBI agent. This an amazing premise however it was not fully executed as it focused mainly on Joel Edgerton's character and Cummberbatch's character felt out of place at times. This may have been a more realistic approach however I felt like they could have utilized Cummberbatch's character more in the film as it would have added two assets for Whitey. The Film is divided in three parts overlooking Whitey's almost twenty year reign. However because of this approach it leaves viewers wondering what happened in that time frame and feels as if it was forced to make the movie feel more like the actually events, so spread out. The cinematography and direction of the film is very crisp and sleek which makes the film a lot more enjoyable. The acting all together throughout the film is superb as it holds a stellar cast. I found Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton,Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cummberbatch to be all great. Depp's performance was electrifying and he should get an Oscar nod but I would not be surprised if he does not get one.

Overall decent film

The intrigue of all crime movies relies on a simple idea: people are complex, but actions are not. Behind every reductive, one-word crime "murder," "theft," "extortion" is a human with a motive and a history to support that motive. Part of the reason we follow the stories of criminals is to overlay ourselves on their paths, trace the steps around their intentions, and see where they turn where you would not. Great crime stories give us the opportunity feel our own humanity guide us through darkness. Unfortunately, I felt nothing while watching Black Mass.

Heralded as a return to acting form for Johnny Depp, Black Mass tells the true-crime story of James "Whitey" Bulger, a mythologized, south-Boston crime lord who operated from the late 70's to early 90's. As an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI-informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). At the behest of Connolly and his less enthusiastic boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Bulger provides information that precipitates the downfall of the Italian mob, allowing his own Winter Hill gang to take over all aspects of Boston crime, from the drug trade to money laundering, and everything in-between.

However, with such a compelling, cant-fail crime premise, the film is bafflingly hollow. Other than hearing a laundry list of crimes that Bulger supposedly spearheads, we almost never see any crimes being committed, other than the odd shotgun rampage or prostitute murder (both which felt sadly derivative for such gruesome scenes). Doors slam, money is exchanged, and men with furrowed brows walk hastily down empty alleysbut it never feels like we are made to understand why.

Where is the money coming from? What are Whitey's motivations? Who are the victims of these crimes, or rather, where are the commoners (for a film with such a large cast, it seems completely devoid of extras) of Boston at all? Even the undeniable Benedict Cumberbatch seems adrift and misused in his role as Whitey's state senator brother Billy Bulger.

Director Scott Cooper chose to focus only on a handful of key years during Whitey's reign of terror, perhaps to draw focus on his peak instead of wasting time on his rise or fall. Unfortunately, the result is a dubiously avowed criminal juggernaut who feelsand sometimes lookslike he is made out of paper. Much has been made of Depp's transformation into the balding, ghostly Bulger through the magic of makeup, prosthetics, and false teeth. He looks legitimately ghoulish throughout the film, yet the performance feels thin and insubstantial, perhaps less due to Depp's acting than to the camera's disinterest.

Depp does has his moments, especially in one particularly tense scene where he slinks out of the shadows to confront Connolly's untrusting wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson), lurking over her like a pale, demonic shadow. During that scene, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. Afterwards, I could only lament the fact the rest of the movie didn't try harder to be a horror movie, or didn't try harder to be anything interesting at all.

Black Mass has the trappings of a great film with solid performances, beautifully lit shots, and a wealth of source materials, making its ultimate failure that much more disappointing. Crime stories are a staple of American cinema and we accept them for their inherent limitations. However, in 2015 it's simply unacceptable to approach the making of a crime movie with absolutely no creative spirit.

Several other reviews have likened Black Mass to a poor imitation of Goodfellas or other Scorsese films. If Goodfellas is the gourmet pâtisserie of crime movies, then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon, a fluorescently lit sprawl of half baked, cookie-cutter crime characters we've all come to expecta dash of angry FBI chief here, a sprinkle of disgruntled mob grunt therewho delivered their lines and then seemingly evaporate into stale air. The movie runs over two excruciating hours yet fails to make plain the impact of the Bulger's crimes, resulting in a story which accomplishes the impossible feat of feeling both protracted and unfinished.

Scott Cooper strives to portray Whitey Bulger as the boogeyman, an unstoppable nightmare whose actions are made infinitely more terrifying by the knowledge that they exist in reality. Instead, Black Mass is the kind of dream that you forget the instant you wake up.

I saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in college). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the qualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the mob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the godfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like Johnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but I feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted his talents on a weak supporting role.

I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey Bulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded mobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential criminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and murder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics of Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in the everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique, problematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen one normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2 hours long. 

Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but lacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie. 

P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache.

I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to inform others about how awful this film was. And I want to prefice this by saying I love crime films and have seen the greats such as Goodfellas, the Godfather, and The Departed but this was just drivel. 

Let's start with the acting: Johnny Depp plays Boston crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger and reveals virtually nothing about the character he plays aside from the violent actions he portrays. The supporting cast does nothing to make this a compelling story either with the exception of Joel Edgerton's John Connolly as a street-wise kid turned FBI agent loyal to Bulger's cause. 

The pacing and dialogue are also the biggest culprits here. The film develops slowly leaving the watcher wondering if it will ever pick up to an emotional crescendo with only to find out the ride is as monotonous as your daily drive. Moreover, the dialogue feels like students taking turns reading out of a textbook. I know that the film is a biographic one but there's no need to have it feel as though you're reading a Wikipedia article. 

Likewise, the musical score tries to underpin the uneasy feel of the movie but only works to put the viewer to sleep with its two tone rise and fall. None of the cinematography and shots of the scenes work to create anything worth capturing attention. There are shots of Southie that do convey the bleak outlook of Bulger's turf but they are few and far between as the film mostly focuses on the boring and uninspired dialogue and setting the actors are captured in such as living rooms, offices, dark bars, and car interiors. 

If I was to summarize watching this film with an analogy I would describe it as eating and tasting a cardboard box.

The icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger stare out from the screen in Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" like the gaze of some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait, holding his ground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly calculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing Bulger embodies the role, or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny Depp's mesmerizing performance  a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires  is the chief selling point of "Black Mass," there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger's South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an anti-"The Departed" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case), the movie has an intentionally muted, '70s-style look and feel that may limit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd, but quality- starved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the fall's first serious, awards-caliber attractions. Not only that but Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays as a Senator and as Whitey's brother) has given a stellar performance. He is truly a talented person who gives his all in every film/show he acts.

BOTTOM LINE: Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar, if not then at least a nomination. Truly worth watching

The only time I ever recall of being terrified of Johnny Depp as a character was in Sweeney Todd and I never thought he could top that performance. 

But I stand corrected, his performance as Whitey Bulger is not only terrifying as hell but one of the best performances Depp has ever pulled off! This is the type of the film that makes you want more and more after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. Scott Cooper did an amazing job in this biopic he also she be up for best director, Joel Edgerton steals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the screen time he gets. This film also has a nice funny side to it as well which really makes you laugh then BAM all seriousness. By far probably the best film I have seen this year!

Crime boss is the name of the game. And there is no hero in this. No savior, and no happy tales at the end of the rainbow. This is blood and grit all the way through but it's not all in it. This movie shows the nature of man, a person, as we were shown the gradual change that happened to him as tragedies after tragedies happened to him, and thus show us the unraveling, the change that took him over through out the course of the movie.

There is the love of the father, love of a son, and love of a brother. This things are what held him to the ground. It's what held him to be sane in my opinion. And so in the end, we were shown what it is that made him what he is, but still, I would guess many is with me in this that this is no excuse, for the crimes, unforgivable and most unthinkable. In fact, it was in my impression that the character that Johny Depp played was a psychopath. I mean he was calm, and smiling and unsuspecting, till the second he pulls a gun on you. That's how I call those types, not that I've associated myself with those kinds, or so I think, you never know.

But since kids, I have got the sense that they were living in a rough neighborhood. And it is Brooklyn in the 70s and early 80s, so it seems justifiable to speculate that it is the kind of environment that would produce someone likely to be listed as FBI's most wanted list.

As I said, there is no hero in this, just pure truth, and as it usually is, with a changing society where leaders, us secretary attorney, and some dude that'd take over, there is always, without a doubt, change, either for the good or bad and this is what I have observed in this movie. A change of leader, made this criminal group more deadly, but also, due to that same reason, that same group, meet an ugly decline. And since this is a society, that caters the good, I must say that it'd produce well, outstanding law enforcing, disciplined citizens, and as time goes by, ruthless, evil groups get disinfected. It's not really that black and white but what I mean is pretty simple.

Black Mass is a waste of your time and money. DO NOT see this. The number of well-known actors used in this film is a damn shame because every single role is such a cardboard cutout that any lesser-known actor wouldn't have made a difference. Depp plays "Whitey" Bulger, and to constantly remind the audience that he's a real bad guy, he gives stone-cold, eye piercing looks, he throws in the necessary run of the mill curses, kills a few unremarkable people throughout and that's it. Don't expect any action or colorful, well-written characters. Yes, this is based off a true story, but, in the context of the film, there is no significance; it doesn't matter--it's been done a ton before and it adds absolutely nothing new or refreshing to the genre. Except for a couple of interesting subplots (which are all quickly brushed off and "resolved" by a single line of dialogue in a following scene), this film has nothing going for it. And it really is a shame; there are hints of a better film that shine through every once in a while during its seemingly forever-feeling run-time, but, that's not to be had. There's not much more to say because this film really doesn't have much going for it. DON'T go to see this--it really is THAT bad.

I was very interested in watching this film as a true-crime buff. We all understand that there will be a certain amount of theatrical license taken whenever dealing with such subject matter. I didn't expect it to be too far off base from reality since the Whitey Bulger fiasco has been highly publicized. Johnny Depp was a little odd choice in my opinion by his been known to pull bigger rabbits on the hat (even literally). Good to have Johnny Depp reminders every once in while he's a legitimate actor not just trying to fund additional island property.

The problem in films of this nature tend to be how familiar the general public is with the issues and our opinions of what we believe reality to be. We hold film a little too stringently against reality or at least what the media has presented as reality to most of us. I would like to think that enough due diligence has gone into whatever form of dramaturgy has happened by responsible parties to present a relatively balanced film. But in general we want the grit and grime without regard for legalities or implications.

True, the film focuses on alliances and the levity provided that we have always suspected. And we have seen a ton of films in this genre with such focus and we have fabricated our own concepts of how such organizations work, how such unholy alliances are formed, and therefore have an expectation of what we should see. This past history in turn doesn't really provide a fair shake for any film in the current time frame as we have so much the compare it to.

I believe that the real demystification of this spell (not to say the cast wasn't good or to question the deftness of Depp) is that we seem to have seen this story a lot. We know how it ends, we realize there's very little arc and we'd like to see a twist to the hat trick that we haven't seen before... If it sticks to the reality of the situation, it's simply not gonna happen.

Does it deliver? Yes. Is it a Tarantino yarn? Not remotely. Will you be entertained, to a greater extent? Yes.

I think this year DiCaprio may have Depp on this one.

The name James Bulger brings a chill to many older British people. For James was the little boy abducted from a shopping centre in 1993 by two older boys, murdered and left on a railway line. But the subject of "Black Mass" is real-life hoodlum James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) who grew to be the kingpin in the Boston underworld.

Heavily protected by an old friend and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Egerton, "The Great Gatsby") who is running him as an informant, Bulger ruthlessly destroys his Boston Italian rivals and tries to keep one step ahead of sceptical FBI boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) and CIA investigator Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll from "House of Cards"). Told in flashback form, the film charts Bulger's career and his relationship with his brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who (amazing but true!) was the State Senator for Massachusetts.

Depp is a chameleon-like actor. Unlike someone like Tom Hanks (who is always 'Tom Hanks'), Depp transforms himself physically to inhabit his roles: Jack Sparrow; Willy Wonka; The Mad Hatter; Edward Scissorhands  it is sometimes difficult to equate the roles to the same actor. In "Black Mass" he does it again, being almost unrecognisable in the role. But he delivers in the acting stakes and turns in a chilling performance as the psychopathic mob leader. 

In supporting roles are Jesse Plemons ("The Program") and W. Earl Brown ("There's Something About Mary") as his right (and left) arm men and the talented Dakota Johnson as the concerned mother to his son.

Although it's good as a simple gangster film, the film is a little two-dimensional to be great.The treatment of the relationship between the brothers  surely one of the most dramatic and surprising parts of the story  is perfunctory, with Cumberbatch (sporting a good Bostonian accent) having relatively few minutes on the screen.

It's also almost impossible to form any emotional connection with Depp's character. Most screen villains have at least some sense of dark and shade (see Tom Hardy's recent portrayal of Reggie Kray in "Legend"). In contrast, Depp's Bulger is as uniformly dark as the title suggests.

Directed by Scott Cooper it's a workmanlike film, with many inevitably violent scenes. It's certainly watchable. but won't be memorable.

A good movie. For me, biopic as a whole (and in some ways this is the case of this film) are part of a genre that is extremely difficult to make interesting, engaging, or at least curious to the public, that is, it requires a huge racing everyone involved in the production, and also that the story in question has some basis to be adapted to the cinema. Black Mass is not an example of excellence in this type of film, far from it, but can fulfill its role as a whole is good, has an extremely attractive story, and at times his many jumps in time cease all very chopped, but the whole experience is justified by a major factor: Johnny Depp. All actors in the main long core are fine in their roles, which already slightly increases the overall grade, but Depp is really fantastic, leaving those who really watches in fear for all who engage with him, even with some dramas placed within the story somewhat unresolved, all convictions and Jimmy Bulger motivations are extremely convincing in the hands of the great actor. Analyzing only the narrative and structure of the feature film the note would be 6 or even 5 though, as the evaluation can not just focus only on a few factors, but in all, 7 seems but fair, a good movie, which has great asset as the expertise of its actors.

"Out of the Furnace" director Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James "Whitey" Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides "Pirates of the Caribbean" star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic "The Departed," a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than "Black Mass." Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous "Pirates" franchise, "The Lone Ranger," "Tusk," "Dark Shadows," and "Mortdecai." Instead, this is the Depp of "Public Enemies," "Donnie Brasco," and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico." As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into "Black Mass" and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, "Black Mass" constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of "Warriors." Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick.

A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, "Black Mass" covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed "Crazy Heart," neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, "Black Mass" is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like "The Departed," "Goodfellas," "The Town," "Killing Me Softly," "The Friends of Eddie Coyle," and the two "Boondock Saints" thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and "Edge of Tomorrow" scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, "Black Mass" omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes. 

A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of "Varsity Blues"), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a "rat!" On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of "Kinsey") that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan.

Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, "Black Mass" succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring "Sherlock" star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in "Black Mass." Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity.

Spoilers Ahead:

This is actually quite easy to review for you: How much do you like Johnny Depp as an actor? He is one of my favorites, so naturally, I gave this movie a borderline recommendation. His Bulger is cold as ice with a penetrating malevolent stare that will freeze your blood. Be warned: this is one dark, brooding look into the 'Winter Hill' gang of Boston. Devoid of the humor of The Departed, this crime drama is deadly serious, I did not think there was even one scene of levity in the entire movie. Actually, one of the creepiest scenes is where Whitey asks one of the Fed's what the secret sauce on his steak was; when the guy first tells him it is a family secret, but then relays it, Bulger glowers at him,"You would give up your F family secret that easily? That makes me wonder what the F else you would give up about me?" What is great about Depp's performance is how understated it is; there are no wild gesticulations, yelling or screaming, he is pure intensity with this laser beam stare. Unlike most mob movies, this one, to its credit, portrays crime as it was: a business. The movie follows Bulger's Machiavellian use of the Feds to destroy his Italian competition; in effect, he uses them to wipe them out while feeding Connolly nothing about his organization and continuing his own nefarious operations out of their vision.

There are a few 'Departed' moments with the head Fed Bacon yelling, cursing and charging that felt phony. The main complaint you read here from the detractors does obtain, it is quite slow. The movie is more a look into 'Whitey' and his use of people. Those of you expecting a fast paced action crime movie like GoodFellas are going to be disappointed. Depp's Bulger is best in his quiet malevolence, this seething presence that creeps everyone out like Connolly's poor wife who makes the mistake of retreating from the dinner party which catches Bulger's attention right away. One of his best scenes in the movie is this ominous one with Connolly's wife. Bulger continues using Connolly, and his state senator brother, to protect his operations and destroy the Italians. Not remotely for children, it features some grisly killings performed personally by Bulger. What I did like about the movie was the lack of glamorization of the Mafia. We don't get catchy background classic rock where killings are cool and idealized. One of the most disturbing is a prostitute who heard too much. Bulger takes her into an apartment, pretending it is hers and kills her. We can not see it but we hear it and it takes awhile.

The look on the boyfriend's face is what I thought made it unique. Bulger's Evil is not theatrical and just horrible things happen to him. His son dies from an allergic reaction to aspirin, his family dies, there is this sense of his deeds returning back upon him. For all its flaws: slow, dark and depressing, find me another modern American movie that shows the Mafia without the usual making it look cool? If you are a Depp fan, like me, you will not want to miss this performance. Again, it is quite a Hellish journey into Night; you will not be whistling a happy tune when it ends. There are some killings but, really, it is a study of a legendary criminal who was Death walking. Just one outburst, by a drunken associate, was enough to earn you a bullet in the back of your head. I actually preferred this performance to Donnie Brasco. I thought this was a much more mature, skilled Depp reading. For all of its Night, the horrors that came back upon Bulger provided a moral base deep underneath the narrative. It is not nihilistic, Bulger loses everything with a shot of him sitting in his ghost house, everyone dead now. Above all, an honest appraisal of the existential costs of killing others for money. Borderline But Worth Seeing. Q.E.D.

In the 70's, the Irish criminal James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) is the leader of the Winter Hill Gang in South Boston after imprisonments for many years. His brother William "Billy" Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a Massachusetts Senator. When the ambitious FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) is assigned to investigate the mafia in Boston, he proposes a deal to Whitey, who is a childhood friend, to become an FBI informant; in return, the FBI would neglect any investigation of his gang. They take down the Italian mob with Whitey's information while Whitey becomes one of the most powerful and notorious gangsters in South Boston. But when the prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll) is assigned to Boston, he demands investigation of Whitey despite the interference of Connolly and Whitey becomes one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.

"Black Mass" is another crime film based on the biography of a notorious gangster, this time the criminal James "Whitey" Bulger in South Boston. The impressive performance of Johnny Depp is maybe the greatest attraction of this movie. The story is like many others of notorious American gangsters, with violence, corruption and justice in the end. "Black Mass" never disappoints fans of this genre and the production is careful with the atmosphere in the late 70's and 80's. My vote is seven.

I watched this on a plane ...what a joke...I am sick of the bogus Boston accents too...Depp is bad, don't kid yourself.

If you read the weasle confessions from the gang...you have the story...they just seemed to act out what has been written in newspapers....it starts with a bad script and no back story....everyone is so in awe about Jonny Depp transformation from a drûgged out punk movie actor to a semi bald Bulger...please! It is holly weird they can make anyone anything....bad movie, bad acting...go see a high school theater group it will be more entertaining and much more talents.

They miss out a lot on what really happened with Jimmy and southie, no shakedowns, no Framingham aqueduct hit...lots missing. Seemed they just rushed through it all and had no drama.

The American crime genre is arguably the cornerstone of modern cinema. Think cinematic masterpieces and there's a good chance every third one is a mobster flick or underworld yarn. This breed of film is nothing if not reliable. Why, then, is the first notable movie about one of U.S.A's most notorious and durable heads of crime so unmemorable? Checking off key points in an organised but uninspired manner, this James "Whitey" Bulger biopic is seemingly more concerned about fitting in all the Wiki-worthy moments rather than truly delving into the psyche of a monstrous man. The unfocused script stems from the choice to trace two decades of Bulger's life (1975 to 1995), an unwieldy stretch of time that results in an unclear filmic timeline and the requirement for truly horrible makeup and wigs. Johnny Depp has succeeded at portraying a gangster before  his John Dillinger in Public Enemies is enthralling  however he's lumped with too many poorly executed physical alterations and character development shortcomings to make an impression here. Aussie Joel Edgerton fares better as a morally intriguing federal agent skating on thin ice, and Kevin Bacon is enjoyable as a frustrated FBI boss, but why Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for such an inconsequential role, as Bulger's Senator brother, is anyone's guess. Scott Cooper keeps it relatively low-key behind the camera, aside from a couple of stylish murder sequences, with the suitably dour cinematography and unfussy score following suit. Overall Black Mass is never overtly bad, per se; its major sin is just being so damn standard.

Poor acting. Extremely slow moving story. Do Not watch this movie. Its barely watchable in bits but largely uncoordinated with no consistent narrative and characters. The director needs to learn to do some editing and script writing. No body in their right mind would have approved this movie to go into production. 

I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. 

All the positive-rated reviews are by Johny depp fan boys and not good cinema critiques. Avoid watching it if you can, at all costs. A sheer waste of 2 hours! The ending is predictable within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Go re-watch the usual suspects instead.

The trailers for this movie were awesome, and contain 5 minutes of amazing acting, directing and writing. The other 117 minutes are a bitter disappointment. All the action in the entire movie is already in the trailer. Nothing else happens. I can think of no reason why anybody would want to pay money to watch this.

This movie looks as though it was intentionally made to bore the audience. I can't imagine anything that could be done to make this movie more boring. Even a black screen for 122 minute would have been better because then you get to sleep.

The movie moves at such a slow pace with so boring a plot and so many attempts at making everybody look good and being politically correct, that even the awesome Johnny Depp performances in the trailer look weak and halfhearted when put into context.

Basically: Watch the trailers (they're awesome), but not the movie!

I really don't know where to start, commenting about this movie. Perhaps I've setup my expectations to high due such a huge marketing media promoting the debut of this movie.

The only thing I know is that I left the movie theater with a sour taste in my mouth. 

I am far from being a movie critic, but I have seen enough good movies from Mr.Depp to know that this one is not his "opera prima" like some movie critics have already said.

The script is sometimes boring, and I wonder what Francis Coppola and a more recent director Martin Scorssese would think about this movie after seeing such a fiasco at trying to characterize the mafia day in the 70 in the American society. Again, I am sorry but I don't see Mr.Depp characterization being as good as the press claims. 

If you have a plan B, pick it, this is not a plan A movie
