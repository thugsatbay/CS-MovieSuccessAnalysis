### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled. 

Firstly,what this is.

I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may have had as a kid.

Second.What this isn't.

Well,not "The worst horror in years".I get that people have different opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.

If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film.

The Babadook isn't for the mainstream crowd. If you're looking for jump scares and scary monsters you wont find any here. The Babadook is a movie that taps into the basal emotion of fear. It portrays the truly terrifying things in life - grief, loneliness, and despair. Not things that freak you out but things that make you unsettled, disturbed, and human.

The acting is fantastic, the story itself is unique and told brilliantly through its subtle writing and directing, it's very well paced, I could go on and on. What I love about this movie especially is the suspense. There is always tension present throughout the movie, like there's an underlying unease to every shot. The way Jennifer Kent crafts these shots is bleak and macabre but not to the point where it's depressing. You're always on the edge of your seat. And I can't give enough credit to Essie Davis. Her performance is Academy Award worthy material, seriously. The son is great as well. At first he may seem obnoxious, and to an extent he is, but he acts exactly how a kid would act in that situation. You believe him. You believe everything these characters are doing, and that's what makes this movie work so well.

The Babadook really is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time and I've seen a lot. Is it scarier than The Conjuring or Sinister? I wouldn't say that, but that depends entirely on your definition of scary. This movie explores the more disturbing and realistic side of the genre, I'd say it's more haunting than said movies for sure. It's psychological horror at its finest. It actually gets under your skin, and when a movie can do that, it has done its job.

At first glance, The Babadook may sound like a tale that warns people  to not let children put creepy stories up into their heads. It may also  be like one of those old horror movies with children being influenced  by the ghost. The titular monster seems to have the potential of being  a silly urban legend, such as Slender Man or the Hash Slinging Slasher  (sorry about that), that is destined to be flooded with fan fiction, or  simply just another horror movie icon, but the film surprisingly has a  different aim than just scaring the audience. It might as well be a  character study of a mother having a hard time moving on after the  tragedy she's been through losing her husband and trying to raise her  only son. The real horror doesn't come out that quick, but there is  already a pretty compelling movie when it come to its characters. The  tension is just the prize for being intrigued by the story's core. 
One thing people must know about the film is it's not generally about  The Babadook monster. In spite that the antagonist has an ambitiously  great campy design and his story is told well by a twisted storybook  with wondrously illustrated diorama, the movie is still laden on the  more human element of the tale, which is the struggle of a mother who  is unable to live normally. The pacing of her life may move too fast  for the film, but the sadness and deprivation beneath those regular  troubling days are totally manifested even without extending any of its  breathing. The plot mostly concerns Amelia finding a way to overcome  Samuel's behavioral issues and her memories with the accident than  dealing with the whole supernatural threat, for sure it is trying to  build some slow burn, but even without that horror movie sense, it  still feels like they're being tormented by life. 
It deliberately takes their personal grief seriously, making sure that  they actually aren't insane, and nobody else could ever understand what  they're going through. This is pretty much the most compelling view of  the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own  nightmares. Mister Babadook only becomes the boiling point of the  ordeal. And when it hits to the part of the real scares, it sells well  whenever the monster attacks. Instead of loud lazy jump scares, it  rather spreads away signs of his presence and its effects to the  family. His appearance has more terror if he's lurking in the shadows.  It also has a nice use of practical effects to endure its very  effective creeps. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for  bringing the real heart of the picture. Essie Davis embraces the  character, making her fear, depression, and shifting madness all  visibly genuine. Same to the young Noah Wiseman who as well gives his  character's actions some sense of anxiety. 
Some horror fans might get slightly disappointed for not giving The  Babadook monster enough of the characterization he deserves. The other  story is a lot more interesting to follow than his diorama tricks, and  that is why I keep stating that the the movie is best viewed as a  gloomy fairytale about a mother and a son fighting to keep a hold of  themselves and promise to protect each other from the odds, even if the  promise doesn't always apply, than just another horror movie being  shown in our theaters. While it still has the right amount of admirably  campy scares, the film often explores to the larger and much affecting  side of the story, and that sure offers beyond than what you expect to  this stale genre.

I saw this film on Copenhagen pix yesterday. The movie was compared to "the orphanage", and even though i liked that film i was a bit in doubt if i should go for it because i was not in the mood for a heavy emotional, mother and son horror-drama. But its everything but. Sure its horror, sure its drama, but the tone is very different from the Spanish movies around same kind of subject which are very serious.This is way more fresh, snappy and sometimes funny actually, without being lame. But also creepy, its the change of moods thats freaky. Nice style. The actors are supreme and the whole socialrrealistic scene around it is far out and overexagerated, which the horror part also is. But it works, because its a metaphorical movie describing a feeling. Its highly original. If you expect the same supernatural children horror movie As you have seen before, think twice. This is new, this is cool, different. The best movie i have seen in a year. Serious. It never gets melodramatic, its fast, entertaining and a bit psychedelic. Very refreshing. And smart, clever. It has it all. I am a big fan.

You've heard of feel-good films, well this is not one. It's creepy and disturbing pretty well all the way, a good old horror fantasy with a nod to the psychological canniness of Nightmare on Elm Street but much more economical in terms of special effects, casting and I would imagine budget. It nevertheless maintains tension and atmosphere along with some high-flying dramatic sequences from the actors which bear comparison with The Exorcist. The plot also connects nicely with the psychological and existential conflicts facing a single mother whose son's birth coincided with the tragic death of her husband, and the whole nasty Babadook phenomenon, and its unresolved outcome, can certainly be read as an allegory of this traumatic event. Maybe it's over-reading to say the film also contains a Nietszchian lesson about the importance of embracing every aspect of one's life and history, no matter how horrific - but it works for me. The acting is amazingly good from the two leads, although the supporting characters are a bit stereotyped, a directing decision presumably. Sets and locations are charged with a bleak gloom, and the colour accordingly verges on monochrome. Love the specially made children's book, and Mr Babadook's physical character, as well as the wonderfully curated vintage movie footage appearing throughout on the TV screen. And a special word for the very fine intricately crafted sound design.

The Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It stars Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall and Hayley McElhinney. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Radek Ladczuk. 

Amelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her husband, she is trying to deal with her young son Samuel's fear of a monster in the house. Initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called Mr. Babadook, signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to fear as well. 

Australia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple of decades, The Babadook is one of the best of the bunch. Jennifer Kent made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called Monster, itself a super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form (Kent's first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in every frame. 

The premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but Kent manages to make The Babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts and terrors. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood's sake, is most refreshing. This is a big character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous Mr. Babadook enters the fray. We care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our hearts are also aching for them. The two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent. 

Mr. Babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their lives. The creature is a sort of cross between a German expressionistic nightmare and Jack the Ripper. The book itself is creepy enough in its own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone  and Amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing  the picture starts playing its ace psychological cards. The monster is kept mostly to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative perfectly. 

The tech credits are top notch. A key aspect to getting the most out of The Babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is tremendous and can bring pounds of goose-flesh rising up on your arms. Ladczuk's photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches of mother and son, but Mr. Babadook is a jet black presence in this landscape. All told the art design from the book to the house and the creature is excellent. 

Umbrella's Australian All Region Blu-ray Release has a super transfer and does justice to the sound mix. There's over an hour of interviews, which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12 minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. The bonus is the 10 minute short, Monster, The Babadook in its infancy but no less scary for it. 

The Babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when Polanski met Kubrick and they decided to pay homage to Fritz Lang and George Melies. Yes it's that good. 10/10

I really enjoyed this film, its dark and unnerving without resorting to loud bangs or "found footage" style filming to get its scares.

Low budget and well shot, the film leans on the power of suggestion and tone to create a film which has a sense of unease throughout, tonally like the Exorcist, where there is this underlying feeling of dread and helplessness 

The scares are not spoon fed, so this won't be for everyone, if your brand of horror is purely just modern films like Insidious or the recent Annabelle - then this might not be for you.

One of my favourite films of the year.

Let me start off with a little disclaimer: I am very picky with my horror movies made after the year 1990. Although some are excellent, I feel that they are few and far in between. I strongly believe that this is one of those few movies, and I urge you to watch it - no review necessary. GO NOW! This is one of those movies that isn't "in-your-face" scary, and it doesn't have jump-scares galore either. It's subtle, suspenseful, and downright creepy. There is a point in this movie where some believe the director lost the audience, but I beg to differ. This simple plot-twist was used to DRIVE the plot, not BE the plot (like in some other big- budget movies I won't name). The only little complaint I have about this film is the ending. I feel like they didn't know HOW to necessarily "kill the monster" properly and wanted a happier ending then most horror movies these days, but that only knocks this one down by one star for me. Now, before I spoil anything for you, I suggest you go and make up your own mind about this new horror classic. This is definitely one I wish we could have had in theaters this past Halloween, I'd buy two tickets!

It's not a typical horror movie and that's also what makes it great. There are some bad reviews here but what I always do is check out the reviewers... I pick one that said the film was horrible and one that said it was great. A quick check on their profile and looking at their other reviews helps give me some perspective on their taste. For example one of the bad reviewers on here enjoyed the movie Jessabelle. While not an awful movie. It's also a movie for dumb people. Simple and easy to understand and nothing really spectacular goes on. The acting is mediocre and the script predictable. It's like a high school film. She also gave Night at the Museum 10 stars. So you can tell she is probably a teenager. I do that with just about every movie I watch on Netflix. To help me not waste time. It's amazing because there are a ton of great movies that get average ratings here, and a ton of average movies that get really high ratings here. Like The Conjuring. That got very high ratings and it just wasn't that great. It was good but not a stand out. America has really really bad taste in film. Actually, in just about every genre of art. We have zero culture , and the rest of the world considers us it's blonde cousin for a reason. We are the dumbest nation in the world. But if a movie gets really high reviews here and those reviews are overwhelmingly good, you can bet it's a pretty good movie. At the least well made and entertaining. This movie stands out for a few reasons and here are the reasons it stood out for me . Because it is totally original. And it's so candid about parenthood.. Any parent can relate to this film, esp if they have kids with "issues" or that have been through a lot in their small lives. It captured perfectly the slightly troubled child. I too think that it showed what I know I've experienced as a single mom with two kids .. That need for space that you just don't get. The need for adult interaction that you also don't get if you don't allow yourself it. So there is a deep well here for character study and relationship dynamics.. I mean deep as in horror movies. So, on top of that the movie is freaky and strange and frightening . This is by far way more of a mind f*** than any Rob Zombie movie for me. A lot of people Really appreciate that kind of movie , like The Hills Have Eyes. They want the most disturbing , cruel , disgusting things to watch. I'm not them . I have to believe a movie for it to be put in the good box. Although those movies are entertainment , they also are like a prank in a way . Like all the directors got together for a game of Spin the Bottle and the ones that made like the Texas Chainsaw films asked for Dare. This movie isn't going to appeal to kids. , isn't going to appeal to the Hills Have Eyes fan club, the people that don't like to expend any energy on thinking , or just in general have short and shallow attention spans that they really a can't focus on anything that isn't doing something horrible is happening.

It's a rare thing when I give anything labeled horror more than a passing glance. The genre has become so completely oversaturated by teen slasher flicks, soulless gorefests and inferior remakes. Having said that I'd heard enough to convince me this may be one of the rare exceptions, unsurprisingly this is a low-key non-Hollywood affair. 

Of course there have been enough horrors over the years for a pretty well defined list of tropes to be a known part of the movie-going consciousness. While The Babadook does deviate from the standard affair we all know and are mostly bored of, it does bring in a few of the more classic tropes, the problem child, the distraught mother and thankfully the illusive villain. Throw in a fair dose of questionable insanity and you have a recipe for a decent classic style horror. 

In this respect it doesn't disappoint, of course it can't hold up to Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist or The Shining but it is certainly familiar of those and in no bad way. Paying tasteful homage to inspirations is acceptable if the movie can stand up on its own weight and in this it succeeds. 

The actual premise itself seems fairly original, although not groundbreaking, the shocks come from the actions of the characters rather than any clichéd jump-scare tactics. As others have mentioned, the underlying metaphor is not too subtle but surely that's part of what adds to the tension. 

There was some really good editing throughout, keeping the feel of a fast paced movie while not rushing the story. The kid actor in it does an excellent job of appearing genuinely disturbed but simultaneously good natured. 

The Babadook may not be a groundbreaker, I don't expect it to redefine the genre and I doubt it will appeal to the younger horror demographic, but if like me you yearn for the spirit of the classics to resurface once in a while, this is a pretty good attempt.

And provided the promise of no sequels is kept, this is one that will hold up well for some time.

{Technically contains spoilers. Nothing to actually spoil}

Suggested tag-line: "The consequences of not spanking your child"

For the entire painstaking extent of the movie, one, and only one, emotion persists: a profound dislike of both of the main characters. The mother, after being in the car during the death of her husband years earlier, has an incredible amount of difficulty doing even the simplest, easiest tasks. Simply put, she is pathetic in the worst meaning of the term; a shell of a person. This may very well have been written intentionally, except that the shear amount of time that has passed makes it unacceptable that she is still somehow unable to handle simple day-to-day experiences even four years later.

It is this inability that has allowed her child to grow to roughly age 4 without even the faintest sign of discipline. Simply put, the child is more of a monster than the actual monster in this movie. Time and time again, he does things to endanger himself and others, all the while the mother just continues on in her own perpetually overwhelmed world.

This situation drones on and on for more than half the movie. To say that it's painful to sit through is an understatement. To say that it makes you despise both of them is understatement.

Given the rave reviews this movie received, I was determined to see it through to the end despite being thoroughly tired of it by the 30- minute mark. What I found was an anti-climatic movie that was sub-par in every regard except possibly the acting, assuming that these terrible characters were indeed as intended. To say that The Babadook is bad fails to do it justice.

Many people that like the movie praise it for being atypical of a horror movie, for being more of a psychological thriller than shock or jump horror, for it's atmosphere. As someone that thinks jump horror to be cheap, and far prefers psychological thrillers any day, let me say this: The Babadook is not a psychological thriller, as it is not thrilling. It is not atmospheric, as the entire movie is dull in every sense. It is not jump horror. It is not shock horror. It is not gore. It is not excited. It is not intelligent. It is not creative. It is nothing more than a strung-out story of two terrible people.

In short, it is nothing.

I honestly don't see how people can say that this is one of the best horror movies they have ever seen and that they found it scary. For me from start to finish it was very poor and made me want to take out the disc and snap it. The little kid in it is a terrible actor, as he just seemed to scream all the way through the film and it got quite annoying to the point where I had to mute the sound as soon as his face popped up on the screen. Yes, there were a few creepy moments but a few minutes later I was constantly reminded of how painfully average this movie actually was. I couldn't believe after all the hype and good comments about this movie that it turned out to be a huge waste of money and time. The idea of the movie was good but it was just executed very poorly.

While "The Babadook" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in "Cabin in the Woods," this film's characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.

Director Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn't of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselveswhat lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. 

The plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don't even watch the trailer.

Just know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent's storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what's real and what's not that you can never be sure of yourself. 

What you make of "The Babadook" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.

Personally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it's scary. But it's also touching and heartbreaking. While "The Babadook" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like "The Innocents" and "The Haunting" (1963), to classify it purely as "horror" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.

On paper, The Babadook had a lot of potential and seemed to promise something refreshing to a genre that desperately needs it. Unfortunately, it suffers from all the usual tropes of horror films, without bringing anything new to the table. I found both lead actors to be particularly annoying : the always whining and screaming boy and the clinically depressed hushing mother. I couldn't care less about their fate ! As far as the monster is concerned, the director didn't bother to explain its origin, meaning or how to defeat it. As always in this case, some may like the fact that it leaves things purposefully open to interpretation, and others, like me, would have preferred if some hints were dropped here and there ! Either way, the ending is really unsatisfying and dull.

I'm sure the film is meant as a metaphor for the mother's grief, but it could have been better if they had more carefully and subtly built the tension, and if the cinematography and score were more sinister. It had potential but I found the pacing to be a bit off and the scary bits were quite cheap. In fact, I'm not even sure you can call The Babadook a horror film. It felt more like a psychological thriller and should have been advertised as such. 5 out of 10.

Although this movie initially had me intrigued by great reviews, attractive teasers and the promise of an original tale, I found myself immensely disappointed at the conclusion of this drawn out film.

I understood the emotional drive behind the very flawed mother character, but that still didn't make me sympathetic to her plight. The fact that she was her own antagonist, and that she eventually turns on her son, does nothing for me as a viewer. By the end, I was just hoping the imaginary villain would kill our protagonist (which would have been suicide a form).

As a whole, this film had very few scary moments, and even fewer moments of suspense, and will likely leave true fan of the horror genre in a state of disappointment.... It wasn't a bad film. But, it certainly was not a good horror film by any means.

On a positive note, I'm very glad the film makers achieved critical and commercial success (despite my dislike of the film). Bravo!

Original and truly terrifying, "The Babadook" proves what a horror-fiction movie could do with involving more on psychological emotion from it's protagonist character rather than shocking audience with ghost appearances. It has totally different ways to scare compared with James Wan's "The Conjuring" or "Insidious". The movie focused on Babadook, a scary creature from children's tale but even The Babadook appearance itself wasn't much exploited and seems too mysterious. The débutant director, Jennifer Kent has successfully and smartly convinced also planted images of Babadook character at audience's mind without much showing what it really looks like and keep them guessing at the ending part. Babadook only appears couple times at shadow, sounds or some hallucinations. 

What definitely makes this film that scary is a standout performance from Essie Davis. Her acting as Amelia greatly portrays a destroyed and depressed mother who have unwell circumstances to raise her only son. At first half of the film, audiences were dragged to feel the stressful condition and sympathy to Amelia but she with her gesture and changed behavior would surely scare them when it reaches last 20 minutes. "The Babadook" is a respectful and undeniably creepy old-school horror movie that is rarely to find these days. With also supported by strong performances from Essie Davis, spooky suggestive premise and surrounded by annoying score, makes Babadook easier to sneak in your midnight sleep and haunt you as worst nightmare.

This is a psychological drama where the protagonist refuses to resolve her own self-generated difficulties. There was no character to identify with in the film. As the film progressed to the ten minute mark, my empathetic response to the self- destructive protagonist had already evaporated. So, who cares?

Netflix classifies this hot mess as Thriller, Independent Thriller, Psychological Thriller. At least they did not mark it as 'horror.' Also, Thriller? Really? There is nothing thrilling (or even engaging) about this descent into the outer boundaries of stupidity.

The Movie Database (TMDb) calls it Drama (yes), Thriller (no), and Horror (no). The film had no body horror, no serial killers, no gore-fest. The madness aspect was all fake, so the supposed supernatural elements were each and every one fake. What aspect of horror is this misstep supposed to represent?

Rotten Tomatoes marked the genres as Drama, Horror, Mystery and Suspense. There is no suspense here since there were no real threats involved. The protagonist's pathology was set clearly during the first 45 seconds. The mystery, I suppose, was whether she would decide to get well. The other mystery is why RT rated this dog so highly.

There are so many dull stretches in this film. At times I thought I was watching Paranormal Activity without the jump scares. Also, watching full-screen, low resolution badly taped ancient television is just boring, whether or not the protagonist thinks she sees something in the childish images. There is nothing there, just the wandering consciousness of a sleep-deprived weakling who has given up on life.

Character development is important but this movie takes it to ridiculous levels. Normally some kind of empathy would be felt between the viewer and characters not here ! Hatred maybe or at the very least just mild discomfort when they are on screen makes this a terrible movie to watch and trying to get to the end of it just to pry the story out is pretty difficult. the story itself is pretty vague to point it's actually more like a suggestion of a story with so many holes and unexplained random plot changes about halfway through I pretty much gave up looking for something of any substance. Some good concepts that could have been put to much better use but in the end just a dreadful monotonous movie!

Had potential, but ends up a pretty average horror movie.

Horror movies are easily the worst, least original genre of movies. Really very little room for originality and tend to fall back on the same clichés.

The Babadook seemed to have potential, though was never that original. The tension and intrigue were built well. However, it pretty quickly fell back on standard horror formulae, and ended in a random, chaotic, confusing, pointless mess.

Good performance by Essie Davis in the lead role. Noah Wiseman makes for a very irritating kid, though that might be the director and script's fault. Even in the beginning, when the movie had potential and hadn't fallen apart yet, the kid was the thing preventing it from being enjoyable.

This movie feels like a whole bunch of graduating film students, armed with their folders of "film theory", decided it would be a good idea to make a feature film out of a short film. Bad idea. 

*this review may contain spoilers*

This is the first horror film I've seen that is depressing. Depressing! If I wanted to see a bleak, psychologically unhinged film with way too many metaphors, I would have picked something else. I read such great reviews all over the net I thought I would buy it and settle in for a night of scares. pfft! my grandmother is scarier than this film.

It feels like we come in halfway through the setup. A seriously annoying and badly behaved kid and a mother already strung out and at wit's end. It doesn't endear empathy - I spent the first half hour being annoyed AT the film for all the caterwauling and shrillness. I did not empathise with the characters. Don't blink or you'll miss the reason - a one line explanation of what happened six years ago. There was no recent catalyst that triggered off the forthcoming events, no explanation of why they would find the book at this time, it just... 'happened'. 

Dreary, miserable, slow, predictable and overly symbolic with no relief. If you wanted to study this film in a course, it ticks all the boxes to endlessly psychoanalise the mind of the mother about whether it is real or some sort of delayed PTSD manifesting as the "the monster in the closet". I understand why they chose the set design to be washed out and shadowy but it didn't change with any action either - there was no high contrast in the scenes outside of the house as to inside the house. No sense of The real world vs the internal struggle. It was just all dull and draining to watch. 

and the dog. really? gratuitous and unnecessary. 

I was looking forward to this film but as an entertainingly good horror movie - I didn't expect I'd have to 'read' it. 

The Babadook failed to impress on either a horror or macabre level.

Not even bad enough to be good.

I totally can see the director was trying to achieve. It seems to me this is a story about mental break down after a tragic loss, and eventual recovery (of sorts). But .... and it's a big BUT. From the beginning the characters are totally unlikable. The mother seems rather trashy and neurotic from film minute 1, the son is horribly obnoxious and generally a pain in the behind - also from film minute 1. The home is chaotic, adding to the general impression of a mental breakdown in process. There's also a dog there, even he isn't very likable, as far as dog likability goes. And of course it is killed (the only reason for it's inclusion?). They simply are unlikable - to me I couldn't care less if Babadook ate the whole street.

Also one moment, possibly not important in the general flow of things, is the visit of the mother colleague from work. Upon hearing the brat isn't sick, he just vanishes from the story - but it adds to the general doom, gloom and surreal feeling of the movie.

Then finally getting over the characters and their dog aren't likable - the movie ends. Good riddance. I've seen worse, I've definitely seen much better.

I was really excited to watch since IMDb has an slightly average rating. But this was one of worst movies I ever seen. The only thing here positive and remarkable was the acting of an very young kid. Mother does also a good melodramatic acting but on other scenes she is way predictable. But probably were the 2 good things of the film. The story behind is completely non sense, rubbish, forced, etc. Im not rating badly because is not an horror movie as it is classified (which in fact is not) but for me that isn't even the point. The point is that is a so weak movie in every aspect. Its so bad its hard to find a category to fit this movie really. I have seen during 45 min and I felt stopped in the time and in the same scenes,no excitement , no surprises, nothing. Obviously i couldn't see it till the end and I've just forward straight to the end.

a big disappointment and it shows that many users of IMDb don't have an idea of what should be made a good movie.

This movie actually starts pretty good, and I thought it was going to keep that pace. But after just a few scenes, I realized this movie sucks. I've watched the whole movie, hoping something would happen that would change my opinion, but this movie continued to sink in its awfulness. I have wasted 1.5 hours of my life on this, I beg you to learn from my mistake and don't watch it. I gotta have 10 lines of text, so I am going to continue writing about how awful this movie is. The worst I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies, trust me. I've read some reviews that actually made some sense into this movie, but it still sucks.

...because it was both sleepy and hollow.

Had it a message or been profound in some manner it might have saved itself. But it wanted to be an artsy horror flick - and failed. It had nothing, really. It was moody, I'll give it that, but what mood I couldn't tell you, unless sleepy is a mood. It just goes nowhere. I don't need jump scares or any gore. That's not horror to me, anyway. There doesn't need to be a monster, either, just the shadows and promise of one will do. Suspense would be nice, though. There is no suspense, unless trying to find the plot or interest is the suspense. For suspense to happen you have to be invested in the characters, or the story. This is just... BaBADook.

Summary: main characters are an annoying whiney-voiced, screamy child and his mother who is suffering from depression (and possibly mania, hallucinations etc) after the death of they boy's father in a car accident when he was driving her to the hospital to give birth to said whiney-voiced son. 

For no seemingly apparent reason the mother starts to have a very serious breakdown. She is still depressed from the death of her husband but this was about 8 or 9 years ago so this has been a very slow breakdown! The annoying kid has been playing up at school and this exasperates matters. 

So one night the boy asks his mum to read The Babadook to him. The Babadook is a children's book that has appeared on the kid's shelf out of nowhere, with no explanation and no question from the mother. The Book is quite a scary one for a child and hints at a demon coming into the house to frighten and/or possess and/or kill the occupants. It would appear that, in Ring-esque fashion, reading the book somehow starts the chain of events that allows The Babadook to enter the house. 

So anyway, the kid starts seeing stuff and has a fit. Then the mum starts seeing stuff. Then the mum gets possessed, goes a bit mental, kills the dog. Then at the end the kid and mother somehow (though not really clear how) exorcise the demon. The demon then seems to be contained in their basement and they collect worms to feed it with (sounds daft? It is). 

There is the slightest hint that the mother may have written the book and my interpretation of the film is that she did, and that she just had a breakdown and the demon is all in her mind. And they keep it in the basement and feed it worms. 

Review: The concept was decent, the book was creepy and there were one or two scenes that were a bit spooky (though I never felt this film got anywhere near as good or as scary as it could have been). The pace was a bit slow, the 2 main characters were annoying and the sub-characters were unessential, badly written padding and even more annoying than the main characters. I thought the ending was a bit naff. While it did entertain us for Halloween night, I think this was a pretty average film and given the annoying characters and lack of scares, it doesn't have any repeat viewing value.
