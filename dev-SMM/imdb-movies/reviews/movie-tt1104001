### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
TRON: Legacy has been one of the most promoted films of the year. With a monstrous budget (around $200 million) and reports saying that Disney is worried that the film isn't tracking as well as they'd hoped, the initial thought process from these rumors is that the TRON sequel will open to a disappointing first place weekend much like the most recent Chronicles of Narnia film. As of this writing, I haven't gotten around to seeing the original film. I wanted to, but thanks to Disney it was pretty much pulled from every retail store imaginable whether you wanted to rent or purchase the film at least until next year. The urge to see TRON: Legacy didn't really sink in until around the time the third trailer was released. While the Daft Punk score has interested me from the beginning, TRON: Legacy just seemed like another overrated piece of eye candy that fan boys were getting excited about. The thing about first impressions though is that they always have the opportunity to be wrong.

The glorified TRON sequel is getting a lot of mixed reviews from most movie critics. The problem seems to lie within the way the film is written and its screenplay. To tell the truth, you don't see a movie like this for a great story alone. The special effects are the main attraction and boy, do they deliver. The way programs disintegrate when they're disposed of, the light cycle battles, airborne chases, and the many fight sequences in the film are just a small example of the dazzling display of some of the most exceptional and impressive special effects ever seen in a cinematic feature. As with most films that have been presented in 3D lately, the 3D effect probably isn't necessary to enjoy a film of this magnitude. It'll be just as entertaining if you save yourself the extra $4 and see it in a conventional theater.

The writing didn't seem as bothersome as much as other reports say. It certainly wasn't the best, but it seemed like enough to add just the right amount of depth to TRON: Legacy and give it more of a background than most films revolving around spectacular special effects. There were a few lines that bothered me. The main one being when Alan first visits Sam and Sam says something about his father probably either being dead or chilling in Costa Rica...or both. Wait, what? It just gives you this Weekend at Bernie's flashback with Bernie being replaced with Kevin Flynn's limp carcass. Some of the lines Jeff Bridges muttered just made him seem way too much like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, which seems awesome but really has no place in the TRON universe. Saying things like, "Check this out," or, "Radical, man," followed by that stoner laugh of his really didn't help matters much. The weak points of the way the film is written are rectified with the way the film never lets your attention out of its choke-hold. You'll be drawn to the screen the entire film; that's practically a guarantee. The right mindset for a film like this can make or break your opinion of the film. If you don't have inflated expectations and don't expect much more than impressive special effects, then you'll probably walk away pleasantly surprised. I actually had a similar mindset during Avatar, which seemed to also suffer/take advantage of groundbreaking special effects being more consuming than the story and had a similar result.

The cast is about as developed as can be expected. The real star of the film is Garrett Hedlund, who does a pretty decent job of carrying the film and being generally astonished that not only was his father alive but the extraordinary world he always talked about actually existed. Jeff Bridges' performance isn't nearly as strong as his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, but he does have his moments. He seems to shine during his reunion with Hedlund and his strongest scenes are with Hedlund alone while being rather flat the rest of the time. Olivia Wilde's Quorra is interesting, as well. There's an intriguing twist to her character, but her fascination and curiosity revolving around the world Sam is from is what gives her character heart. Michael Sheen did seem a bit too over the top at times as Castor, but that may have been the point. The biggest surprise was seeing Cillian Murphy cameo. Given his strong outings in films like Sunshine, Peacock, and Inception, it just left me wanting to see more of his character in future installments assuming this film does well enough to warrant a sequel (or sequels).

TRON: Legacy is certainly the special effects extravaganza it's been made out to be all year. Its fantastic effects certify the sequel as being the most visually appealing film of the year. While the writing of the film isn't quite as polished as the special effects, there certainly seems to be a good enough balance to keep the film afloat and deliver an extremely entertaining way to kill two hours. As far as eye candy goes, TRON: Legacy is an incredible and all around awesome experience.

And it was worth it.

I was 9 years old when I saw TRON in a dingy cinema in Fareham, I was hooked then, and I always dreamed they would make a sequel.

I was seriously worried though, I mean, Escape from New York was another of my favourite movies and I got all excited about the sequel to that... and left the cinema mortified...

Not this time.

This was like an old friend coming home.

There are a lot of comments about this movie having a poor story, personally, I disagree. It was a father and son story, any more on top of the other sub plots going on would have been too much.

It's a hell of an experience for the sences... when those Recognizers flew overhead the cinema shook... immersive, entertaining... everything a good movie should be.

Roll on Number 3.

Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is the CEO of Encom and the world's best video game developer. One night he simply vanishes without a trace and leaves his company in chaos and his young son. Fast-forward 20 years, Sam Flynn (Hedlund) is a rebellious 27 year old and a thorn in the side of Richard Mackey (Nordling), a suit trying to take over his father's company with the help of a software designer (an uncredited cameo from Cillian Murphy). Though Sam is the heir, he refuses to play an active role in the decision-making process. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner) meets him one night with the news that he has received a page from Kevin Flynn's arcade - a number that has been disconnected for 20 years. Thus ensues the inevitable investigation into his father's whereabouts and Sam's transportation into the world his father has created and been trapped in for decades.

Where to begin? Tron: Legacy is a visual feast for your eyes and an auditory pleasure thanks to Daft Punk and Joseph Trapanese. The soundtrack feels ethereal almost and fits perfectly with this new world we have been introduced to for the first time (or the 2nd time if you've seen the 1982 original). 

3D, for me, is a recent scourge that has been infecting and affecting the movie industry. Yes, maybe it is a more lucrative avenue for the movie industry after the setback of heavy piracy but enough is enough! Joseph Kosinski, however, had a vision (and an architectural degree behind him) to give us a mouth-opening, simply beautiful world with the correct blend of 2D and 3D! It is quite simply worth it just to go for the visuals.

What the movie makes up for in spectacular imagery, it lacks in storyline. Maybe I should have watched the 1982 version as so many people have pointed out to me but even without it, the plot seems a little disjointed. The underlying connections to the real world are numerous such as The Holocaust, God complexes, evil doppelgangers and more. You are left with more questions than answers as it is never revealed just what it is about this world that would "change everything" in the real world.

Jeff Bridges is great as both the villain and hero and his computer animated self is simply amazing although at the same time off-putting (this might be the Uncanny Valley hypothesis at work). The acting overall is not anything to write home about (no Oscar winners here) but Hedlund as Sam Flynn holds his own against a more charismatic Jeff Bridges. Quorra (Wilde) provides a potential love interest and the key to changing our world and a doe-eyed innocent view of life that is endearing.

This is a movie that should be simply taken for what it is, a pandering to the original fan base whilst garnering new ones, one not to be over- analysed but simply to be marvelled at with a group of friends. The actions scenes are just jaw-dropping with light cycles (that I wish I owned!) and deadly Frisbees amongst other things. Disney took a risk to continue a series almost 3 decades later rather than going for the easy option of re-imagining it. A wise move.

I have never seen the original 'Tron', nor do I really know much about it really. I've only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer's trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie 'Tron', and everyone says "No."). The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside "The Grid" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...

Garrett Hedlund is good as Sam Flynn. Yes, he has to utter some clunky dialogue along the way and is a bit stiff at times, but he serves the role well enough. At times he reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (what with the pulling out of lightsabers...I mean discs, donning of cloaks, etc) - though not half as bad as him.

Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Sam's dad, Kevin Flynn. The only thing that detracts from his acting is his digitised clone, Clu. No matter how hard they have tried to create a youthful-looking Jeff Bridges using computer magic, he still looks like a "cartoon" (as someone in the audience put it). While it's annoying, it would have at least been tolerable if it had been limited to just the scenes inside The Grid. However, the movie starts in the the real world with a "young" Kevin Flynn telling his son the story of Tron/The Grid, and you can plainly tell the drastic difference between a real and fake Jeff Bridges. It's so obvious, and very distracting. 

Olivia Wilde kicks butt and looks great doing it (in her skintight catsuit with neon highlights and her asymmetrical wig) as the warrior, Quorra. She seems to be having a lot more fun with this role than she does with that of Thirteen on 'House'. Quorra has a slight naivety about her in regards to some things, and displays a sense of childlike wonder on occasion (especially the end), which gives her some depth. Wilde and Hedlund share some good scenes together, and her character at least gets *some* development - which is more than I can say for the albino-like "Siren", Gem (Beau Garrett).

Michael Sheen is memorable as Castor. While he does tend to "ham it up" a bit, it's nonetheless a delightful performance.

Apart from the animation of Young Kevin Flynn, there are a couple of other 'minuses' of the film, like the dialogue (which is oftentimes average) and the fact that the film itself does seem to drag in spots/go on for a bit too long.

However, the visuals *do* almost manage to make up for most of the film's faults (almost). The movie looks stunning - after we get past the kinda boring beginning and are transported along with Sam inside The Grid. Light Cycles, Light Runners, all mode of "Light" transportation make for thrilling action/chase sequences. Then there's the "games", that mostly seem to involve throwing discs - which resemble Xena's round killing thing - at each other, causing those who are hit to "derez" (ie. cease to exist). Another 'plus' for this film is its excellent score. It adds SO much to the movie.

The film is entertaining enough, but probably not the non-stop action some people are expecting/hoping for. If you're looking to kill a couple hours watching something that's visually pleasing (but, at the same time, may give you a headache/sore eyes thanks to the 3D), then 'Tron: Legacy' is worth checking out. Fans of the original may or may not like this movie, I'm not sure, but I know that for someone like myself - who's being introduced to the world of 'Tron' for the first time - it was quite something.

WARNING: SPOILERS *****************

Visually, a feast, but a leisurely script leads to a muddled climax. 

A fan of the original since 1983, I had been looking forward to this for a long time. The trailers & stills looked very promising. Sadly, while it looks good, some questionable decisions have been made, and the film doesn't seem to know what to do or where to go.

Some of the original concepts seem to have been dumbed down for audience acceptance. Programs, formerly living a uniquely digital lifestyle, sipping energy from pools, worshiping users, are now just like regular dudes with funny clothes. They work, sleep, eat, drink, and go to clubs. 

Perhaps this dumbing down is why this film poses more questions than it answers. 

Why has the digital world taken on analogue characteristics like dust, atmosphere & functionless water? 

Why do the digital Recognizers, previously smooth, humming machine menaces, now have exhaust flames & jet engine noise?

Why do light cycles sound like they have gasoline engines? 

How can a totalitarian digital society have "homeless" programs (who drink from brown paper bags yet)? 

Why do all the programs now leap around and pose exactly like Asian martial artists? Just, why?? 

How were the Isomorphic algorithms going to change the world? 

How was CLU going to conquer the world with a bunch of computer programs who were good at throwing disks?

When young Flynn switched off the server, was the world destroyed? (if so, shouldn't he have waited, since (a) the threat had been stopped, and (b) in case there were still some of those useful ISOs surviving, especially since he (and the audience) have no clue as to how to use them?) 

If hours in the digital world were minutes in the real one, and in the real world it's been 20 years, does that mean that old Flynn had been trapped for up to 1200 years? (which might explain why he's channeling The Dude from "The Big Lebowski")

The biggest disappointment for me was the almost complete absence of the title character. By the end of the film, I still wasn't sure where Tron was. I had to read some summaries on the Internet to find out.

I would have preferred it if Tron, in his last act, saved the day. Sadly, when he did (briefly) appear, he was ineffective and pointless.

I was a fan of the original Tron. Original ideas and logic have been dropped for populism & eye candy. The subtle humor & in-jokes are absent. This is a disappointing followup.

Right off the bat I'm going to say that I didn't see the first film. Obviously I've heard from a lot of people saying that they need to see the first film before watching this one, seeing as this is a direct sequel to a nearly 30 year old cult sci-fi film. But, seeing that I didn't have time, I decided to watch the sequel anyway.

Now keep in mind that Disney took a HUGE risk in making a sequel to a movie that is not very often talked about when it comes to movies as opposed to many blockbusters today. The first TRON had no famous franchise to speak of (apart from the real games inspired by it). Adding to the danger is the film's budget - reportedly between US$ 200 - 300 million. With that kind of money you'll wonder what exactly was Disney hoping for with this film.

Nevermind the fact that the story is a bit unfocused and could be rounded up in a more polished way. Nevermind too that the fantastic world and great ideas aren't expanded upon some more, as well as the fact that the script could use a little bit more originality.

Also, not forgetting some good (in Jeff Bridges' case, great as always as he plays two very different characters with perfect emotional resonance - proving that he still has the chops to carry a big movie) performances by the cast - with Garrett Hedlund showing great leading man potential and Olivia Wilde looking great and cute to boot. Michael Sheen, Beau Garrett and Bruce Boxleitner (apparently returning to his role from the first film, so it seems) all give good support.

No sir-ee, what you pay for - and what you get in spades - are the special/visual effects. Goodness me, this is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen all year, and that's saying something. I have to admit though, the CGI that makes Jeff Bridges young look jarring, but that is overshadowed by the compelling, groundbreaking special/visual effects that really bring you into the cybernetic world. Who doesn't want to take a ride on one of those fantastic, futuristic vehicles? Who doesn't want those awesome light-cycles or one of those dueling/data discs? It is possible that, like "Avatar" a year ago, this film can be a game-changer for special/visual effects alone.

It's a real treat for the eyes, and it's even better in 3D which is splendidly used to flesh out the dimensions and graphics of the cyber world bring you even deeper into the world instead of things merely flying out to you and post-production conversion like in SO many 3D movies (Note that in the 3D version, there's a disclaimer before the film starts, saying that parts of the film are filmed in both natural 2D and 3D as they way they should be. Just so you know, this shows that the filmmakers care for what they want to give you).

Very ambitious architect-and-designer-turned-first-time-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski hit a home run with this film, crafting an extraordinary and spellbinding world of escapism that looks slick, stylish and extremely cool to watch. Kosinski and the production team fill the cyber world with heaps of imagination and the result is what you see on screen. And here I thought Hollywood would recycle certain design patterns (plot patterns still need work though). Kosinski is a truly visionary filmmaker that one really has to keep an eye on.

The production design is on par with the special effects, it is nothing short of spectacular and perfect. The cinematography which is big and wide and best of all NOT shaky allows you to savor every moment of SFX goodness. The superb sound effects serve to complement the visuals and the electronic world, and all for the better. Daft Punk's varying but atmospheric electronic/orchestral score all but suits the film's mood perfectly with its techno beats and soaring string during moments.

Overall, this is perhaps a fine way to end the blockbuster season of 2010, and this is a definite must watch for all looking for an escape. The special effects alone are worth the price of TWO movie tickets, and with that I say, give this one a try, even if you haven't seen the first one. It aims to entertain and to dazzle the audience, and it succeeds brilliantly. Excuse me while I rent the first one now.

Overall rating: 75/100

A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it's live-action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?). And there it is, "Tron: Legacy", a science fiction movie, Disney science fiction movie, live-action and targeted for kids. And yet, 3D.

"Tron: Legacy" is actually a sequel to the 1982 revolutionary film, "Tron" and marks the directorial debut of Joseph Kosinski. "Legacy" sets Kevin's son, Sam Flynn, 27 years in age as the main character who gets a message from Kevin (or so it is) from the world of Tron. He then goes to Flynn's arcade, enters some sort of mysterious room and plays with a computer which digitized him and entered him to the world of Tron. Then, he fights with other programs trying to find his father, Kevin Flynn who disappeared years ago. On the way, he meets Quorra, some cool machines and of course, Clu (Kevin's program).

I watched "Legacy" and found it to be really good. The rendering of the world of Tron was really breathtaking and got me in awe. All of the world is definitely going to make "Tron: Legacy" one hell of a blockbuster film and surely, one of the best films on the year 2010.

The acting had no problem. Jeff Bridges, after all those years since the first film is still fresh as ever. Garrett Hedlund was also not a problem in the film. Olivia Wilde as Quorra was stunning. The acting was definitely perfect. Everything.

The 3D effects. This was one funny thing. In the beginning of the film, it was noted that some parts of the film were in 2D and some were in 3D and you were asked to not take your 3D glasses off. I did broke the rule several times and saw something unique. Parts that were set in the real world, not in the world of Tron were displayed in 2D and parts that were set in the world of Tron were displayed in 3D. Anyways, the 3D worked pretty well. The Lightcycles in the film and all the things in the world of Tron, displayed in 3D were awesome.

The score of the film was also exciting. (The soundtrack was also great as it reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.) It was very awesome and thrilling with all the bass and everything. 

Overall, "Tron: Legacy" is worth to watch. 3D works pretty fine in watching this film. Young kids would not really like this but maybe aged 8 and above would do. I believe this is the best film for December 2010 and is a good way to end blockbuster movies of 2010. Great job, Kosinski. 

Prince AJB's Score: 85%

Thank you for reading my review on "Tron: Legacy" and hope it's useful.

Tron is on it's way to become the most over-rated movie of 2010. It's a candy-wrapped insult to intelligence, as well as to the original. 

First, the visual effects. Although they look stunning in their all-black-and-neon style, there's not much original about them. It's chases and fights like we've seen a zillion times before. The worst thing is that most original idea from the original Tron is dropped. In the 1982 version, the light bikes were making sharp 90º turns without losing any of their phenomenal speed, really like electrons moving over the grid of a computer chip. It gave them an unpredictable and dangerous feel, and the impression of an eerie universe where normal laws of physics don't apply. In the new Tron, however, everything looks much more realistic. The bikes ride like normal bikes, planes fly like normal planes, and people die like normal people. Except for the fact that they disintegrate into little square pieces... Whoo, surprise! What is supposed to be a world of competing digital programs, is just a dark street with people walking around in funny dresses and plastic umbrellas. Yes, it even rains, and there's bums with (how modern!) plastic bottles. The good guys are white, the bad guys are red. Except for that eccentric (read; gay) disco owner who turns out to be a traitor... No, I can't say I've been visually surprised once.

Then the story. It's the kind of script that does away with reason. Facts are stated in sentences like "My disk is the key!" or "The portal is only open for 8 hours!" or "It will change the world! Science, quantum mechanics, religion, everything!" without explanation. The most ridiculous are the "ISO's", some tribe of digital people who 'just appeared out of nowhere', whose last surviving chick becomes of major importance because daddy says she must -at all costs- become human. All for no apparent reason, other then filling a void script. But our adolescent hero doesn't need reasons or explanations, because all solutions to his problems are handed to him on a silver platter anyhow. When the going gets rough, there's always a car or a train or some pretty girl appearing out of nowhere to take him exactly where he has to go. All he has to do is comply. It's no adventure, it's plain boring. 

But sometimes it looks nice. And the abundance of little stupidities in this film, like the paper pig they're having for digital dinner, make it funny. So I guess you could say it provides an enjoyable evening!

I wouldn't call myself a TRON hardcore fan - I couldn't even crack a single message from their website during their "Flynn lives" viral campaign. Still, I know the movie perfectly well - I watched it on a movie theater when I was 8 years old, and I simply could never get out of my head the Recognizers and Lightcycles. I did master the Intellivision Tron Deadly Discs game, and the movie jump-started my love for all things computer related. I've watched the 20th Anniversary DVD and all the extras far more times than I can care to count. Guess I'm a TRON hardcore fan after all.

I had mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, a sequel to TRON made all the sense in the world - the original movie correctly predicted plenty of concepts that we now take as granted (the importance of a network, transports, I/O ports, security, etc.), so a sequel could do something similar. The script could basically write itself; back then, writers had one very difficult time trying to convey the inner workings of a computer network to an audience that was not as computer saavy as today (I'd say they sort of failed - TRON's weakest part was its story). Also, Disney couldn't just hire everyone; they weren't the powerhouse they are now, so they had to do with a scrappy team of visionary but amateurish people. Now, with $300 million dollars at their disposal, any actor they could ever want, all the technology they could ever need, Pixar and their creative team, how could Disney make Tron a failure?

If you want an answer to this question, just go watch Tron: Legacy. It IS a failure.

Why? I believe that TRON, as näive and silly as it sometimes is, has its heart in the right place - it always strives to tell a story, and uses technology as both a backdrop and a principal character. It's not technology for its own sake, either - the Lightcycles, tanks, recognizers, and the complete universe of Tron really made you feel as if you were somewhere else. It was completely unlike anything you had ever seen before. The art depicted on the movie was so striking I think it'll be remembered for years to come just because of it. And, as I said before, it correctly guessed at the future of computing. I wouldn't hesitate to call it a landmark movie, even considering all of its problems.

Tron: Legacy is just another product Disney marketing decided to sell. It has no soul whatsoever. It's not innovative or inventive - most of the things you'll see come from other, more successful movies. Examples? The aerial pursuit near the end of the movie is lifted directly from Star Wars. The bar scene is a near perfect copy of the one on Matrix: Reloaded. The attack scenes are also lifted from the Matrix. Jeff Bridges is The Dude in a cybercostume. The rebel kid hacking computers seems like a copy of Terminator 2. At no time did I think to myself "this is something I had never seen in my life", as I did with Tron.

Furthermore, there's no story of any importance whatsoever behind all the CGI. The original TRON dealt with issues we face nowadays in any computer network (well, at least if you are a geek and work with computers). Tron Legacy doesn't even make any effort to predict the future, or to point out at any risks technology poses to people in the XXIst century. It's a completely disposable product, which is sort of enjoyable when you watch it, but can't bear to think about it afterwards. Because it really makes no sense and it doesn't make any important points.

I cannot believe Disney couldn't get someone - anyone - capable of writing a good script, hiring decent actors (Sam Flynn was TERRIBLE) and getting a director with at least a couple of good movies under his belt. The only reason why I give this movie a 7 is because, even though you've seen everything before, it does look great on the big screen. I especially liked CLU - I never noticed I was looking at CGI. Awesome technology.

I'm completely positive this sequel will go down in history as others, such as Blues Brothers 2000, the Star Wars prequels, and Matrix: Revolutions as one of the worst ever made. Sad. It had so much potential it's incredible they actually blew it.

Tron Legacy is so bad, that if I had been in Jonestown and they were showing this film, I would have drunk the Kool-aid half way through the film to end my life.

The lines are so bad, the acting is borrowed from every blockbuster that was a success before this film (think Star Wars, Raiders, Attack of The Clones..etc.) the idea is, if they show you familiar themes with familiar frames and a music score that is supposed to be avant-garde but comes up sounding borrowed and repetitive. The Film wants to be Batman, and a video game at the same time, and it never makes sense. For a film that's about computers, the computers seem awfully stupid and the Users even more idiotic...

Save your money and see Yogi Bear at least that movie has no pretense.

Here's TRON: 

A Real cool guy driving around on his bike, living' on the edge cause "BOHOOO My father left me". He base-jumps from a skyscraper and...never mind.

I wanted to walk out of the theater at least 14 times. And additionally one time when a ninja-program took a back flip and landed the COOL way, looking down, then slowly looking up. F(/&#! Endless over choreographed fighting-scenes, programs eating a pig for dinner...At that point my synapses overloaded and i felt like that guy in clockwork orange. I wondered if these programs would fart after eating that pork. In this perfected universe they have guns that jams. And why do they have big hangars for planes that actually fits inside a small stick anyway. The universe, the plot, the whole premise is built on a retarded thought you had the first time you smoked weed. Where is this actually happening? On the hard drive? Or maybe in the RAM, driving on light-bikes into the CPU...as a program..not literally of course. There is no new thoughts in this movie at all. I knew what was going to happen in every scene, except in the end when The Dude shows he in fact has powers that bends all rules in this strictly programmed world, and sends out a Playstation-RPG-power surge and helps his moron son get back to reality "not without you daddy!! GO son..just GOOO!!" He holds his fathers memory-ring over his head, HE-MAN style, into the bright stream of ...binary light, and gets sucked out of the digital world just in time before the whole shite collapses. Close call!

I hate this movie for getting me to seriously consider shooting dirty street heroin into my veins just to forget about it. I will download the movie though, burn it on DVD, write some obscene stuff on it with a black marker pen, and then try to blow it up with firecrackers, if that fails i will simply burn it with a lighter and bury it.

I say this because he is the best part of this film. He is the only one who actually gives a performance worth watching and the only reason I gave it three stars instead of one. 

Now for the rest of this godawful mess: The first film had an actually interesting and sustainable premise, namely, a formerly free system, steadily being corrupted by an increasingly bloated AI Master Control Program, with dual protagonists in the form of the fish-out-of-water Flynn and the heroic security program Tron. The film dabbles with theology, philosophy, and the nature of existence without ever becoming ham-fisted or preachy, and, while flawed, manages to tell a cracking good story in (for the time) ground-breaking style.

Legacy, on the other hand, manages to take that once-sturdy premise and twist it into some sort of muddled Hitler allegory, with no clear motivations for the heroes *or* villains, no clear explanations for exactly why Clu went bad, and, most of all, no clear explanation for just what the hell Clu thought he was gonna do in the real world. I mean, he did know the light cycles and light jets and stuff wouldn't work, right? He did realize that bullets would be perfectly capable of killing his solidified programs, right? He did know that his plan was the most *idiotic plan in the history of idiotic plans, right*?!! 

Moving on to the extremely sloppy plotting, a sleazy chairman of the board and Ed Dillinger's son are introduced early in the film and never seen again. *Ed Freaking Dillinger*! Think about that for a minute. The son of the man whom Flynn presumably sent to prison at the end of the first film is introduced as working for the company of the man who sent his father to prison. He "fixes" something Flynn's son does as a (lame) prank, concocts a solution to the prank, and is *never freaking seen again*! This is only the first of many plot threads which are introduced and left unresolved in the finest Disney potboiler tradition.

I will not even get into the complete asspull represented by the "ISOs," whatever the hell they were, since I couldn't follow the gobbledy-gook Bridges was forced to spout in that scene. Let's just say that they're an anvilicious Jew analogy and leave it at that.

All of this complete mish-mash of utter crapola leads up to one of the worst, most anti-climactic endings in recent cinematic history. I took time out of the retching I was doing at Bridges' awful performance (one minute he's playing it straight, the next he's The Dude-- make up your mind and stick with one, willya?) to marvel at the sheer hateful lameness of this blatant sequel set-up.

There is so much more I could say about this waste of time, money, and opportunity, but I will end by saying that this film left my childhood memories like a Saturday night after Atilla the Hun hit town: raped and murdered.

First thing I want to say is that I was very annoyed that they only showed it in 3D at the theater. It was a waste of extra money: I kept my glasses off during the intro and when they were in the digital world I didn't really notice when it was 3D.

The story wasn't interesting. It was annoying that it hinted at the Holocaust and Hitler (or any other fascist leader, doesn't matter): "genocide" of the ISO's, one person leading the rest to "perfection". I didn't see why Clu would bother entering the real world. If he can send a page to someone in the real world, he might as well just hit the systems of countries or banks, whatever -- what Master Computer wanted to do in the original.

The characters were cliché and flat. It almost seems like movie makers take the same characters but put them in another jacket and story every time. There wasn't much dialogue and it still sucked. They used stupid one-liners you might've heard before. (Maybe not the exact same words, but the reaction to a certain situation, the way and the tone in which it is said is the same in a lot of movies.) Tron, or Rinzler didn't make sense to me. OK so, first he was a good program who believed in the users, then a while later in the New System CLU turns against Flynn/users and turned Tron into Rinzler. Rinzler's hunting down Sam, but then, in their...aerial pursuit.. he changes, goes "...I fight for the users!!" and crashes into Clu. Maybe I missed something, but I thought that was very random. (And why does his head whir?) The digital world itself was pretty wrong. You got that computer-feeling in the original Tron, but in Tron:Legacy it felt more like being on another planet. Dust blowing up, wind, curves, spilling blood (that drop), ... it all seemed wrong to me, because I always imagine a computer world to be more straight lines, 010101,pixel, etc.

I had the impression they were advertising in the movie as well. Ipad, Nokia, mascara, ... I wouldn't normally care, but it was obvious when one of those girls were staring at the camera for a second too long.

The only good thing about Tron: Legacy was the film score. Daft Punk did a great job! It really fit the idea and gave the right feeling. I still feel thrilled when I recall the intro of the movie. I almost wish they had just made the movie themselves, they would've done a better job.

I'm not surprised that Tron wasn't a good movie. It's obvious that it's just another dump Disney made purely for the money. The Disney from my childhood is pretty much dead now.

Anyway, if you haven't seen Tron: I wouldn't bother. Especially not if it's only in 3D; it's not worth the extra money. Unless you like Daft Punk and want to listen the music while eating eye candy.

For months now the mainstream film media have been building this up. To me it was an utter failure of combined elements that could have worked if they had only paid for a decent writer to make it at all interesting. 

I seriously expected so much more, if not from the plot then from the action sequences. The light cycle scene was cleverly updated but lacked any tension being placed so early on in the film - it was so obvious that the generic programmes would bite it and not at all exciting watching both Clu and Sam simply show their feathers a little only for a completely random previously un-introduced (and a bit lame) element to interfere (tension!!!)-. Then talking. Then dinner and talking. Then Micheal Sheen being a nonce. Then Talking. Then badly staged fight scene without anyone really knowing why. Then talking and sitting on a slow moving toilet brush, talking. Meditation. Then Clu turns into a motivational speaker. Bit more random fighting. Wheres the disc and why is it so important? Why? Then over long chase sequence which did look quite pretty. Then we realise just how spiritualistic Flynn has become for the 100th time. BlahBlah.

Avatar had cutting edge 3d special effects which fitted to the filmmakers priority of bringing the viewer into another world. Tron Legacy also has this priority. The difference: The world of Tron is a horrible, absurd place to have to stick your head into for 2 hours. 

I remember leaving the cinema after watching avatar depressed at how sad our world looks compared with pandora. I left the cinema laughing after tron legacy. And not especially interested in playing a computer game, ever again. Avatar was luckily supported by a half decent script and good acting. Tron fails in all of these areas.

Nothing in this film caught my interest other than my concern for Sam's adorable little dog and my unanswered wonder as to who is feeding him whilst Sam is in Tronland following the yellow brick road. 

And I have to say that the Jeff Bridges effects failed to impress me. I think the official terminology is Digital Botox and the human eye is yet to be tricked. In fact the closer the cgi boys get to realism the more annoying it is because it is uncomfortable to watch something of two worlds. Either way I don't know if Clu was supposed to express any charisma or not, I would say the effects ruined the performance of Bridges. Technological achievements like this are only valuable if they add something to the art of performance. In this case they were annoying gimmick.

I Don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially not younger children as it is dark without any sense to balance it out and far too confusing to be fun.

It's not highly likely to win many new converts, but for those who already like the original and want to see more of that world, it more than satisfies. The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in.

I was expecting a lot better. I WANTED it to be good.... They've had almost 30 years to get it right. I was very disappointed.

After watching this Im not sure 'Hollywood' knows how to write an original screenplay anymore. Especially when the characters/story is familiar with the audience. There was nothing in this film you wont have seen a dozen times. Done much better too.

They seemed to lose track of what the original concept was about and merged it with a kind of 'Matrix' style world. So programs didn't just have a function .... But they had a 'life' .... The moment Flynn walked into a 'bar/club' for programs i knew id had enough. I should've know that in the opening scenes when they used a computer generated Flynn to look younger i KNEW it was going to be bad! And it got worse and worse.

Direction, screenplay, score, acting, dialogue, effects ... All are well below par.

Even Jeff Bridges didn't bother to act. After watching True Grit I know he CAN act - he obviously had nothing to act WITH or was just picking up a pay check. Awful! But even Lightcycle race was uninspiring. I didn't think it was possible to ruin such a simple concept but they managed it.

One of the worst 'established' films in modern times. Because of the budget, cast and crew involved Im compelled to give this a 1/10 ... My first. Normally even turning up on set would get you more than this! Insulting to the the audience.

Is there ANYTHING good about the film? Yes. Eventually it ends.....

The sequel to Tron took the right approach to the marketing and went into effect a good year before the film came out. Recognising that many people (apart from real fans) will only have a hazy recollection of the film and will probably vaguely remember it as "good" but really only remember the iconic bikers and design of it all, the marketing focused on the updated design, bikes etc that make up this world. In every interview there was always a smattering of talk about father/son and comments made on the power and omnipresent nature of computers and networks but really it was the visual aspects of the film that were pushed to the front. So it was with the marketing, so it is with the film where we join the rebellious son of Flynn as he gets sucked into the grid and discovers that his father's dream has been corrupted by a clone programme of himself.

It is advisable to start with the world that has been created within this film because ultimately this is its main selling point. It looks great  faithful to the original creation but never feels dated by an old view of computing, it is a vibrant place and even some forced "places" (like a nightclub that makes it feel a little Cool World) don't hurt it beyond the bigger idea and feel. I saw it in 2D but the looming ships and bikes and such all worked well and looked great. The effects that produce a young Jeff Bridges are technically impressive and mostly they work well  it is only the very small movements of skin and face that don't convince but it is so good that, rather than "not working" it just looks like something is a little freaky with him. Although I'm not a massive Daft Punk fan, their soundtrack does work well and they fit the film well.

The film is mostly moved forward by this style and frequent action sequences; mostly this is enough and I did find it to be entertaining considering that I expected the 2 hour long film to drag once the novelty wore off after 15 minutes. The basic plot (get to the exit before the other guy does) is enough to provide room for action but not for characters. Occasionally we will get attempts at this and they kinda work just for that moment but not to make me care about the people/programmes. Hedlund is likeably athletic and that is what he brings to the role  not much in the way of performance but he fills the lead well enough. Bridges seems to be channelling the Dude for a reason I cannot totally understand and, although he is cool and effective in his roles, it isn't really a performance per se. Sheen hams it up in his brief moments while House's Wilde makes an appealing female programme even if she has nothing in terms of substance to offer.

Overall it is an effects film and in this regard it works very well, getting the style right in an engaging and slick manner that is all style. The substance is not really there to match it but if I'm being honest I didn't really miss it; mainly this was due to the style and action making up enough of the time and engaging me enough to not worry too much about not caring about anyone in the film. A hollow film then in many regards but it will be good looking enough to win over viewers despite this empty core.

Alright, I wasn't one of those guys going into this hoping to have a life changing, reliving of my childhood. Which is good, because I remember enjoying the original TRON as a kid, watching it with my computer programmer of a father who created the sci-fi nerd that I am today.

This is not a movie I would want my kids to remember. Yea sure, what everybody says about the special effects is true, it looked cool. But in my opinion, a movie has to do more than that. A movie needs a good story and/or good characters. T:L has neither.

Lets start with the story. Sweet boy who's father has gone missing becomes a rebellious young adult. (Feel like you've heard this one? It gets better). Gets cryptic clue about possible whereabouts of father. Finds father trapped in his own creation, rescue attempt begins. Yea...not that original. Add to that an awful attempt at a self-righteous moral that is pounded over your head more times than Mario swings his hammer at Donkey Kong. Add to that, techno babble that is completely unintelligible (I consider myself a relatively smart guy, so either I need to reassess that, or Jeff Bridges was spouting out nonsense for half the movie). Add to that huge plot holes and unfinished plot lines. Add to that an imaginary virtual world that doesn't even follow it's own rules. Vehicles that travel using light yet someone planes stall when flying vertically. Hint to the writers - SOMETHING WITHOUT A MOTOR CAN'T STALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Add to that ..... OK if you're completely annoyed with me by this point multiply by 100 and that is how annoying this story is.

Now the characters....let's see there's Flynn who can't seem to decide whether he's a hippie without a care, a zen Buddhist, or a hermit hiding from reality (well hiding form virtual reality).

Flynn's son Sam - the rebellious youth with something to prove who's dialog seemed to have been cut and paste from all those other rebellious youths with something to prove out there.

CLU - The creation of Flynn (and his identical image that doesn't age) that, following Flynn's command to create perfection, goes totalitarian, genocide and all. Cut and paste other megalomaniac dialog here.

Quorra - The girl with a bad side and a hidden secret (bum bum bum she's the last of her race that the above mentioned CLU has wiped out.....a race that "evolved" all by itself within the computer system (I think it'd be better if we skipped my rant on that but yes it is as ridiculous as it sounds) 

Zeus - the quirky bartender with a hidden agenda (bum bum bum he works for the bad guys) and yes this computer world has a bar requiring a bartender where programs go to drink I recommend visiting one yourself after this film and drinking enough to kill the brain cells remembering it.

And finally Tron - the character that the movie is NAMED AFTER. Tron has decided to work (unexplicably) for the bad guys, but does this in secret behind a mask under another name that I don't remember or care to look up. Until his final moment, when he (unexplicably) changes his mind and attacks said bad guy, screaming his only line "I FIGHT FOR THE USERS" and dies, without taking out said bad guy. My wife after watching the movie didn't even understand that it was supposed to be TRON. Some legacy.

All in all this film is just bad.

When my buddy and I went to see this movie we predicted about half of the things that happened in the movie. Plus everything happens so conveniently for the main character. He goes searching for someone and just happens to find on the street in about five seconds the one chick that can take him to that person, when he gets in trouble Cora just happens to burst in the knick of time out of the ceiling, etc. They might as well just have handed the main character victory. I thought this movie would be at least semi-original or have unexpected plot lines but it had none of these things. I literally almost fell asleep watching this movie.

The original Tron conveyed the, at this time very fresh, idea of a secret universe in the memory of a intelligent super computer with its technical possibilities of that time. The concept and execution was very innovative. 

The ingenious of the original movie was, to present the inside of a computer NOT from the user's point of view but from a perspective where the technical aspect determines the universe inside the machine. There were bits and bytes, RAM, CPU, data banks etc., a very technical and therefor nonhuman USER UNFRIENDLY and cold artificial environment. THAT made the inside of the machine so mysterious and interesting and menacing.

The makers of TRON legacy made the BIG and unforgivable mistake to present the inside of the machine just like the user is EXPECTING it. The machine looks like that it was designed to simulate a world which was programmed FOR the user, so that the users can orientate themselves better:

Hot chicks in wrinkled spandex, always fresh coiffed, characters have sprayed hairs, there is smoke, volume light, wind and atmosphere and completely digitized characters wear integral helmets with fogged visors when they breathe to heavy. Floors, walls are illuminated with neon tubes, materials like plastic, spandex, leather, which all sound like that, for instance, your hear the leather crumpling when the super cool characters move, the jets have engines with a fire boost, etc.. 

The irony of that movie is, that the artificial computer world seems more realistic than the real world: here, there exists in 1989 a portable laser powered by public electricity grid in Flynn's cellar which can scan living objects into a computer. Only 7 years back in the movies time frame, the same apparatus needed a f* huge whole building with a gigantic power reactor to function!! And now this thing is in Flynn's cellar, COME ON! BTW, the amount of data of a scanned human must be, at least, gigantic! BUT nobody at ENCOM never EVER realized that there is a huge memory leak since 21 years in their system! If that would not be enough, at the end of the movie, the portable laser is not only able to re-materialize a human BUT is also able to materialize a new life-form. 

Please tell me what a jerk Kosinski really is! Even if you never went to school or something, you might have heard of E=mc². The energy of generating 70 kg physical mass is roughly equivalent to the electric energy that 280 million households consume in a whole f* YEAR! This is double the energy of ALL US households consume! So WTF? 

What ruins the movie all the more, is the fact that nowadays every kid has a clear imagination about how the programmed world of a computer game should look like. To make this world louder, more colorful or bigger has a very limited effect not to mention that there is absolutely NO NEW experience (except the unbelievable amount of stupidity )to the audience. Even worse, this get's boring very fast. 

This movie is a totally exploitation of the original idea without any creativity of its own, actually it is very stupid and uninspired with endless boring dialogs and it is lacking anything of the visionary aspects of the original one. The acting is terrible, Garrett Hedlund is an underpants model not an actor. 

Obviously, the need to make the movie trendy and cool for generation PlayStation was the main directive for that poor execution. This movie is a parade example how an really incredible talentless and stupid hack and some business men without any fantasy can ruin a genius idea for ever.

This makes me sad!

There's a fairly coherent storyline here that would appeal across the spectrum, striking a fair balance between drama and action, although action junkies would have preferred for set action sequences given the investment in souping up and introducing a number of vehicles other than the light cycle.

Certain scenes stood out either as homage or influenced pieces, and perhaps you may disagree with me, but the nightclub scene with Gem the Siren (Beau Garrett) bringing our new protagonist Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges returns to once again play two roles, that of Kevin Flynn the founder of Encom and his digital creation / avatar Clu) to meet Castor (played by Michael Sheen with flamboyant spunk) an information broker in the undergrounds of the digital Grid world, seems to have contained a whiff out of The Matrix Revolutions, with Persephone and Merovingian. But of course the Wachowskis didn't have Daft Punk to turn the tables, and parallels between the Matrix and the Grid cannot be more prominent given entities within are programs, with the ones gone rogue instilled with a desire to cross over to the real world.

Then there's something unmistakably Star Wars about it too, with the designs of attack space crafts zipping through the night sky, and clearly one of the many gorgeous costumes here can't seem to hold a candle to what looked like an awesome robe, simple as it is, but striking nonetheless. Or how about something which reminds one of Gotham City's caped crusader, with the Tumbler inspired getaway vehicle with large inflatable tyres played out in a scene right out of Tim Burton's first Batman movie with the long road back to the secret hideout within which to seek out answers to questions left silent en route.

So I may be stretching it, but there will be certain degrees of familiarity you'll find in some moments of the story, but I assure you the crux of it is a film that has deeper pathos, dealing with man's relentless pursuit for perfection and utopia, and the desire to play god if given a chance. Creations made in the image of is quite pronounced in a scene that stood out almost like Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, although here it's interpreted in the digital realm. Humans aren't perfect, so our creations in all likelihood will inherit some of our flaws, no matter if they happen to be digital and following certain fixed patterns and constructs. It's what being human is all about with our imperfection. The dramatic elements here between Father and Son is the film's strength to provide that emotional anchor and attachment making this a digital affair with plenty of soul, and the chemistry shared between Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund make them quite the father and son pair up, with shades of how revered the former is within his own created realm, and the tremendous power that he still holds even if in exile.

Olivia Wilde provides for the token fashionista who is ever ready to flex her battle prowess with skills in various weapons - a lethal combination of The Matrix's Trinity equipped with Star Wars blades - and vehicles, whose background is given a superficial twist which seeks to expand the TRON universe a little bit more with miracle phenomenon being a natural occurrence once a perfect equilibrium is achieved. Fans will get to learn and understand this expanded universe a lot more as explanations get dished out in due course, even one that deals with the time in between the first and second films, of Kevin Flynn's obsession with his latest playground that his creation ultimately took over, turning it into an arena with its own brand of gladiatorial fights for entertainment. But there's enough material introduced without being overwhelming for the new Grid entrant, and opens up a lot more avenues for future storytellers.

Even for those days, I wasn't one of those who got instantly impressed by the effects of the time, but then again that's what made TRON stand out based on its uniqueness in look. It was way ahead with combining live action with computer generated graphics, and in the same fashion, the filmmakers here had done an admirable job prepping this film up for 3D. 3D may be the latest Hollywood fad that got people jumping onto its bandwagon, but just as how computer graphics has to be inherent in the first TRON movie, the updates of the franchise has to keep up with the times, and in true reel mimicking real life, The Grid pops up in more than 2 dimensions, starting with the light cycle wars that include an additional dimension to consider, which makes for some thrilling action, both on or under the ground and in the air, rather than just becoming a mere special effect.

But I had to admit my personal hook line and sinker to watch this film, is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. It stands out most definitely throughout the film, and provided additional lift. It's a character in itself without which the film wouldn't be half as exciting or watchable, with rousing themes to stoke your expectations with its pomp. Their musical contribution and its importance cannot be more than overstated, and is a critical ingredient to why I had enjoyed this film so much to put it as a late consideration into one of the best this year has to offer.

I have to say that I saw the 3D version and I hate to say it but this has to be the worst movie that I have seen this year, the visual effects are very bright very spectacular but that is it; If you are into light shows this is the movie for you; because that is all you'll get; if you wanted a movie with substance THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU; IT WAS THAT BAD AND I'm NOT KIDDING; I was stunned at just how stupid this movie was there is not and I mean no plot line Walt Disney has sunk to new lows; It was not worth the $11.00 per ticket to see this B Flick.

The plot was terrible along with the acting; this movie lacked vision and substance you get pushed from one bad scene to another and it does make me sad to give this film a bad rap but it was not worth sitting through all of the bad acting just to see the light show and CG effects. It surly does not live up to the original vision of Tron and as a follow on film I would say don't waste your time and money because there are other films playing now that are worth both time and money

I like the first Tron. Not in an creepy over-obsessed way, but I regard it as a campy, retro glitterfest based on an delightfully silly idea. The basic concept stays the same in Tron Legacy. Computer programs are sentient beings inside the computer grid, probably deriving from the fact that they are created from someone's hope and dreams and therefore inherit some of their creators (or "users")soul. 

In the first Tron a "user", Flynn/Jeff Bridges, is whisked away into the computer world (by lasers, no less). In "Legacy" the son of Flynn is looking for his father 20 years after he strangely disappeared without a trace. No price for guessing where, and we also find ourselves in the computer world after a quite glum and outstretched intro. FINALLY.

Turns out the world inside is equally glum. Now, with the way the use of computer have evolved and increased dramatically since the last movie I was expecting to see a grid teeming with all sorts of life and variety. That may be my mistake. I realize that the world in Tron Legacy may in fact be the sole creation of one being (Flynn/Jeff Bridges) with no interaction with the rest of the world, which may be plausible,given the theme of the movie, but still. Flynn copy/paste a lot and is obviously very fond of the "dark-gritty-stone-tool".

All that aside, there been notables upgrades in the Tron world. Most technology looks, well, cooler. It is stunning visually, especially in 3d. My biggest gripe with the movie though is how clunky everything is. This should be a rendition of the world inside a computer, but stuff hisses, creaks and spew exhaustion. When did the digital world turn so analogue? Sure, from a scientific point of view the digital is indistinguishable from the analogue if it is complex enough, but why does it feels like a step backwards? The world in the older movie actually feels like a much more accurate rendition of a computer world than this. The new one is more like reality with fancy neon. Flynn turns his personal abode into a reality shrine, and eating what I guess is a virtually crafted pig, but that is him emulating reality. The motor of the first movie was that we could see games and programs run "as if it was in real life". With todays graphics that is already happening on-screen so the movie might have outlived its gimmick. If so there are more than enough other features from the digital world worthy of being represented in Tron. Why just demote the whole world then?

I realise I haven't said anything about the acting. Well, there is none. Bridges tries his best to put some personality into Flynn. Not an easy task. Most of the time he just seems awkward. Our protagonist, whats-his-face, Sam is the sulky and estranged techno-wizz-kid we have all seen so many times before, only a bit older this time (27). The Tron from the title is there naturally, and he does... nothing. Boxlietner is in the cast, why not let him give old Tron a line at least? In the male world of computers there are as many as two female actor, but they are just the standard blockbuster version of the madonna/whore, aka spunky and bitchy. That boils down to sourpuss, hippie, spunky, bitchy, a creepy game-character and oh, there is also a Bowie, although not thee Bowie. Hello Disney, NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING SOME DIMENSIONS TO YOUR CHARACTERS, AND I DO NOT MEAN 3D, OK?

Frankly, I'm thoroughly annoyed, and though not expecting much also surprisingly disappointed. Ah, well. The 4/10 is for looks, sounds and effort. It do look nice and the soundtrack is marvellous at times. I'm convinced that the musicians Daft Punk would make a better version of Tron themselves AND with more heart.

In a sentence: Go watch the original. Unlike this sterilized computer generated FX production, it has a soul, and a script.

I had high hopes for TRON Legacy to rise above the many FX/3D releases that seem to flood the theaters lately. Afterall, TRON harnessed computer generated graphics nearly 30 years ago- and at that time, it was ground breaking. But now? sure, the graphics are improved, but so is every similar FX assisted production since 1982. Computers are faster, designers have more cpu power to play with, and 3D projection systems finally hit it right. But what about everything else that makes a movie? like.. a plot?

Sadly, TRON is just another casualty of eye candy. Whether it is the sublime virtual world which rehashes 28 year old ideas infused with modern pixel engines, or the pretty and naive Ms. Wilde tucked in her tights and serving as the Megan Fox of Tronville- TRON does not fly. It grudgingly crawls through a plot that is as expected and transparent as government propaganda: there's good, there's bad, there's conflict, and there's the evident triumph of good over evil. In the way, we meet characters which serve no point, have neither depth nor lifespan, and have nothing but to provide except for additional FX opportunities. 

TRON closely follows the footsteps of AVATAR: a technological demo with a script that can fit in a brochure. Stunningly boring.

The ultimate star of the show, Bridges, tries hard but can't pull the plot on his own. Once in a while, he utters a notable comment with a hint of Big Lebowski which draws a few smiles, but has no one else in the cast to play with. Wilde plays a sexy role muttering a 3rd grader script, while Hedlund's role is the juvenile irresponsible punk with Brad Pitt and Robin Hood aspirations- leaving zero aftertaste. The only other memorable actor (besides Bridges) is Michael Sheen, which we're blessed with for far too few moments. Blame Disney for that choice.

Tron Legacy is a waste of time. 28 years ago, Tron felt as if it had been brought back from the future. The new incarnation is technology demo, with sprinkles of Bridges and a remarkable sound track. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.

If you like shapes that move around a bit, predominantly neon blue, but some of them orange, and just a few halfway between orange and yellow, then THIS is the movie for YOU! Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund star in this scintillating cutscene, I mean MOVIE, as father and son reunited through their shared passion for Pong. Olivia Wilde walks up and down a bit, perhaps three or four times, and also lounges on a sofa in one scene. As for "young" Jeff Bridges, I always long to see filmmakers embrace and celebrate the wonders of uncanny valley, and I can assure you his scenes did NOT disappoint. If you, like me, find that you can't wait three years for your next fix of Tron magic, maybe get two lava lamps, stick them to the lenses of your 3D glasses and stumble around in a nightclub toilet saying pew pew pew wubbawubba bass bing bang bong, the grid, x axis, y axis, ooh look the portal, I love you son, I love you dad, squeeeeee!!!!! and then collapse in a pool of your own vomit - oh no, I've given away the plot. Pfftt...
