### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
A brilliant funny movie that still respects the sadness that happens in life but tries to show you that fun and laughter can still be our main focus. 

I think this is the best so far of Taika Waititi's films and recommend it to anyone to see. I saw it after a long-tiring week at work and I half expected to nod off in the cinema theatre because I was so tired. But I didn't. I laughed and chuckled most of the way through the film and came away re-energized and very happy I had gone. 

Would see again if the opportunity came up, which is likely as most of my friends are raving about it and a few are wanting me to go with them to see it again!

Taika Waititi is starting to make some real waves in the film making industry. It's as simple as this - every film he makes, people like. In fact, people like them so much he's been trusted with the directorial duties in the next 'Thor' film 'Thor: Ragnarok'. That's big and shows people trust him with making their film. That decision was made prior to the release of 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' but I can confirm that this film will do his reputation no harm. In fact it's going to do it a lot of good. It's a very fine film and in my opinion his best yet. 

I thoroughly enjoyed 'What We Do in the Shadows' but my one qualm with it was I felt it lacked a story to drive the humour. The man learns from his errors fast though and there is no such problem here. The story, while simple, is a driving force and makes sure things never get mundane or boring. Also helping this is a terrific cast of actors. Julian Dennison in the lead role blew me away and showed comedic timing far beyond his years. Sam Neill was as fantastic as ever and every cameo throughout is terrific and hilarious in its own way. 

The film not only manages to make us laugh though, it also has a heart. There are some very sad and moving elements to the film which are handled exquisitely by Waititi. He makes us think and sobers us occasionally but never takes us away from the fun time we're having with the story. There's a lot more to the film than I expected going in. It has layers and works on a lot of levels. I can't say enough good things about this film. An absolute pleasure to sit through.

I saw this movie last night in Hokitika. There was a queue outside, which caused comment enough amongst the locals, as this never happens. The cinema was packed with an amazing demographic of people, for example, on one side of me were toddlers with their Mums, on the other a lone hunter-type and behind me a group of retired farmer ladies. I think this speaks volumes on the draw of this film. To put it simply, it ticks all the right boxes. Everyone in Aotearoa (NZ) will know these characters in some form or another; from the gruff old bushman, to the earthy mother figure and the chillaxed cop. It is that familiarity that makes it more engrossing and funny. But not just here, its mix of subtle bathos and pathos will make it universally appealing, of that I am certain. In short: Good on ya, Taika! 'Marvellous' film!

While Taika Waititi takes over Hollywood with his next two projects: THOR 3: RAGNORAK (2017) and a sequel to his funniest film to date WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS (2014), hysterically entitled WE'RE WOLVES, his latest "little film that could" should put Sam Neil back on the map with a wonderfully gracious performance.

This magical realist New Zealand adventure drops an unloved, rebellious, little fat kid into the wild, wild southwest  and I'm here to say that this was the feel good film of Sundance this year. Luckily writer/director Waititi has held onto his unique dry-humor, which dates back to his debut feature EAGLE VS. SHARK (2007) as well as his underrated second film BOY (2010). But this krazy kids flick is not just satisfied with referencing all of the 1980s films its creator grew up loving: The movie itself is an actual throwback to the kind of children's fare that were laced with some very heavy adult issues like Walter Murch's RETURN TO OZ (1985) and Nicolas Roeg's THE WiTCHES (1990). Make sure to catch this truly loving film upon its initial theatrical release. It's the kind of experience that you'll be talking about years from now, perhaps even sharing with children of your own.

This is such a funny, heartwarming, immensely entertaining, brilliant film for the whole family. I can't wait to go again, and again.... Taika is a genius. The entire cinema clapped when it finished which I've never seen before. It's now my absolute favourite film of all time!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!!!!!! It is effortlessly funny with a brilliant cast of very talented Kiwi actors. The scenery is of course beautiful because it's set in New Zealand's stunning landscape. Even though there are serious, universal underlying issues within the script they are dealt with in a way that is from the child's innocent perspective so the film remains light and entertaining throughout. If this film doesn't do exceptionally well off shore and get the global recognition it deserves, it will be a travesty.

Beautiful story of survival, family and humor, Amazing Cinematography and relatable lovable characters. This film places deep characters and themes in a beautifully visual setting of New Zealand while making it hilariously funny and giving the right amount of action, thought-provoking situations and dialogue to make it a perfect film, Using every possible opportunity to give the audience an emotional and visual pleasure. 

The film covers so many aspects of developing emotions while delivering a heart touching laugh your ass off story and never letting the audience either laughing or awing for the story of this cute parent-less fat boy and his journey of running,hiding and surviving though the unique NZ bush and connection to his uncle Heck.

The film allows the audience to leave with the most satisfyingly developed characters and story, while becoming a instant classic and a great showcase of New Zealand as a Country and its potential in the Film Industry.

I consider this to be the best film By Tiki Waititi and there is no wonder why he the writer and director has been chosen to direct the anticipated Thor: Ragnarok of the superhero film genre taking over Hollywood.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was excellently developed and had the perfect cast. 10/10 would see again. It had the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I laughed, I cried. Every component of it was thought out in detail and it worked perfectly! Even while it was funny, it had an overall meaning and made you consider different aspects of society. To be entirely honest, when I first heard what it was about, I wasn't interested but it is now one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. Please, if you have the chance to see it, you must. I guarantee you, you won't regret it. There was absolutely no part where I thought "well, this could have been better" or "that could have been excluded", it was so so good. From the cinematography to the cast and script, it was perfect, I couldn't have asked for a better movie.

It's too hard to fault Taika Waititi; he's excellent at what he does, and this movie is surely his best yet. The story has serious matters at its heart, and yet it managed to stay well above maudlin at all times, being moving and downright hilarious most of the time.

Also a great spotlight once again on New Zealand's native bush, with many great little nods to Kiwi movies of years gone by. The leads, Sam Neill & Julian Dennison, are wonderful in their roles, and the supporting cast were not far behind. 

So much a Kiwi movie and one for all ages, yet it's humour and story will definitely appeal beyond our shores. Go and see it now!

This movie is really good - I have to say I enjoyed it and would probably see it again.

A far more developed example of what Waititi can do as a director and storyteller; the film has examples of pathos, comedy, action, drama, art film, satire, good cinematography and even a few decent VFX shots. His last film, vampire mockumentary "What We Do in the Shadows" was a narrative disappointment, despite NZ media committing to expose the film and help generate sales. Something of a misguided indulgence, "Shadows" made the mistake of letting three or four (very) minor indie celebs improvise in digital for many, many hours, then the director tried to create a concrete whole in editing and post. Didn't work. Great intro though.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople focuses on the life of Ricky Baker - a young, overweight, orphaned juvenile offender that idealizes hip hop and creates haiku poetry as a method of externalizing emotional conflict, due to the influence of counseling and therapy sessions. Stuck in New Zealand's sub-par youth welfare system (known for endless governmental restructuring with little or no substantive improvement), Ricky ends up on a rotting farm somewhere in the rural back blocks with foster parents. 

The film clearly shows elements of the barren, social realist film of early 80s NZ, but with bigger, better cinematography, and Waititi's indie sense of the quirky and offbeat. "Quirky" can become a meaningless attribution in today's market of indie features where anybody and everybody can have a go at being "quirky" to make up for budget and spectacle, but this film also has real nuance and character development, and a quality cast that seem to get the idea of being a bit "quirky" and "meta" without forgetting that emotional investment is what an audience really needs to feel involved with the story. Rachel House is hilarious. So's the director in an excellent cameo.

Some of the early scenes don't read as naturally as they could, and also Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne's mother in the film is referred to but is never actually seen for unknown reasons. In addition, New Zealander's might complain about the films location improbabilities, but that's been standard practice in US features for years. Cool movie!! Go see it!!

Kiwi director Taika Waititi of "Boy" and "What We Do In the Shadows" fame will shortly be stepping into the big leagues directing the next "Thor" movie.

In the meantime he has conjured up another slice of real Kiwi life on a budget that would probably fail to cover the catering bill for his new movie. Waititi translates Kiwi writer Barry Crump's book into a screenplay full of Kiwiana, irony and humour.

We meet Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) as the local police (Oscar Kightley) and "enthusiastic" Child Care worker "Paula" (Rachel House), attempt to rehouse the young Maori lad with his new adoptive foster parents. "Aunt Bella" (Rima Te Wiata), child loving and with a heart of gold together with husband "Hec" (Sam Neill), a loner bushman with little desire to house a young delinquent.

Ricky's long list of offences are mentioned, including "smashing stuff and throwing rocks" but Paula is very determined, oft repeating her personal motto, "no child left behind".

The opening scene sets the tone perfectly, as Ricky carefully surveys his new accommodation and quietly returns to the police car.

Despite finding his new basic rural surroundings somewhat bewildering, including a gloriously bloody wild pig hunt, Ricky starts to become part of the family as he is showered by Aunt Bella's practical love and understanding.

Following an event, Ricky and Hec strike out on their own into the New Zealand bush as a national man hunt for the pair commences. Can they get on, will Hec's heart eventually melt, if indeed he can find it? This is a comedy drama with emphasis on the humour with incompetent hunters, crazy bushmen (Rhys Darby) and comical situations. However framed with underlying sadness and a serious story under pinning the whole endeavour. The tone is reminiscent of director Waititi's' "Boy" and manages to stay consistent throughout. Waititi even allowing himself a brief cameo, to great comedic effect.

There are plenty of belly laughs for those that understand and know New Zealand well. Neill essaying your everyday "she'll be right" Kiwi bloke, whilst providing a much needed straight man to all the shenanigans.

Some scenes are pushed too far, with Paula's quest going to ridiculous length's for the sake of comedy and Darby overbalancing his scenes with his usual shtick. Somehow with the solid anchor of Dennison's fresh performance and Neill's experience, the ship manages to stay the right way up.

The New Zealand bush is shown in all it's glory with the addition of a great choral track to accompany the shots of the overhead tree canopy.

Overall a much more approachable and enjoyable film than "Shadows" which will play especially well with Kiwi's and Australians but does have broader appeal. 

Summary 

Hugely enjoyable comedy adventure with serious undertones and represents a real return to form for Waititi. It's also good to see Sam Neill on the big screen again, opposite a great new young talent.

Oak Cliff Film Festival 2016 Greetings again from the darkness. It just doesn't seem very many movies are designed to be funny to a wide range of viewers. There are raunchy comedies for taboo lovers. There are comedies for young kids. There are even Nicolas Cage movies for unintentional laughs. But writer/director Taika Waititi actually delivers a thoroughly entertaining movie that will generate laughs across multiple generations  it's quite simply, a fun time at the theatre.

It's based on the 1986 book "Wild Pork and Watercress" by Barry Crump, who himself is a bit of a legendary figure in New Zealand. The film begins with Child Protective Services (or whatever it's called in New Zealand) dropping off 12 year old Ricky Baker to his new foster family. Paula, the CPS agent, considers Ricky a lost cause and describes him as "a very bad egg" as she rattles off his list of previous rebellions to new foster mom Bella, who takes note of Ricky's heft with a couple of wisecracks  delivered with a well-meaning smile.

In a terrific screen introduction, "Uncle" Hec slowly comes into frame flashing a world class scowl and a wild boar slung over his shoulder. Ricky continues his habit of running away at night, but Bella slowly wins him over with her kindness, understanding and breakfast offerings. A tragic occurrence and fear of being shipped back to the juvenile center, has Ricky disappearing into the New Zealand bush. Soon enough Hec catches up and the two begin a relationship that is the core of the film.

Rima Te Wiata plays Bella as a perpetually optimistic woman with a sincere drive to help Ricky adjust and find some joy in life. Sam Neill plays Hec in full grumpy curmudgeon mode  a nice compliment to the extraordinary presence of Julian Dennison (Paper Planes) as Ricky. Ricky and Hec together are a hoot to watch. It's not simply the generational differences, but also a clash of one man who wants little more than to be left alone and a young boy who wants little more than to be noticed and cared about. It's not so much the direction of their relationship that surprises, but rather the manner in which it develops.

Director Waititi's next film is Thor: Ragnarok, so this makes us appreciate even more his pleasant little indie film that features not just colorful and interesting characters, but the beautiful landscape of the New Zealand bush  much of which we see during the humorous manhunt for Hec and Ricky. It's a farcical comedy with a dose of profundity and loads of adventure for two social misfits. Rachel House is pretty funny as the obsessed CPS worker, and Rhys Darby ("Flight of the Conchords") is downright hilarious as Psycho Sam. Watching criminial-wannabe Ricky literally count off his Haiku, leaves little doubt as to why this one has been such an "audience favorite" at multiple film festivals.

What a disappointment! I was expecting a quirky, but down to earth, charming drama with comedic elements and an engaging story to be enjoyed by young and old. The first 10 -15 minutes are overall promising but it is generally downhill from there. Initially I had no intention of seeing this film as the posters looked as if the film was essentially aimed at kids and it holds a 12A classification. In retrospect the publicity got it right! However, the reviews on IMDb, the comments, reputation of the writer/director and overall score of 8.3 convinced me otherwise. Unfortunately the story is formulaic and offered no originality on the central theme of a 'damaged' child who finds friendship and meaningful relationship with caring adults after various events. The acting at times was clunky from the central young character and other minor roles as was the dialogue on many occasions. The humour was derived from too many forced situations and the peripheral characters became increasingly unbelievable and the overall feel just juvenile and very childish. There were several incongruent bloody scenes involving animal slaughter which simply felt unnecessary when sitting along side the more silly story arcs. The scenery was indeed spectacular but the characters' placement on extreme peaks at times was totally unbelievable and done simply to showcase the background. The last 30 minutes became predictable, mawkish and there are a ridiculous series of events which are aimed at creating laughs at the expense of any credibility. I think this is an overall miss as the level of humour and plot could only be appreciated by uncritical 8 - 11 year old's who it is not primarily aimed at! This review may seem harsh but is needed to counterbalance all the OTT positive reviews whose motivation for such praise is perhaps questionable. It is a 6/10 but I have voted 5/10 to offer some counterbalance.

"Hunt for the Wilderpeople" seems like your run-of-the-mill movie about kid with problems that connects with older person, and then both of them learn how to understand each other and how to deal with the whole wide world.

And it is.

But it is much more than that.

Directed by Taika Waititi (whose other work also offers the same kind of humour), "Hunt for the Wilderpeople" may not be a very original movie, but it is a movie with heart and lots of comedy and silliness that never overstays its welcome. If you don't laugh, at least you will be smiling throughout the whole affair, feeling a connection to Neill's Faulkner and Dennison's Baker, two of those characters that are so easy to relate to, one bitter and old and the other bitter and young.

The script keeps things fast and loose, the jokes coming, and all under a clear patina of surrealism. The direction is assured and never let things get out of hand. But the best is the acting. Sam Neill has never been better, and Julian Dennison shines. But all the cast does an amazing job.

It is tonally uneven in a couple of places, and it takes a couple of strange decisions, but those are minor quibbles in a very funny and heartfelt movie.

Totally recommended.

Those familiar with writer-director-actor Taika Waititi's last three films  What We Do in the Shadows, Boy and Eagle vs Shark  already know how bloody brilliant the New Zealand native is both behind and in front of the camera. If there is any justice in the world then his most recent Kiwi adventure, which maintains the ridiculously high standard he has set, will attract big crowds and greatly expand the number of people fortunate enough to watch this master at work. This charming tale of a rambunctious orphaned kid (Julian Dennison) trying to find his place in life, and in the NZ wilderness where his latest foster carers reside, beautifully blends cartoonish humour and meaty themes into its fascinating story. Adept at finding both poignancy and hilarity in the simple moments, Waititi's observations on culture, relationships and human behaviour draw you in to his world, which is all too real yet somehow heightened at the same time. Populated with subtly compelling characters whom you want to hang out with, laugh with, cry with and struggle through life with, the 101 minute runtime utterly flies by; when the end credits roll you'll not be ready to leave. Acting alongside screen veteran Sam Neill (outstanding  obviously) for the most part, the absurdly charismatic Dennison is an absolute revelation too, looking completely at ease filling the shoes of defiant 13-year-old Ricky Baker. Hopefully many more roles are forthcoming. At times hilarious, at times heartbreaking, and always enthralling, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a gem of a movie that verifies Waititi is a filmmaking genius.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople was one of my top movies at Sundance. The film used symbolism expertly. The director was able to convey powerful symbolism through something as small as a rubber water container. It was used as a symbol for home. It showed that in a harsh world full of rejection, what we all really want as humans is to be loved and wanted by other people. This movie shows that even though people can have a hard time trusting others with themselves, relentless love can break down barriers. In the movie, Ricky shows us that even though being truly loved by someone can feel foreign and awkward, once you get a taste of it, you never want to let it go. Through the rubber water container symbol, the film shows that when life circumstances change, we still just want intimate relationships with other people. Although it may appear different on the outside, it will always be similar at its core. 

This movie also shows how much our pasts want to dictate our future. We see outcasts of society searching for freedom from who they were, but how people around them are trying to not let that happen. Where they find the most freedom is exactly where society is trying to rip them out of. They would rather keep in the lowest levels of civilization rather than let them have their freedom. Just like with these characters, the world will identify us most by the things we least like about ourselves. Whether it is an addiction, or a mistake we would rather forget, these are the things the world continually wants us to live in rather than finding freedom from them. It is a fight to live in that freedom rather than being dragged down to believing we are still those same people from our pasts. This film shows that freedom is possible. No matter what is in our past, that does not have to be who we are today, but it is a battle. We will have to run, fight, or go against what people around us are telling us to do, but we must seek to live in that freedom. This film is fraught with other symbols and social commentaries. It is at the top of my list of recommendations for people to see.

Taika Waititi's new comedy, set in the New Zealand bush, sees the wacky manhunt of a young orphan, Ricky (Julian Dennison), and his foster uncle Hec (Sam Neil). Following the threat of returning to the public system, Ricky flees his new remote farm home, with his foster uncle tracking him down shortly after deep within the bush. With the authorities believing their disappearance to be kidnapping, both Ricky and Hec quickly become fugitives running from the law.

Waititi's excellent brand of comedy doesn't disappoint, with solid character based humour and genuine laugh out loud moments throughout. If you're a fan of Edgar Wright you're sure to enjoy the visual comedic style of the movie, as well as the levity and frivolity, which isn't too dissimilar to that seen in Wright's cornetto trilogy.

Casting is solid with the partnership between Neil and Dennison producing some excellent chemistry; well balanced by the comical partnership of unrelenting and headstrong child-services worker Paula (Rachel House) and incompetent police officer Andy (Oscar Kightley).

Hunt for the Wilderpeople is dumb from beginning to end. For starters, the child protagonist is still just as obese after 4 or more months in wilderness survival mode. Maybe the director thought that was absurdist humor, but I thought it was just stupid, and even felt angry that the director would use the boy's obesity as a comedy vehicle. The acting of the woman who plays that Social Services woman is atrocious. Sam Neill acts like he wishes he were somewhere else. The writing is poor. The film is rarely funny...too many flat gags and witty exchanges that are not witty. Much does not ring true about this film, from stilted conversation to contrived, silly scenarios that wouldn't even be charming in a fantasyland. Clichés abound, like the wild boar being shot by the boy just before it attacks then plopping down dead right in front of him. There's even an American-style car chase with a police car flipping over. Loved the New Zealand landscape though, and since it is ever-present throughout the film, and because I liked Rhys Darby's performance as Psycho Sam, I give Hunt for the Wilderpeople 5 stars.

I do love Taika Waititis movies and I totally dig his style. I also think he is a very talented and unique movie-maker. I liked "Wilderpeople", but in my opinion it was not as strong as Boy or What we do in the shadows. 

I feel that his off-beat low key style went a little too far this time, so that as an audience I lost emotional connection with the story and characters a few times. The flow of the movie was not as good as in Shadows or Boy, and with this style of movie, the right flow is very important. Also, it felt at times that the style was prevailing over the content. 

It is interesting that even though the story line in What we do in the shadows was even more fragmentary, it somehow worked there. And even though Shadows had a also a very unique styling it never felt like forced or artificial. 

Also I thought that the dogs in the film were totally unnecessary. They did not add anything to the story and the way they were filmed created the feeling of dis-continuity. In some scenes the dogs appeared and in others seemed to have disappeared forever. Then again they appeared erratically as if the director suddenly had remembered: "Blimey, i had the dogs a few scenes ago, I need to show the ears or the tail for continuity. "

Having said that, overall Wilderpeople was still a positive movie experience. All characters were funny and likable, even the evil social services inspector. The kid who played the main role was simply wonderful and so cute. Sam Neil as "uncle" and actress who played "auntie" did great job as well. I loved the cinematography, the intentional bending rules of "good" cinematography, the New Zealand-specific details in peoples homes, etc. 

I admired the unique and quirky cinematography already in the Shadows, and here Waiti continues serving an intentionally off-beat strange and wonderful cinematography. 

Also I liked the idea - two free spirits, outcasts of the society against the heartless and bureaucratic system. I loved that in the end the kid and the uncle were reunited in a straight forward happy end fashion. Even though the film had some flaws, definitely would recommend it as another example of talented and unique Taika Waititis work and also showcasing some wonderful NZ actors. 

Ups, almost forgot:besides the leads, auntie and social inspector one of the best characters is the wild bush man, played by the funnyman whose name always escapes me but he was the leader of verwolves in What we do in the shadows (Remember "We are the verwolves, not the swear-wolves"?)

I chose this movie because it is 8/10 on IMDb with 18,000+ votes and consistently good user reviews. 

Now that I've watched the movie there is obvious bias across most of the reviews. You'll see review titles like: "I find it impossible to fault", and "Perfectly Beautiful and Hilarious" nope nope nope.

I watched this movie and it was not that funny. There are no parts that I laughed, only some smiles at cute moments.

I lost interest many times. Acting was terrible at times, weak plot. many many actions were unjustified.

This movie should be 5 or 6 out of 10. Because of the tilted reviews, my expectation of this movie was much higher than what it was. Perhaps if the movie had proper reviews, I would've watched it with a different expectation.

They don't make movies like this one anymore where plot and character building and relationships take centre stage. Also where sequential explosions and CGI can render the viewer's senses numb in even the mini blockbuster nowadays, there is a charming sentiment that Taika Waititi brings to every one of his films. He injects it in almost every scene for Hunt for the Wilder People. It is the laid back humour where you have to listen carefully or you'll miss the subtle jokes that keeps you involved. The plot is simple, but realistic especially about how humans interact with each other and the impressions they leave behind. 

The cast is very gifted, from the experienced and amazing Sam Neill, to newcomers such as Julian Dennison and Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne. Kiwi talent is inexhaustible and unique. The story explores a few of life's issues such as bureaucracy, teenage pregnancy and mental health just to mention a few. And for those who like action, there is also a heart stopping high speed car crash scene. 

This is a special movie where it will make you chuckle at some rude jokes to bringing some tears to your eyes or just marvel at the beauty of NZ nature. But it will definitely make you think about a lot of things, from the past to the present. It's good in a way that there are so many predictable trilogy blockbusters with lacklustre story lines out there and coming soon. It's when you stumble across movies like Hunt for the Wilder People it really brings you back to the truly important issues in life and the people in it. However, don't despair. As Waititi intended, life is more tolerable when you laugh through it.

O, my goodness, I wasn't expecting this at all, I seriously thought HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE was going to be your usual predictable story about an orphan who looks up to an older man as his father figure. But the level of brutal honesty coming from all the characters is just off the charts. This is hands down, one of the funniest movies of the year, I couldn't stop laughing.

Writer/director Taika Waititi who gave us "Flight of the Conchords," and "What We Do In The Shadows" is back with this story set in his origin place of New Zealand where a defiant city kid named Ricky (Julian Dennison) finds himself at a home of a new foster family, an aunt that actually cares for him and Uncle Hec (Sam Neill) who'd rather be left alone. But a tragedy strikes which motivates Ricky and Hec to go on the run while a national manhunt ensues and brands them outlaws.

HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE is absolutely hilarious, calling it a crowd-pleaser is spot on, no better way to describe it. And as I said earlier, the characters in this film are brutally honest, there's no holding back and the comedy lies in this huge case of misunderstanding. But deep down, the kid just wants to be part of a family that for once wouldn't quickly give up and leave him out to dirt at the first sign of trouble. I've never read Barry Crump's book which was the basis for this film, but I'm guessing Waititi saw something in that story that resonates because we all want to fee like we belong somewhere; we don't want to feel like some kind of vagabond or a stray. So despite the fact that this kid, Ricky, is hard to deal with and he'll make anyone frustrated, you can tell that he's just an angry and scared teen and when you look at him from that perspective, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE will leave a lasting impression in addition to it being ridiculously funny. The things that Ricky says and does, you'll be laughing out loud till it hurts. Julian Dennison is a revelation, I hope he gets more gigs from this point forward.

Taika Waititi has pretty much solidified his position as the king of casual comedy - the sort of humour that comes from natural, believable and organic situations. The genius is partly with the editing team too, they have perfect comic timing!

At the core of the movie are the characters. Julian Dennison as Ricky is fantastic - a foster kid with behavioural issues, he soon warms to his new mother, Rima Te Wiata. She's fresh, funny and likable, which makes the tragedy of her death all the more impactful. It's then up to Sam Neill to keep the boy out of too much danger. The movie centres around their relationship, through the ups and downs of life in the wilderness. Their individual performances are great, but the real beauty is their bond.

Waititi's writing is genius too, enough humour to make the movie enjoyable, but with character depth to make it emotive. My main fault with the film is that it didn't quite have enough of either. That said, the simplistic and quirky music fits with the brilliant cinematography (with some Wes Anderson-esque camera positioning) to make the movie light and fun, with just a touch of sentimentality. Good job!

'HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE': Four Stars (Out of Five)

A New Zealand comedy-adventure-drama flick, written and directed by Taika Waititi (who also co-directed, co-wrote and costarred in last year's outstanding 'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS'). It's based on the 1986 book 'Wild Pork and Watercress' (by Barry Crump); and it stars Sam Neil and Julian Dennison. The film tells the story of a rebellious orphan boy, who runs away (into the woods) with his adoptive uncle. Child welfare services, and the law, hunt them down. The movie received rave reviews from critics (99% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), and it had the highest grossing opening weekend (at the Box Office) for any New Zealand film! I really enjoyed it.

Ricky (Dennison) is a rebellious young orphan, who's had trouble finding a home. Child welfare services places him with a couple in the country, named Hec (Neil) and Bella (Rima Te Wiata). Ricky has trouble, at first, adapting to life there; but he eventually learns to love his new home. When Bella suddenly passes away, child services decides that Hec is not a suitable guardian for the boy (on his own). Ricky then decides to run away, into the woods, out of fear he'll be stuck in a juvenile detention facility. Hec goes looking for him, and child services assumes the boy was abducted by the man. This results in a national manhunt, looking for the two.

The movie is sentimental at times, funny at other moments, and it's also even exciting (on a few occasions). One scene even made me cry (involving a dog). It's also a quirky, and very charming film. Neil and Dennison are both very likable in the leads, and the supporting roles are all fittingly cast. I think Waititi obviously has some talent, and I look forward to seeing what he does next. This film is definitely an enjoyable one.

New Wes Anderson?/ Live action Pixar's Up?/ Herzog road trip flick?/

All these things and more/ Hunt for the Wilderpeople/ Is one of a kind/

Taika Waititi/ Blends Conchords' quirky humour/ With blunt honesty/

It's an oft-told plot/ Here, stripped of (most) cliché, and/ Adorably sharp/

No adoption tale/ Treats its heartwarming heartbreak/ With such frank sweetness/

In Waititi's world/ Rude haikus voice real trauma/ Death is nonchalant/

He finds poignant joy/ In the saddest images/ Peace in a barn fire/

But lost in the woods/ With a brave dog named Tupac/ Old man and boy heal/

Learning life lessons/ In New Zealand's lush splendour/ As they hide their poop/

Good ol' grumps Sam Neill/ And Julian Dennison/ Are pricelessly cute/

Wry, no-nonsense laughs/ Battling boar and Rachel House/ Gleeful cartoon foe/

As the pace ramps up/ Tender character beats meet/ Thelma and Louise/

And a denouement/ So crisply wholesome there'll be/ Something in your eye/

A tiny triumph/ Mighty but unpretentious/ With humongous charm/

One of the year's best/ Don't miss these Wilderpeople/ The skux life chose you!
