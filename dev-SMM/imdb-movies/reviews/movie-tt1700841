### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.

Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first "adult" 3D animated film. The interpretation of "adult" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, "adult" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication.

I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?

Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet, sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about "getting baked." HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!

News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an audience member.

This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'

It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.

I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.

Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.

Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.

There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.

Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.

It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.

It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.

I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.

There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.

There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.

There was a graphic rape scene.

I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.

You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.

Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.

Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.

There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.

A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.

My fingers hurt from typing.

If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.

If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.

If could give it a 0/10 I would.

I'm not going to cry p.c. nonsense about the crude humour, I like crude humour, but in spades, this film was just a continuous attempt at badly executed shock value (food orgy) with absolutely no real story wrapped around it, they find out the world is "evil", kill the store staff, but never question the giant plot holes involved, such as:

If it is a film about talking food, how come a toilet roll and a douche can talk, but no other inanimate objects can't talk? Among other logic defying questions.

It reached a point where at the end they ran out of ideas and decided to build a StarGate to find the actors who voice them in real life for some reason or another, at that point I had checked out completely.

To conclude, it's too adult for kids, yet too stupid for adults.

Avoid.

I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie nearly as much as I actually do. I went in essentially expecting a typical Seth Rogan comedy, just random jokes and nothing else. But the rumors were true, it actually is more clever than it has any right to be.

I'll first say this, I don't think everyone will find it funny. If you aren't already a fan of Seth Rogan's movies, like I am, the humor probably won't do much for you. But I don't think anyone can deny that the movie's story is very smart, and I think might make up for some of the negatives you may have about the movie. The early reviews were right, it has a lot of clever things to say about religion, about taboos in society, about bigotry between cultures, and it's not lazy about any of these subjects.

Let me talk about the jokes for a second. Yes there are plenty of sexual jokes in it, a lot of which I found funny. But I think the majority of the laughs I had came from the different ethnic foods interacting with each other. I could watch the Bagel and Lavash argue with each other all day. If anything I think the majority of the sort of sexual jokes people expect from the movie happen at the very end, like the last 10 minutes of the movie.

The voice acting is also top notch. All the voices fit well with every character in the movie. I would love to see all of the actors in this in other animated roles. Some of the actors play there roles so well I had no idea which character they were. I had no idea that Edward Norton was the Bagel, or that Paul Rudd was the main Grocery Store employee. They all give great performances.

But don't get me wrong, there are problems. Probably the major one being that the villain really doesn't need to be there. He just kind of serves to be a slightly disturbing character, who sucks out other products' juice to become stronger. If they cut him out of the movie we wouldn't have missed anything, apart from a few jokes from him. Also the ending is very, well, an ending, in that it ends the movie. It's one of those endings I wouldn't really describe as "bad" or "good" it's just sort of "I don't really know how else they could have ended it, so yeah I guess that works."

The animation isn't all that great either, I mean it's not awful, but it really shows that this is this particular company's first animated film. One thing in particular that put me off was the designs on the human characters, they're so hideous to look at. I have a feeling that's part of the joke, but they really do look gross, and off-putting.

There is one more thing I have to say though. In the long run I'm a little worried about the impact this might have on other R rated animated movies. I'm a little worried that this might affect other movies in a similar fashion as how Shrek affected kids movies. Like how Shrek was funny and made a lot of money, so other studios, and Dreamworks themselves, tried to replicate the success, and we ended up getting really bad "Self-Aware Parody" movies like Chicken Little. I just don't want the same thing to happen with this movie.

I wouldn't call this movie "typical Adult Swim fodder" like I thought I'd be calling it. It's too clever to deserve that label. It's a movie that actually understands what "Satire" is, and in a day and age where we have people just posting racial obscenities and calling it "satire" when called out on it, I think it's great to see an R rated animated movie actually understand how to do satire.

I would recommend giving this movie a chance. I really respect that it doesn't just throw crap at the wall and expects you to laugh. I wouldn't go as far as to call this one of my favorite animated movies of all time, but I will say I'm glad I saw it, and I had a lot of fun watching it. I would give this movie an 8/10. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I do respect it, and I want to see more good R rated animated movies come out of it.

So this is the animated movie that came out of nowhere and got a bunch of people of talking all because of it's trailer. Let me tell you right now, the red-band trailer for this movie is funnier than the movie itself. And the whole reason the trailer made me laugh was because at first it looks like a regular animated movie, then the swearing and sex jokes happen. Speaking of which, this movie is nothing but swearing and sex jokes, oh and stereotypes. Because writing personalities for animated characters is so difficult, almost every character is just a walking stereotype. The bagel's Jewish, the lavash is Muslim, the sauerkraut is a Nazi, are you laughing yet?!? That is the extent of this movies "humor", it is literally just that. So if you think swearing and sex jokes is the pinnacle of comedy, then this'll be the funniest movie you've ever seen. However, if you're above the age of 14, then this movie will just exist, exist and not be funny in the slightest. This movie only made me chuckle twice, I laughed more during "The Theory of Everything", and I'm pretty sure that movie wasn't a freakin' comedy!!! This is without a doubt the worst animated movie I've seen, and it's a shame that actors like Edward Norton had to be in it. I can't wait for the eventual sequel where all the food comes to the real world and interacts with their voice actors, won't that be hilarious?! Does anybody else think that the makers of this movie paid off top critics to give this positive reviews? Because I honestly can't understand why anyone who's old enough to see an R-rated movie would find this funny at all.

When I first saw this film advertised I really looked forward to it. Within minutes of it starting I thought, "Yeah, oh well... let's give it a chance". Pretty much everything from that moment is lost time I will never re-coup.

Maybe if the plot was good I could give it more stars, maybe if the jokes were funny I could give it more stars, maybe if the scenes were engaging, maybe, maybe maybe. But none of that was to be. The only reason I gave it 2 was that the animation was pretty good, but that's hardly a redeeming quality to overcome the the vacuous and childish premise of the whole film.

I like swearing just as much as the next red blooded Australian. But only 10 year old's would find the way it was used in this film more than slightly amusing. Along with that and the infantile sex jokes, the whole thing took me right back to primary school... except we weren't subject to such crass stupidity from adults then. We were kids and made it up for ourselves. It was a very short lived phase of childhood. I find it hard to believe there's people out there that didn't mature past that point.

Gladly I can say that I didn't watch the whole thing, neither will I waste my time writing much more about it. You can save yourself further disappointment now, too. It's not too late.

When I saw the trailer, I thought it would be fun. But when I watched the full movie, I was totally embarrassed. Its not a matter of religion, nor a matter of anything - but this animation started with a great starting but it failed miserably at the end. Characters were funny, story was great at the beginning, But food sex ? Seriously ? You could Mark the Film as a 18+ Animation. Sorry, but watching this animation was a great waste of my time . I couldn't even watch it with the kids.Boring story line made it even worse. Try to make a better film next time. I can't say more. I wish, I could give it a Zero. But, sorry, I can't.

Interesting concept - the entirety of the interesting part can be seen in the trailers. Save yourself both the money and an hour and a half of your life.

Once you get past the shock novelty of food talking and being ridiculously raunchy the movie becomes pathetic, repetitive and dull.

Bottom line- Should have been a 5 minute cartoon. Beyond that it is really just a raunchy, garbage philosophy, amorality play - A vehicle for the usual nihilistic liberal memes involving sexuality, romanticism of hard drugs and atheism. I could forgive the vacuous leftist part if the movie were genuinely creative and funny. It isn't. It is an Utterly stupid, vacuous waste of time.

Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.

In a supermarket named Shopwell's, the various tasty treats that line the shelves spend their days praying they will be picked and taken to the great unknown by shoppers, who they view as gods. Each morning starts with a sing-a-long, and they try to live their life by a set of rules they believe will led to them being chosen, including no sex until they're out of their packet. Hot dog Frank (Rogen) only allows himself to touch tips with the bun he's in love with, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), saving themselves for the inevitable day when they get carried off into paradise. But with the return of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who claims that he witnessed torture and horror at the hands of the 'gods' who devoured some of his friends, Frank sets off on a journey of discovery and awakening.

Similar in many ways to Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Sausage Party imagines what it would be like if the food we consume to eagerly could talk to each other and wonders what they would make of us. But while Woody and co. would flop to the ground whenever a human walked in the room, the characters here exist in the 'fourth dimension', unseen by humans. This allows more freedom for directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon to deliver as many outlandish set pieces as they would like, and two scenes in particular - one inspired by Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the other featuring an Irish potato being skinned alive while his friends watch - are actually quite terrifying. The film is certainly at its best during these moments, and there are scenes of real ingenuity amongst the carnage.

The first half whizzes by and is a blast, but then the film seems to lose direction and wander aimlessly from one scene to another. It also struggles to tickle the funny bone, and relies too heavily on tired food puns, familiar shtick from the likes of James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader, and outright vulgarity. Someone should point out to the writers - which include Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg - that using "f**k" every other word doesn't automatically make a film 'adult', but quickly becomes unpleasant and completely unnecessary, especially when the characters are otherwise perfectly likable. Also, the inclusion of Douche (Nick Kroll), the cavity-cleaner who holds a grudge against Frank, serves only a distraction from the more interesting central plot.

Still, despite its many flaws and irritating tics, I very much enjoyed Sausage Party for what it is, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you haven't enjoyed much of Rogen's previous output, chances are you won't love Sausage Party, although there's plenty of visual splendour to savour in between the d**k jokes. At its best, it offers interesting parallels to real-world issues, such as the relationship between a lavash named Kareem (David Krumholtz) and a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton doing a pitch-perfect Woody Allen impression), and their bickering over shelf space. Of course, this is the edible version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and while it may embrace comedic stereotyping throughout, Sausage Party never intends to offend, and instead offers a surprisingly sympathetic message about the necessity of religion. Whatever your view, the fact that a film like this can be greenlit and unleashed on a mainstream audience is cause for celebration.

Here's the entire script

Food 1: F**k Food 2: F**k S**t innuendo Food 1: Motherf**k S**t C**t (Repeat for all scenes)

A great story idea which could've got people thinking completely ruined by a script with no real jokes. Being British, it's in my nature to swear unnecessarily every other word, but when will Seth Rogan and his mates realise that swearing constantly is no longer funny and people are just bored of it. This film could've been something so special that would sit forever in that group of amazing did-it-firsts that everyone tries to copy but fails at. But someone will do it better. This was just F**king S**t

i went into this movie expecting to at least enjoy something? i wanted to like it. but more than anything it was just underwhelming and mediocre. it was extremely boring, i laughed at maybe 5 jokes (none of which were memorable). wouldn't recommend personally but if you like movies with a script that was obviously written by 4 high rich dudes completely out of touch with society, forced unfunny jokes reminiscent of a 12 year old lets player on youtube, and uninspired visuals that look like they went with the first draft, then this might be a good movie for you.

wouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys good movies, would recommend to anyone who is easily amused n thinks its funny when dudes are high and kids cartoons say f)ck a lot

Before I start this review I'm telling you that I generally love Seth Rogan's sense of humour and all of the actors that were voicing the characters I love as well, but this movie made me cringe. The entire plot of the movie sounded great and watching the trailers definitely caught everyone's attention, and it's not that often that an adult animation comes out and gets that much hype. It had a really good unique idea. The voice acting and animations were done really well. That's about where the positivity ends.

The first time I tried to watch it with my boyfriend, and we shut it off after the "rape scene" with the douche and the juice box about 15 minutes or so into the movie. I mean, I can get how it can kind of be comical because I mean, it's a douche and a juice box, but just the fact that they were trying to compare it to rape was a bit screwed up and made me uncomfortable.

The second time I tried to watch it was with one of my friends who swore it was hilarious and we just had to watch it so I was forced to watch it and finish it. The entire time she was laughing at every stupid and lazy attempt they made at humour and I was sitting there straight-faced wishing it was over.

I have a pretty good sense of humour but the constant sexual jokes in this movie weren't even clever at all and they were pretty pathetic.. the kind of twelve year old boys make when they try to make everything sound sexual. I was happy when I thought movie had finally come to an end when suddenly all the food randomly started having this massive orgy which was another 5 minutes of pointless ridiculousness.

Honestly, this had a good idea but just turned out to be complete trash, and not the funny kind. It was just pathetic and sad that people wasted so much time and money to create it. If you have this certain sense of humour that finds absolutely everything funny, you'd probably laugh a few times. If you're like me where it takes more than some weak sexual innuendos and over-the-top deaths to make you laugh then please do yourself a favour and skip this one. Everyone I know that has seen this (except that one friend) hated it.

Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas) they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it actually is.

It's sad too because the cast is super talented too. (Kroll, Whig, Cera, Rogan, Hayak) which means that the fault lies solely on the writing which comes off more as a summer camp sketch than a movie. It relies way too heavily on recycled racist tropes that were done better in a 50s Looney Tunes cartoon. That mixed with just yawn worthy sexual innuendo makes the film unbearable and leaves you praying that the film ends soon. Which is ironic because that's the opposite of what the film wants you to do.

I spend more time plotting how to gracefully exit the theater than about the actual movie (yes I did make it to the end. This profanity ridden movie will make anyone with a slight moral conscience cringe within the first 5 minutes, and it doesn't get any better. Don't get me wrong, there are many extremely offensive movies that I have enjoyed, but Sausage Party has little humor despite how much I really wanted to find it funny. It's like watching a middle school nerdy kid trying to lewdly entertain the cool seniors in a high school; yes it's that uncomfortable.

I saw the trailer and thought it would be another hilarious Seth movie, but I was painfully wrong. I highly discourage; you don't know this but you're life will be better not knowing what lies in this failed attempt to entertain.

Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.

Before the events of Sausage Party, Brenda and Frank live inside their separate packages; Frank being partnered with friends Carl (Hill) and the diminutive Barry (Cera) among others. Every morning, the denizens of Shopwell sing a song of joy while they lay in waiting for a benevolent god (human) to choose them and take them to the "great beyond". Failure to be chosen, or worse dropped on the floor, means produce is to be thrown away in a seemingly bottomless abyss of a grocery store garbage bin. Frank and Brenda however like their chances. It's a few days till red, white and blue day; what could go wrong? One returned container of Honey Mustard (McBride) who forecasts doom is what can go wrong. That and a particularly testy Douche (Kroll) angered by a grocery cart accident that sullies his chances to be useful.

As an animation, Sausage Party is artfully, colorfully and simplistically rendered. Each section of the grocery store lights up with a look and feel that compliments the local produce. After the doors close the Mexican food area resembles a rustic western cantina, the cookware section beams with the silvery glow of shimmering straight edges and the alcohol aisle is just one big rave. Environments outside the store are limited yet realistically depict the kitchen of a prim housewife and the dingy living room of a bugged out druggie. The less I tell you about the brief street scene, the better. Overall, it's obvious there were limitations in the budget yet if compared to the similarly themed Foodfight! (2012), this film's animation is an artistic triumph.

The embedded oddness of the story lends itself to some pretty unique and funny jokes. Ones that hit the funny-bones of all not easily offended or grossed out. Such highlights include a bagel (Norton) and a lavash (Krumholtz) arguing about having to share an aisle, a Grits (Robinson) package being misplaced by "dirty good-for-nothing' crackers," and legions of sourkraut looking to exterminate the juice. Needless to say there are times when the film get's lost in the tall grass with over-broad ethnic stereotypes (A Native American liquor bottle named Firewater certainly ranks among the most egregious). But let's face it, if you're sold on the premise of a R- Rated animated comedy about food-stuffs you probably won't be too concerned.

Sausage Party is a funny, funny, funny movie that doesn't just hand in shock value laughs for the sake of shock value laughs. It's also a well-created hero's journey with something to say and avoids all the pratfalls of modern comedy by A: not relying on broad improvisational humor and B: lands that third act like it's its b***h! Speaking of which: don't take your kids to go see Sausage Party. This is not the film you can harangue "cool mom" points with, seriously. Keep those little tykes at bay at least until their old enough to purchase their own heroin syringes.

Let me start off this review by saying I like Seth Rogen. I like low-brow, shock humor. I love biting satire. By all metrics, I should've been the target audience for this film. But I couldn't remember the last time a movie actually made me as angry as I felt watching Sausage Party.

Look, I *get* what this movie was trying to do. Really, I do. Its admirable ambition is the ONLY reason I give it a 3/10 and not a 1. But it fails in every place it was trying to succeed. Let me explain.

1. It fails as a send-up of saccharine Pixar animated films. Parody really is an art form of its own. To do it well, the medium needs to look and feel - at first blush - like something sincere, which allows the artist to invert expectations of the audience (thus, humor). Just look at the best satire: The Onion takes on the tone of a daily newspaper; Young Frankenstein feels like a classic horror film; Weird Al Yankovic sounds like the musicians he parodies. Parody requires a nuanced and keen understanding of whatever source material it's sending-up.

Sausage Party seems to think it's a Pixar parody because it a) uses inanimate objects as characters, and b) is animated. But that's not what makes Pixar movies Pixar movies. They have emotion, they have clever characters, and they make unexpected and subtle observations on humanity.

The closest Sausage Party came to giving us Pixar-inspired characters were the queer taco and the Stephen Hawking-esque piece of chewed up gum, and neither is on screen long enough to carry the film. The rest of the "parody" is dependent on the fact that animation as a medium is most commonly used for children's entertainment, and Sausage Party clearly isn't for children. If that's parody, then it's parody in its laziest, most artificial form.

2. It fails as shock humor. I get that this is subjective and everyone has their own meter for "what is shocking," but I'm going to go out on a limb and say no one over the age of 11 thinks cartoon characters being vulgar is shocking. South Park busted down that barrier two decades ago. Adult Swim has been around for almost as long. In a world of Borat, 4chan, and There's Something About Mary, if you want to go for pure shock laughs, you need a lot more than f-bombs and sex puns.

That being said, for shock humor to actually be, well, shocking, it needs to come as a surprise. If the entire film beats you over the head with profanity, drug references, and wiener jokes, then it by definition can't be shocking. It simply becomes tedium.

3. It fails as commentary on organized religion. This was probably the most disappointing failure because the idea that humans are gods over food and food has to tell themselves the gods are bringing them to a "great beyond" to give their lives meaning is indeed a clever concept. There was an opportunity for Rogen n Co to make an anti- Veggie Tales that could've been something sharp and brilliant. But it just so poorly done.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker did the anti-belief message beautifully in The Book of Mormon. In it, the characters grow to question their faith, and their new-found skepticism pays off with a unique and clever spin at the end (with lots of smart laughs along the way).

In Sausage Party, on the other hand, instead of using religious skepticism as a vehicle for character development, it was more the bow that tied a bunch of juvenile jokes to some pseudo-intelligent theme. There was no organic transformation. It was a forced conclusion to justify ending on an orgy (because ultimately nothing really matters and all we have is joy and pleasure in this life yadda yadda ya get it?! GET IT?!?)

The fact Sausage Party had such potential makes the results all the more annoying. In more skilled hands it really could've been a fun, acerbic send-up of Pixar AND religion. Instead, what we have is an over-long, single-joke animated SNL skit with all the charm and brilliance of a jackhammer. Painful.

Okay, to start this off: this movie is definitely NOT for kids. It definitely deserves its R-rating. Sausage Party is one of those movies that will make you say: what the hell am I watching?

To be frank(see what I did there?), this movie fulfilled every bit of expectation I had, no more and no less in its "well, I think I've seen enough" factor. What I mean by that, is that this is the most vulgar and xenophobic animated movie I've ever seen but in a good way. As obnoxious as this movie is, I can't help but giggle half the time when I'm watching it, even though how disgusting and indecent some of the scenes are, especially at the end. And mostly because of that, I will never see food the same way ever again(the animation is pretty good though).

Maybe my only true complaint about this movie was the ending, since it seems it was just tacked in there "just because" but to be fair, the movie was already weird as it is. So yeah, the ending for me felt kinda random and I feel that it should've ended in that particular scene before it but overall, I don't think it won't affect what most people thought about this film. Though I expect that this movie will offend a lot of people but to hell with that! let your immature side take over for a while and enjoy this film about food getting it on and on and on..... and on.

If you like humor that is both weird and outrageously crass but still remotely funny, then look no further since Sausage Party is the movie for you.

Firstly, BIG fan of the Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill collective, especially since the first time I lost my **** at Superbad back in day. However, this is, in my opinion, one of the poorest films I have ever seen. The humour wasn't funny or original, and I usually root for the over-the-line, Family-Guy- esque jokes, believe me, but this was beyond off-colour - even with insinuations towards rape being presented as simple gross-out humour scenes. The characters were ridiculous and/or based on racist stereotypes that just aren't funny. I dunno...perhaps it's just that it's incredibly dated or that it's a film for American teens. I just found it awful. Everything about it was weak. I could go on, but maybe check out the mere first 5 mins and you'll see what I mean.

So I have nothing against Seth Rogen and I quite liked some of his other R rated movies like This is the End and Interview. This one though, gets no where near to being remotely entertaining and the lack of effort in making this movie is plainly visible. I imagine Seth got the idea for anthropomorphic grocery during one of their weed sessions and then decided to make a film about it. The producers at Sony probably hurried them into making this so they could follow in the footsteps of Deadpool and profit. You can't just throw crass humour and expect it to come good always. You need to write a ton of jokes, pick the better ones and then improve on them. The only way you can entertain people with the first thing that comes into your mind is if you are a comedic genius; unfortunately there aren't any in the Jew gang.

This movie truly lacks substance and humor, it downplays rape and targets minorities for insensitive stereotypical jokes. The writers must all be white. The SOLE pleasure that came to me when watching this is the fact that they introduced 2 gay characters, a bisexual bun, and a lesbian taco. OK that's all this movie sucked

I'm not going to write a review. i'll just write my opinion. Awful, disgusting, worst, the most stupid and meaningless movie

EVER. I can't understand how has it even played on cinema. If someone is reading this and wondering if to watch this

movie believe me the right decision is NO. I also can't understand which one self respecting actor will voice any of the

characters and how there is a such brainless human who wrote this scenario living on this planet. I really hope my little

brother or my children one day will never accidentally fall on this movie and watch it.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I usually watch any movie before I let my little cousins watch it , but If I don't have time I just check the movie here ...However , I don't do this for animation movies because for me it's a kids movie a family movie , In this case, I liked the Trailer (unfortunately I discovered later that the channel that I saw it on they hide all pornography from the trailer) I saw the movie alone after the first 10 minutes I spit my drinks from the shock , the "F" word is said out loud with no noise around it cover it and many more sexual words.

What would've happened if I let my 6 years old cousin watch a "cartoon" and then came to ask me "What does Cu** means?!" 

Never In my life, I thought I would see an animation movie as a porn movie.

something else,one of the character is a Muslim man , who can't wait to go to the greater beyond to enjoy the "77 virgins" & when he found out the ain't going he became GAY.

I'm Muslim , other people religions & sexuality DOESN'T concern me at all , as long as they are good people .

So, why would the movie include anything about religion ??!!! & as I understand being Gay is something you are not something you become when there is no other choice.

for me it a pile of BS & SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY CHILDREN AT ALL

First, i respect others way of thinking but the movie deals with some sort of a vague analogy from the social interaction of the many cultures that make our world, regarding the main issue i for one have read this on books but don't have the reference at this moment, but some how the center idea goes out something like in reality we do not perceive beings that are in higher or lower levels of existence, therefore we are oblivious that the higher beings form a chain of predator nature, feeding on the weaker more simpler beings, this has a strong relation to the esoteric philosophy of the early postmodernism of the 70's, that there are cosmic gators, or lions or other animals depicted by ancient cultures that some way are blah blah blah gods... this is just as a watermelon milkshake, but it speaks of the collective interest of that peculiar group of artist that make movies, and get hooked by them and sough out to express their thoughts, the way they do it is most representative of them self's, by taking that crap in to the movie theater... but to me, i have to say that they need to smoke less herbs, read more, and grow an opinion of their own, and by that you have to consume your life to endless lectures about the development of philosophy and logic, what can i share in simple words is that in some point it begins to add up, and only then you star to realize where is God, and Who he is, unfortunately the are too busy having amazing prosperous lives to care about reading Imanuel Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Levinas, Habermass, and many many more, that add bits and pieces to a far far greater than life story, that corresponds to math and physics and all that, but the main point is that the don't read as much as the should, otherwise the movie here should be less stupid, and the resources taken by this production better spent.

I was actually thinking this might be a good cartoon. I enjoy a good cartoon like like all 3 of the kung fu panda movies, the Ice Age movies, Toy Story, etc etc. I found I could be entertained by them. They had a good story, whit, comedy and great animation. This one had none of those. What it did have in it was F bombs and expletives in just about every sentence. And it was clear that was the main focus of this movie to keep that pace all the way through. It got really old after about 5 minutes. I guess they all thought that was going to be the comedy by just using those words over and over and over again throughout the entire movie. I can imagine them sitting down over a script to see how of them they put in the shortest space possible. In high school I could cuss with the best of them but even then there a lot of people who took it to the extreme where they could not talk without cussing. Always irritated me a bit to talk to people who were like that. Many of them had almost no vocabulary at all without the cuss words. I downloaded the movie to watch and couldn't bring myself to finish it. I lasted probably 20 minutes hoping it would tone down a bit but it never did. I guess everyone involved in making this junk movie just thought it was going to look cool to be able to cuss all the way through the movie with no restriction and thought that would be enough to carry the film. This movie was not a bit funny to me despite the over used f bombs. Then they got all these actors to fall in this nonsense. I guess a bucks a bucks cause I sure can't see a higher calling than that. This movie was just bad, and they actually tried pretty hard to make it bad.
