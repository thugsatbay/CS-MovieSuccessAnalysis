"Doubt can be a bond as strong as fear." If ever there was a time in our country's recent history where that line carried the force of relevance, it's now.

And though it's set in the early 1960s (roughly a year after the Kennedy assassination), there's no doubt that John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own Pulitzer-Prize winning stage play is a response to these dark times, when the only thing that seems to be uniting Americans is their collective insecurity and ever-weakening belief that things are going to get better.

At the center of "Doubt" is the mystery of whether or not a priest (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is guilty of taking advantage of an altar boy. The priest's primary (and really sole) prosecutor is Sister Aloysius, the uber-stern and terrifying principal of the Catholic school that provides "Doubt" its setting. Watching Hoffman and Streep spar is like watching two professional tennis players at their best, and fans of expert movie acting should waste no time in seeing the sparks fly between these two. The movie purposely never clarifies the ambiguity of the charges -- is Hoffman's priest truly guilty of something, or is Sister Aloysius simply on a mad witch hunt? Streep's character is the most fascinating. From one perspective, she's a nearly maniacal harpie, intent on ruining a man's life and career for no clear reason. However, if her accusations are legitimate, she's a sort of hero, demanding justice from a male-dominated world that's willing to look the other way. Streep's performance is something fascinating to behold -- she can convey more with an arched eyebrow than another actor can with his entire face.

Amy Adams gets the pivotal role of a young, innocent nun who first brings her suspicions about the priest to her superior, and then sees them become Frankenstein's monster. In many ways, Adams' character is us, the audience, placed in the position of having to come to a conclusion on our own when empirical evidence is lacking. Adams' role is the least showy, but she does much with it.

And then there's Viola Davis, who, in five minutes of screen time, decimates the audience with some shocking conclusions of her own as the altar boy's mother. The insulated, hushed world of the Catholic Church is blown wide open by this struggling mother, who's seen more of the world than any of the priests and nuns sheltered behind the church's walls, and who puts the film's running themes of racial and gender inequality into harsh perspective.

The central conflict in "Doubt" in many ways comes down to each individual's view of the world and his or her ability to accept the ambiguity of day to day living. There's a lot about the world we will never know and much about our futures we'll never be able to control. So what's better -- anticipating the worst and therefore being prepared when it comes; or believing in the best and running the risk of being disappointed when it fails to arise? The movie just poses this question -- it doesn't try to answer it. 

"Doubt" is not a fancy movie and will win no awards for its cinematic audacity. But in looking back at the movies of 2008, I imagine it will stand as one of the best-acted films of the year.

There are no better actors working in American film today than Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. Pairing off as adversaries in John Patrick Shanley's stage play brought to screen they parry and prod throughout with each landing hay makers along the way.

Change is in the wind in 1964 for both the world and the Catholic Church (Second Vatican Council) as the country moves from conservatism to liberal thought. Sister Aloysius (Streep)is the principal of an inner city Catholic school who rules with an iron fist. Lamenting the loss of tradition (she thinks Frosty the Snowman is a song about worshiping false idols) she crosses swords with the popular and laid back Father Flynn who takes a more liberal view seeing the need to keep up with the times. His progressive ways gnaw at Sister Aloysius and she is soon suspecting Father Flynn of inappropriate relationship with altar boys even though she is without concrete proof.

The scenes between Streep and Hoffman are riveting from start to finish. Both attempt at first to be civil with each other but eventually they end up at each others throat bullying and threatening. It is a titanic emotional struggle that makes for a gripping drama flawlessly acted. I'm no big fan of Streep, finding the adopted accents she employs in some of her films false and hollow, but as the self righteous Nunzilla her pugnacious style and inflection rates with her Sophie's Choice performance. Hoffman has his work cut out for him to keep up with the formidable legend but he holds his own with equal footing.

In supporting roles Amy Adams is very effective as the unintended go between Sister James. Seized with doubt she like the audience mirrors our own misgivings as conflicted objective observers. Viola Davis as a troubled boy's mother has one lengthy powerful and painful scene that begins to tie loose ends together but offers no easy solution.

Writer director John Patrick Shanley does an admirable job in keeping the plot nebulous with ambivalent scenes and peripheral characters that purposefully enhance the suspense. Scenes are tightly edited with sparse but effective dialog giving the film its steady pace. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end.

Normally we give too much credit to actors. They often work for short periods and force myriad takes. Directors manipulate and cajole them. Then the filmmakers spend months choosing the best shots, carving them and stringing them together to make the story (and the long-gone actors) look good.

"Doubt" is an exception, only in that the actors are especially marvelous. The many close-ups and the length of the shots attest to the trust John Patrick Shanley puts in them. Streep and Hoffman are superb. Adams and Davis are remarkable as well.

Still the most credit for this phenomenal effort must go to Shanley.

What a fascinating story, with layers and springbacks that will leave you thinking and rethinking.

Thank you very much to all involved with this fine film.

According to a report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, over four thousand clerics were accused of sexual abuse during the past fifty years. Although approximately thirty percent of these accusations were not investigated because they were unsubstantiated, given the proclivity of the bishops to cover up these incidents, the figures are widely suspected to be underestimated. What may be lost in the discussion of statistics about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, however, is an understanding of the humanity of the people involved or the complexities of the circumstances.

This factor is brought to light in Doubt, John Patrick Shanley's filmed version of his Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning stage play. Based on Shanley's personal experiences at Catholic School, the film explores not only the issue of possible sexual abuse but conservative versus progressive religious values and how far one can rely on suspicion in the absence of proof. Set in 1964, one year after the Kennedy assassination, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) is the dragon lady of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx. A strict taskmaster, she relishes her role as the upholder of tradition, rejecting such modern devices as ballpoint pens and the singing of secular songs at Christmas like Frosty the Snowman which she equates with pagan magic.

Under Aloysius is the sweet and innocent Sister James (Amy Adams) whose easy going manner and charming personality is a welcome antidote to her authoritarian superior. The priest at St. Nicholas is Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is the closest thing to a progressive at the school. He is open to new ideas and the changes initiated by Pope John XXIII, being much more open and relaxed with the children and engaging them in sports and conversation. In his sermons he brings the language of religion into the twentieth century, talking about the positive aspects of doubt and the injurious effects of gossip. "Doubt", he says, "can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty. When you are lost, you are not alone." Resentful of the role of women in the Catholic Church and suspicious of Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius assigns Sister James to keep an eye peeled for anything unusual in his conduct. Her fears appear justified when Sister James reports that Father Flynn asked Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the school's only African-American student, to a private conference in the rectory and was seen hanging up the boys undershirt in his locker. Sister James also informs her that there was alcohol on the boy's breath and that the boy seemed upset when returning to his desk.

Although no inappropriate behavior was witnessed, Sister Aloysius suspects wrongdoing and summons the priest to her office on the pretext of discussing the Christmas pageant. She accuses the priest of misconduct with the altar boy who denies that he gave altar wine to the boy or that anything unusual happened. The drama takes more twists and turns, especially when Donald's mother (Viola Davis) raises Aloysius' eyebrows by suggesting that, in spite of the allegations, the boy, who is due to enter high school in a few months, may be better off in the hands of the priest than having to face his intolerant and abusive father.

Doubt avoids easy answers and challenges us to view inflammatory issues from a broader perspective, embracing the essential mystery of human behavior. The acting in the film is uniformly brilliant. Streep is mesmerizing, even if at times more theatrical than may be necessary for the character. Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is more restrained and draws our sympathy with his broader view of church doctrine and display of love and compassion, although his demeanor at the end tantalizingly suggests remorse.

What may be the most noteworthy performance, however, is that of Viola Davis whose dialogue with Aloysius is one of the dramatic high points of the film. The issue of whether Father Flynn acted as a friend and mentor to the boy or a sexual partner is ultimately left to the viewer to resolve, though what is beyond doubt is that absolute certainty without considering other points of view is a dead end for all involved.

Strong performances are the saving grace of "Doubt," an otherwise uneven, overly glib tale of possible sexual abuse in one New York City parish circa 1964.

Sister Aloysius is a tradition-bound nun who goes through life utterly untroubled by uncertainty or doubt, running her convent and grade school with unyielding self-righteousness and the iron fist of unchallenged authority. Sister Aloysius doesn't take any more kindly to the accoutrements of the modern world - she has banned all ballpoint pens from the premises and decries "Frosty the Snowman" as a celebration of pagan magic - than she does to the "liberalizing" effect Vatican II has had on the Church she views as the last bastion of morality in an increasingly permissive and immoral world. This puts her in direct conflict with Father Flynn, a reform-minded, man-of-the-people priest who is more concerned with his parishioners' needs than with church ritual per se - yet whom Sister Aloysius has reason to suspect might be a pedophile. Or is she simply targeting the man and seeing what she wants to see because his view of the Church is so at odds with her own? The third main character, Sister James, is a perpetually upbeat but generally naïve novice who becomes more than a disinterested bystander in the war-of-wills that erupts between her two equally hardnosed superiors.

In adapting his play to the screen, writer/director John Patrick Shanley hits on some intriguing themes revolving around certainty vs. doubt and traditionalism vs. progressivism, but the movie isn't always as intellectually honest and convincing as one might wish it to be, especially when Shanley indulges in such hokey effects as the winter wind batting against the windows or well-orchestrated thunder bolts crashing overhead at "meaningful" moments in the picture. Similarly, the reactions the characters have to one another and the situation they're involved in don't always ring true given the less enlightened time period in which the story takes place. And the final "transformative" moment comes upon us with such abruptness and with so little preparation that it quite literally rings down the curtain on the entire enterprise.

Yet, despite all these flaws, "Doubt" periodically rises to the occasion and does justice to the complexity of its subject matter. This is particularly the case in a searing scene between Sister Aloysius and the mother of one of the boys who may have fallen victim to Father Flynn's inappropriate conduct, a scene that catches us completely off-guard with its sheer unexpectedness and its paradigm-shifting effect on the story.

Moreover, the performances are uniformly excellent, starting with Meryl Streep who brings a surprising amount of humor and even warmth to a character who is, for all intents and purposes, cut off from her emotions by her dogmatically rigid nature. Phillip Seymour Hoffman effectively keeps us guessing as to the truth about his character, never tipping his hand one way or the other as to what is taking place in the depths of his soul. Amy Adams makes a compelling stand-in for those of us in the audience who are trying to reserve judgment on these two characters before all the facts are revealed. Special note must also be taken of Viola Davis, superb in her brief but unforgettable appearance as the mother who delivers an unsettling response to news that her son may have been the victim of a sexual predator.

The movie seems to suggest that one can never have one hundred percent certitude about anything in this life and that actions must often be taken even when all the "facts" in a particular case can never be fully known. Yet, what happens when such an action could result in the destruction of another person's livelihood and reputation? It's an interesting theme that is only sporadically well addressed by "Doubt," but the food-for-thought that the movie provides makes it worth checking out anyway.

Wow! Incredible performances from Meryl Streep and Philip Seymore Hoffman. Mesmerizing intensity from Streep as the nun seeking to find Hoffman guilty of a sin he may or may not have committed. Amy Adams gives a sincere performance as the nun who sets the ball rolling with her suspicions that Hoffman may have molested a black student. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman crackle with intelligence and frightening intensity. Streep, as the unrelenting figure of justice, determined at any cost to destroy Hoffman, is terrifying and unrelenting. Hoffman gives a performance less restrained and mannered than the one he gave in Capote (and won the Oscar for) and boy, does he ever deserve to have won a second one for this outing. An absolute knockout, nuanced and convincing in every way. What a masterful performance! John Patrick Shanley's script is riveting from start to finish. If anyone has any doubts about watching this movie due to the theme then put those doubts aside as the writing and acting are without doubt amongst the finest ever committed to film. A superb piece of work.

'Doubt' has turned out to be quite a fascinating puzzle. The story is pretty much told through dialogue rather than portrayal of events. Shanley's overwhelming screenplay is so effective and the element of mystery is carried out so strongly that even the viewer is left doubting the actions of the priest and the motives of the head nun (were her accusations legitimate or was it all an intent to ruin the priest). His incredible direction takes us through the psyche of the four principle characters.

Needless to say, the outstanding performances are just the necessary requirements that Shanley has successfully met. After all, who could ask for a better cast than Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis? All these actors display some of the best acting of their career. It is both the dialogue delivery and the non-verbal gestures that strengthens the doubts in the viewers mind and makes the characters nonetheless more convincing.

The slightly washed-out colours give the look of the 60s but also adds to the mysterious atmosphere. 'Doubt' is a very thought-provoking film. It has one questioning. Should the nun have reacted or should she have waited for evidence? But what if it was already too late for evidence? What has doubt done to them? It has them questioning themselves constantly. It has stolen their sleep. We accept that it is human to doubt but what does doubt do to us? What kind of power does it hold above us? How do we react on it? When should we react on it? The director beautifully manages to convey and provoke this without appearing pretentious or preachy.

Doubt {dir. John Patrick Shanley} (****/****)

Although it includes some heavy themes, Doubt, is one of the most entertaining and involving films to come along in quite sometime. Rarely have my heart and mind been so engaged in a film simultaneously. At its heart, Doubt remains the stage play upon which it is based, about a priest who is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a young boy. The priest is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the nun investigating (Sister Aloysius, great name) the situation is played by Meryl Streep, the best living actress and the best actress of the year. The language used in the film treats the situation very carefully and the confrontations between the characters crackle with well- written intensity. The film's central theme is indeed the title: Doubt. As an audience, we are left to our own devices in judging Father Flynn's relationship to the young boy. This uncertainty is a rare and valuable thing in film today. Great performances, wonderful writing and tough themes.

I think there are two distinct cases to discuss: the case in the movie; the case about the movie.

The case in the movie: it is 1964 and in a Catholic school in Bronx a conflict erupts between the principal (Meryl Streep) and the priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The principal is Sister Aloysius, a nun very strict about the discipline. The priest, Father Flynn, is just the opposite, a very natural guy, open to people and to the world. The nun suspects him of pedophilia. The suspicion will never be confirmed, never thrown away. Eventually it's up to us to decide, and our role of spectators is played in the movie by Sister James (Amy Adams), a younger nun who is trying to understand what really is, oscillating between the two. By the way, genial idea of using male names for the Catholic nuns, to stress out the strictness of their rules.

The case about the movie: the epoch Doubt was made and the epoch the picture takes place are very different. The sixties were the years of Vatican II; the Catholic Church was opening largely its windows. It was the conflict (often brutal) between new and tradition, between progressives and conservatives. This was then. Today the Church is facing the scandals of pedophilia (and the way they are handled by the Catholic hierarchy).

So, if we take the epoch of the sixties, we take the side of Father Flynn, a man open to modernity, empathizing with the youth, with their questions and their way of seeing the world, speaking the language of his epoch, a wonderful man suspected by a retrograde nun.

Only the movie is made today, for today's viewers, and we are focused on today's issues. So here is the question: once the nun had suspicions that the priest was a pedophile, what was the right way to take? To not follow a case without positive evidence? Or, by the contrary, to follow the case, to force him to come with proofs of his innocence? What was more important: his right to privacy or the safety of the boys? We can say that the movie leaves the case open. Nothing demonstrates positively that the priest is a pedophile; nothing demonstrates that he isn't.

Well, the movie brings something more: what if? What if the boy is born with another orientation and the priest is just understanding and protecting him? Maybe just because the priest has the same orientation? There is a key scene in the movie, the discussion between Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (wonderfully played by Viola Davis), leading to an unexpected outcome.

And I think here is the doubt the movie is putting forward: more than the doubt of Sister James (is Father Flynn an abominable pedophile, beyond his openness?), more even than the doubt of Sister Aloysius (was she right in following a man without positive proofs?), there is the doubt of humanity. Human behavior is complex, each human case is unique and cannot be assimilated to a general pattern. Things aren't every time what they look like, we should always consider this question, what if?

"Doubt" dares to explore one of the most compelling issues of recent years, and to do so with a completely unmanipulative perspective with no sermonizing.

The linear narrative style is refreshing, with no flashbacks and flash forwards, and no contamination of the story (set in the early 1960s) with the hindsight of recent events. It is relentless. We see the events of those days without any cinematic deus ex machina. We are not privileged to any all-showing exposition of critical events. We have only the souls of the principles as expressed in their dialog and in their faces.

With the mighty acting duo of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and a more than able supporting cast and superb direction, "Doubt" has dramatic fireworks without cheap gimmicks.

The final 30 seconds puts a fitting cap on the message. The effect is devastating.

If I were sitting on a jury at Father Flynn's trial, I could not convict him simply because of lack of evidence.

Writer/director Shanley purposefully withholds information necessary for the viewer to know and decided Father Flynn's guilt or innocence.

Shanley wants us to confront the doubt and uncertainty inherent in life and states so explicitly in his interview on the DVD. That's his express aim, yet he stacks the deck. He demonizes Sister Beauvier, makes her the witch to Father Flynn's saint.

Odd, that Shanley wants us to appreciate the moral ambiguities of life, while painting this situation in such stark black-and-white terms, which are not true to life.

I doubt a mother would willingly sacrifice her son to a pedophile, as Mrs. Miller does. To say the least, it's a bit of a stretch. The choices offered Mrs. Miller are also unrealistically stark and simplified, life or death.

Some aspects of the human experience may indeed be unknowable and mysterious, thus inherently subject to uncertainty and doubt; but whether or not Father Flynn molested a boy is not one of these. It is, on the contrary, a simple fact, which Shanley does his best to keep hidden from the audience.

Although the movie is very skillfully done and the performances are sterling, it is fundamentally intellectually dishonest, a ruse.

The movie purports to force us to examine the process by which we make our moral decisions, to confront our biases, yet both grossly and actively distorts our perception of the world and hides significant parts of it from us. This simply isn't fair or honest.

Let me start by saying that I wasn't bored for one second and that it is always fascinating to see great actors chewing the scenery. Meryl Streep is one of my heroes she will always be be here something happened. Her performance is devoid of highs and/or lows. She goes through it in second gear. I had hoped for a performance of the Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchet with a pleasant almost benign exterior but a monstrous center and Philip Seymour Hoffman, another great, doesn't project any kind of sexual vibe so the sexual allegations may work on a stage play but not on the screen. The part needed a John Garfield. On top of that, there is something missing on the structure of the story. We're taken through two acts but the third act is missing. I didn't believe in that ending it felt to come out of left field. So yes, I was entertained but dissatisfied.

Doubt is almost a great film, but it falls short on logic. The many 10/10 ratings seem to refer more to what the film *should* have been, than to what it turned out to be.

For me, the main problem is the trick that Meryl Streep's nun plays on Hoffman's priest - lying about calling a nun in his old parish. This seems to reveal with far too much certainty that the man is indeed guilty - of something. If he wasn't expelled from previous positions, why does he not question the (supposed) phone call more strongly? If we are to believe that the priest resigns simply because he feels unable to fight the slander, then we should hear him say so. Instead, we see only that he's running away; apparently, the nun's tactic has worked.

As a result, the nun ends up looking far too 'right,' and the ending sounding far too glib. There's no other explanation offered, no discussion of ramifications or possibilities. Could the priest's obvious good works excuse some wrongdoing? The question is not asked, nor answered. On the other hand, is the nun right to be malicious and inflexible, because in the end she accomplishes the correct result? Apparently she is, since any ill effects - especially on the naive younger nun - are not really delved into. (They're suggested in one scene, then abandoned. If there have been no ill effects, then clearly the older nun was right.)

So far, the film's point of view is clear as mud. (In fact, various reviewers here have come to entirely different conclusions. That's not Doubt; that's just vague.)

On top of all this there's the historical perspective. I was actually IN Catholic schools at about this time, and I happen to know the real guilty party, beyond any Doubt: it was the Church as an institution. The film seems prepared to tackle this issue, but again fails to carry through. We have the older nun, representing the stiff, traditional past. Contrasted with the priest, who reflects the much-needed modernization brought in by Pope John XXIII. Yet it's the priest who ends up in the wrong. What are we to make of this?

And what about Meryl Streep's character - who quite accurately represents generations of venomous, domineering nuns who terrorized small children - a legacy of institutionalized bullying that did easily as much harm overall as any priestly molestations. Do we hate her for the harm she does? Well, it's not really shown. She's right every time she deals with a child, and none show any obvious ill effects of her domination. (Though I would suggest that in fact the film's characterizations are accurate; Catholic schools tended to either crush children's will, or turn them into obnoxious rebels. Both outcomes are represented in the film, but the point of what we're seeing is not raised.)

With all this in mind, Streep's final cry of "Oh, I'm so wracked with doubt!" sounds very hollow indeed. What is she so doubtful about?? She has absolute certainty that the priest was guilty. Is she just agonizing over the methods she used to defeat him? Could it be that the *real* doubt in this movie is merely whether or not the ends justify the means?? If so, how disappointing, when so many other questions have been raised! And how uninteresting, given that no real ill effects of her tactics are shown.

Which brings us to the central dramatic failing of the film. The real pivotal character of this story is clearly that of the younger, naive nun. She is the only character that undergoes a major transformation, and hence begs to be spotlighted. Yet we are left entirely unclear as to how the events of the film have affected her. Has she been poisoned by the elder nun's harsh attitudes? Or has she absorbed the love and humor of the (possibly flawed) priest? Or, ultimately, can she find a middle course, that would show a way forward for the Church: due caution, tempered with a love that puts the children's welfare first? Unfortunately, the film's ending veers away from this, THE key question, and focuses on Streep's deeply uninteresting "Doubt."

It seems like Shanley set out to create one of those knife's-edge dramas, where difficult questions are raised but not given absolute answers. But at some point he slipped off, ending up not with ambivalence and "Doubt," but with logic that's just muddled. Or maybe the gaps were filled by material that ended up on the cutting room floor. I had the strong feeling the film wanted to be about fifteen minutes longer. A bit more exposition might have at least told us what we were supposed to be in Doubt *about.*

On the positive side, I'd say that the film looks terrific, and the (three!) main performances are brilliant - even though constrained by by Shanley's confused script.

Doubt is all Dialogue, Acting and Weather

There is no doubt. Nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role and for Best Writing, Doubt is an acting tour de force. 

Remember this name. John Patrick Shanley. He is the writer of only a dozen movies, but a few of them are quite good. He wrote Alive with Ethan Hawke, Joe Versus the Volcano with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and the sweetheart maker, Moonstruck with Nicholas Cage and Cher (Oscar for screen writing).

The 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, this Broadway play is all dialog, acting, and weather. Cold weather. Cold northeastern winter weather. The kind that blows across your path, knocks down limbs in your way, obscures your vision and maybe makes you see things that aren't there. The kind of hard wind that blows away the fine line dividing right and righteous, wrong and wronged. The kind of cold Meryl Streep exposes as Viola Davies offers up her son to the bare bones of stark truths. 

Just as Shanley did with the play, none of the other actors know if Father Flynn is guilty. Yet, the Spartan dialog gives these accomplished angels their wings. Doubt floats with the power of their performances. Nary is a word wasted. Neither a look nor a glance spent unwisely.

"Doubt," Philip Seymour Hoffman's character says in the opening siloque, "can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty." 

With performances like Julia & Julie, Meryl Streep will soon be sweeping aside all other acting award records. Those who love her need look no further than Doubt for proof of her incredible talents.

Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis and John Patrick Shanley follow in her footsteps. They track her out of the warmth of what you think you know is right and good and into a shivering Bronx, dusted with unfeeling snow. 8/16/2009 

Love these lines!

Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)in Doubt:

Well, I'm not going to let her keep this parish in the dark ages! And I'm not going to let her destroy my spirit of compassion!

That I can look at your face and know your philosophy. It's kindness.

There are people who go after your humanity, Sister, that tell you the light in your heart is a weakness. Don't believe it. It's an old tactic of cruel people to kill kindness in the name of virtue. There's nothing wrong with love.

Doubt, as it is most commonly known in its many manifestations and  forms, is often antagonised as a weakness, or a fault in virtue. Yet,  somewhat dubiously overlooked is its antithetic counterpart who comes  in the form of belief, faith, conviction, or unwavering assertion.  Indeed, how far will a person tread down a road guided only by their  intuition and trust in faith alone? These questions which in turn  reflect and pave way for many of Doubt's most potent and engaging  moments of narrative, are of course brought up in the course of the  adapted play's screenplay, but they are not answeredat least, not  directly. 
In fact, rather ironically, doubt is a feature that places the pieces  of the moral puzzle in question upright onto the table, and then leaves  them there; dangling and free to interpretation of each who sits down  to observe. This somewhat open-ended, vague and subjective form of  cinematic expression is something that is rarely seen outside of art  houses and the most daring of film-makers palettes. And yet  director/writer and playwright John Patrick Shanley implements the  risky move here with ease and grace. Yet the real flavour, despite  having plenty of potency within these realms, lies outside of debating,  suspicions and tests of virtuefirst and foremost, doubt is a study of  human characters, and how they can often clash as a result of their  diversities in opinions and temperaments. 
The majority of Doubt's story then is central to three catalysts for  the script's themes to manifest and evolve. These three personas come  in the form of a reserved, progressively adapted priest by the name of  Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman); a young, bright-eyed newcomer  nun named Sister James (Amy Adams); and a stern, assertive and  conniving traditionalist nun named Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep).  While it would be of no fault of anyone to assume that the themes I  have mentioned thus far have everything and all to do with the question  of religious faith only, this tangent however relevant and vital to the  backdrop of the story, nevertheless serves as just thata backdrop.  Instead Doubt takes its intellectual conflict between heart and reason  in the form of a cloudy event involving father Flynn and a young  alter-boy who takes a certain liking to the father-like-figure of the  priest. After hearing a notably unsure and reserved report from Sister  James, Sister Beauvier asserts that she knows what is going on with  Flynn, and that she's going to set everything straight. 
But what then, is her evidence? Not much. In fact, aside from word of  mouth (gossip, you could decree) from a young, naïve woman not sure  even of her own words, Beauvier has nothing but her suspicion and  conviction to go on. From here on in then, it is the sole intent of the  director to address the themes of doubt itself, and its oppressor,  being the Absolute Truth, or so it is perceived by those who take heed  of its obvious presence. How Shanley delivers his story is nothing  short of engrossing however; the whole structure of the play sees  characters sway from one end of the moral spectrum to the otherindeed,  it's startling as a viewer to find such palpitating changes of heart  regarding characters. 
Sure enough, the whole affair comes across as overtly manipulative  because of the amount of ambiguity and twists and turns that Shanley  throws out there, but taken in context of the movie's themes of  mistrust, unfaltering conviction and the inability for compassionate  re-evaluation, Doubt reflects its ideas in the head of its viewer  without blatantly pointing out such shifts; the emotional tugs are  indeed obvious, but the strings pulling them, are not. 
Yet for all intents and purposes, Doubt exists as a fine testament not  only to Shanley's ability as a film-maker, but also his ability to  direct his cast, and to allow them to envelop the characters from  within his emotionally contorted monster. Taking forefront for obvious  reasons here are both Hoffman and Streep who deliver performances just  as convincing and engaging as their characters are written. Hoffman  himself has seen a vast array of roles (specifically from 2008) which  have made him a figure to watch from here on in, but Streep, despite  her accolades from previous years, has found herself in some lacklustre  roles as of late. Doubt then, with its rich, multi-dimensional  characters and interpersonal relations, finds Streep back at home,  embodying her persona with vigour and a conviction that always finds  the audience clamouring at her feet, but not at the expense of  maintaining their attention. 
It's a somewhat humble, unassuming feature as a whole that will be  easily misinterpreted by a few, but only a few. Instead, those looking  for intelligent, layered and tangible character drama laced with plenty  of thematic conjecture will find much to enjoy here. Of course, there  is every reason to believe that the feature's lack of resolution or  clear, objective stances will disgruntle those dimmed into expectations  of cathartic, solidified resolvesbut this in turn is the point of  Doubt. Not only does it offer up food for thought, intrigue the heart  and question the nature of our own convictions we may hold dear, but it  also echoes those themes through its unavoidably ambiguous and  unknowing nature. 
One thing that certainly is clear here however, is that Doubt exists as  a complex, significant feature, brimming with subdued, nuanced life and  important statements beyond which most cinematic fare avoids in favour  of comfortable, solidified answers; it's a bold statement, and an  endlessly intriguing and engrossing one at that.

This was the most unsettling movie I have seen in many years. Throughout the showing I found myself wandering back and forth between condemnation of the Priest's behaviour, the Principal's behaviour and the behaviour of the young black student's Mother. The part of the traditional nun who is principal of a Catholic School is played perfectly by Meryl Streep. She's unhappy with change and views it almost as a loss of the comfort and peace of mind that comes with tradition. The part of the new Priest is played just as perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He views change in the way religion is practiced as absolutely essential and wants to see the iron fisted traditional rule of the principal disappear into the dark, inflexible past where it belongs. Thus, from the beginning of the movie there is a silent war between the two main characters. If you are a trusting and positive person, you may find yourself believing that the new priest is a wonderful man who cares about nothing more than the religious health and happiness of the parishioners and young students of his church. The affection that he displays for the troubled young black student at the centre of the controversy is touching and absolutely appropriate. On the other hand, if you are a more cynical person, likely to be suspicious of any behaviour that strays from the reserved understanding that a priest traditionally expresses in a more sombre way to his parishioners and students, then you may quickly decide that he is all of the things that the principal suspects him to be. In the end, the principal wins out and succeeds in driving the new priest out of the parish. He moves on to another parish where he has greater responsibilities and enjoys a higher level of professional respect. But I, the viewer, am left wondering if the principal is a paranoid cast back to 17th century religious practices, who victimizes a new priest simply because he represented change that she wasn't prepared to accept, or if the new Priest actually is an abuser who took advantage of a young vulnerable boy who had no one to turn to for comfort, but was ferreted out by a wise, no nonsense adherent to purity in religion.

John Patrick Shanley directs "Doubt". The plot? A Catholic nun accuses a priest of abusing a child. She has no evidence, but trusts her instincts. He did it. Others disagree, but she insists. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing. A scheming, self-serving man who sings sermons of tolerance, love and the dangers of gossip only as a smokescreen for his own wicked ways. She will catch him, and her brand of militant Christianity will cast him away!

The priest, of course, denies ever committing abuse. He insists that the nun is deeply misguided. She, he believes, is an authoritarian figure who has turned Christianity into a religion of fear, suspicion and intolerance. She, he insists, is on a quest to expunge symbols of tolerance and "progressivism" from the Church.

What follows is an epic battle of truth, doubt, denial and suspicion, but more importantly, a battle between two heavy weight acting legends. Meryl Streep plays the nun and Philip Seymour Hoffman the priest, and when the duo square off in a single room towards the film's climax, its hard not to grin. They spout dialogue like arrows, trade gazes like cannon fire, both actors showing shades of vulnerability, weakness, strength and righteousness. Who do we trust? Who do we side with? Who is right? Who is wrong? That the film keeps us enthralled and guessing so long is a testament to a tight script and some brilliant performances by both Streep and Hoffman.

8/10  An excellent drama, marred only by an overly tidy ending. Makes a good companion piece to "The Magdalene Sisters" and "Black Narcissus".

I was disappointed, not in the acting, but in just about everything else. I read some encouraging reviews, and as the movie started Meryl Streep took me back to my teacher, Sister J. . As Streep wandered the aisles of Church and school, I said to myself, "Yes, this is an accurate scene. This is just how it happened." However, what was the purpose of this movie, and what is it's message? This is where I am deflated, let down and discouraged. I thought perhaps that the writers don't really have the insight into the real world of the Catholic Church just the periphery. Sure, recent years have uncovered a plethora of pedophiles, and if more was said of the movie in this, perhaps maybe the better, but little was said, just inferred. It seems that the message of this movie is it's title, and as the not so good Father tells us in the opening sermon, we can all find unity in having the same flaw. WHAT!!!??? This is a secular pile of dung. If priests and nuns wrote this movie they would write and act of doubt's antithesis, the all important credo in unity, which is Faith. Now, writers and audience alike may criticize my viewpoint, saying it is I who don't understand, but that is what I think is all wrong...with the world viewpoint and with this movie. I hate to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but the end says it all. In the end, Streep becomes a bad person. The movie tells us Father Flynn's next residence is larger and therefore puts more boys at greater risk, not to mention that Streep.... Well, I don't have to tell you if you want to watch it.

I have another problem with the movie as to how it handled the Miller boy. The movie let's us believe one thing, but the boy never shows any signs of being of a certain orientation, only the word of his mother in close conversation. Was the movie's point that gay boys attract the pedophiles? That whole line was confusing, and arguably underdeveloped. Point is if you're going to divulge the conversation with the Mother than something more has to be done with the subject matter, even if it's closed off quickly.

I can't recommend this movie except for the individual performances of Adams, Seymour and Streep (order by alpha or ind. rating, take your pick). They were all fantastic. I just wish they had a better script with which to work.

John Patrick Shanley's film is of his own successful stage play. Rather like Arthur Miller's The Crucible we are presented with a thriller with an ecclesiastical backdrop, where warped righteousness and power prevail in a moral fog. I have to say that on a first viewing, Shanley's film sells itself thinly. In a wonderful script he creates a vast penumbra of terrors (both ethical and social). Yet, by the close, none of these foibles or even the paranoia that they instigate has been really addressed. We do not know what has happened behind the scenes during the film, which is fine, but we need to have more about its fallout and assimilation. Sister Aloysius' final, crumbling coda is insufficient.

Shanley could not have had a better ensemble advocate for this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Flynn is the antithesis of Meryl Streep's Aloysius; worldly, sensitive and vulnerable. Perhaps needless to say that tear the screen up with the intensity of their escalating confrontation - their restraint only focuses their resolve and ire. Amy Adams holds her own in this company.

However, the deep, dark heart of the film is in Aloysius' conference with Mrs Miller (the mother of the boy around whom assumptions and accusations are spawned). This is a sequence of first-class cinema in which arguably the finest two women actors in America grasp at the evanescent poles of propriety, morality and social reality. Viola Davis was robbed of a Best Supporting Oscar for this performance, without question.

The film looks rather stagey, as one might expect as Shanley has only got behind a camera once before. Nonetheless it looks fine (Roger Deakins has photographed it well) and Shanley wisely uses some light Hitchcockian touches (diagonal framing) to warm it up. Indeed I couldn't help thinking about I Confess, Hitchcock's masterful, entertaining adventure into the extremities of Catholic absolutism vs reality. This film is not that exciting - nor is it quite as forensic as The Crucible - but it is well-performed and impressive. 7/10

Like "Catholic Boys" (aka "Heaven Help Us"), "Doubt" is set in the mid sixties in a Catholic school in New York and, like that film and many others set in that particular decade, uses its sixties setting as a kind of cinematic shorthand for "clash between progressive values and conservative ones". There is, of course, a major difference between the two films. "Catholic Boys" is a comedy which uses this clash as a source of humour, some of it satirical. "Doubt" is a deeply serious film; one might even say a tragedy.

The clash between tradition and progress was particularly intense within the Catholic Church at this date, as this was the period of the reforming Second Vatican Council which sat between 1962 and 1965. (The film itself is set in 1964). The two sides are represented by Father Flynn, the liberal parish priest, and Sister Aloysius, the strict Principal of the school attached to the church. It is notable that Sister Aloysius has on the wall of her office a picture not of Paul VI, who would have been the incumbent Pope in 1964, nor of his immediate predecessor John XXIII, who was responsible for convening Vatican II, but of John's predecessor Pius XII, regarded by many Catholics as a champion of conservative values.

The two dislike one another intensely, and the main action of the film concerns Sister Aloysius's suspicions about the relationship between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, an altar boy. Donald has recently been admitted to the school as its only black student, a development which has aroused resentment among some of the other pupils and their parents. (A reminder that, although we normally associate segregation with the Deep South, the Northern states also had their own forms of racial discrimination). Sister Aloysius begins to suspect that Father Flynn has been sexually abusing the boy and, although she has no real evidence to support her suspicions, begins a campaign to force him to resign. As the film progresses, our sympathies shift first to one side, then to the other. At times we begin to fear that Sister Aloysius's suspicions may be well-founded; at others it seems as though she has launched a spiteful campaign of persecution against a blameless man for no other reason than that she dislikes his theology. Much of her dislike of him, in fact, seems to be centred on trivial reasons, such as that he writes with a ballpoint pen rather than a fountain pen and that he takes too much sugar in his tea.

"Doubt" is based upon a stage play by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the screenplay and directed the film. With its limited range of settings (mostly interiors) and lengthy dialogues, the film clearly betrays its theatrical origins. Nevertheless, Shanley is able to turn these features of the film into strengths. The indoor settings suggest a sense of claustrophobia; when the characters venture outside they often seem trapped between tall buildings. The action takes place in autumn and winter and the weather we see outside (grey skies, a thunderstorm, snow) seems to reflect the characters' emotions. Although the film is set in the sixties, the style of decor of the rooms, and most of the furniture, suggests a date several decades before that, adding to the atmosphere of intellectual conservatism.

Although dialogue predominates over physical action, that is no weakness when the dialogue is spoken by actors as talented as Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams as the naive young Sister James, who is initially responsible for arousing Sister Aloysius's suspicions about the priest but later comes to accept his explanations. There is also a good cameo from Viola Davis as Donald's mother Ida who asks Sister Aloysius not to pursue her suspicions. Ida believes her son to be gay and sees Father Flynn as the only man who has ever shown him kindness. All four received Oscar nominations, but none of them won. I felt, in fact, that Streep was better than Kate Winslet who won for "The Reader". Winslet's performance was technically good but with an emotional and spiritual void at the centre, whereas Streep, putting the ghastly "Mamma Mia" behind her, gave one of her best performances. Nevertheless, Streep already has two Oscars whereas Winslet had previously been nominated five times without success. You do the maths.

(Incidentally, I wonder if Streep ever will win a third Oscar; her second, for "Sophie's Choice" came as long ago as 1983, although she has received eleven nominations since. There sometimes seems to be an unofficial rule that if you've already got two Oscars you cannot win a third. Unless your name is Katharine Hepburn).

The theme of doubt runs through the film. It opens with Father Flynn giving a sermon on the nature of doubt and concluding that like faith, it can be a unifying force. It ends, after Flynn has been forced to resign, with Aloysius admitting in tears to Sister James, "I have such doubts". I must admit that I was disappointed by the ending which seems too abrupt and does not clarify the nature of Aloysius's doubts. Did she mean doubts about her faith in general, or doubts about Flynn's guilt? Or doubts about the justice of a God who can allow a guilty man to go unpunished? (After he resignation Flynn was transferred by the Church authorities to another, more prestigious, parish; effect a promotion). It is certainly true that in some cases an outward show of certainty can mask inner doubts and conflicts, but as Aloysius has hitherto appeared a person of unshakable convictions, untroubled by doubts of any kind, this sudden, unexplained revelation comes as a shock. A greater emphasis on her psychological development and a less hurried ending might have made for a stronger film.

With that one reservation, however, I found "Doubt" to be a powerful, well-written and well-acted drama, one of the best films of 2008. 8/10

Many people stay in abusive relationships because by being hurt they're getting some form of attention.

The mother of the boy in the movie Doubt uses such an excuse to justify supporting the priest accused of molesting her child. Inasmuch as her husband routinely beats their son (which mom does nothing to stop), she believes the kid at least receives some kindly attention from the priest.

You want to cry over her and the plight of the world that allows unremitting evil. It's the only scene where one feels this way. Paradoxically, Doubt is too successful in its premise as it otherwise leaves one saddled with doubt as to guilt or innocence and the lead actors behave so ambiguously as to appear amorphous.

Even the youngster gives no clue as to what if anything is going on. Alright, we thankfully are spared actually witnessing his being pummeled or possibly being seduced, but with absolutely nothing dramatized his performance comes across as indifferently as most others.

Yet I wish to stress the value of the film. If life is filled with doubt, if you can't believe anything anyone says, if nobody seems motivated by righteousness, well, Doubt gives a compelling confirmation. God help us all.

I was not a fan of Doubt when it was on Broadway. I liked it but didn't love it,certainly not Pulitzer worthy. I found it too much of a problem play where people sit around and discuss ideas in ways that were meant to explore the ideas more then they were meant to be real. I found Sister Aloysius monstrous and almost comical. I did think it was nicely compact and did what it did and got off.

It was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch John Patrick Shanley's film of his play. My reaction was less than I had hoped.

The plot has Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) suspecting that all is not right with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), particularly with his relationship with one of the boys in the school. There is no evidence that anything really happened but the Sister is damn certain something did and she is going to make sure that Father Flynn is removed. As events occur that can be taken any number of ways the heat increases and a battle of wills transpires.

In opening up his play Shanley has brought the story closer to the real world. There are more characters, more events and many characters are deepened. Unfortunately, in my eyes anyway, the resulting opening up has made Sister Aloysius seem almost laughable. To be certain she is a monster of epic proportions and I know that there are and were many nuns (and people) who are very similar to her but what worked on stage as a symbol of the stone like past of the church and the world, refusing to change, comes off on screen, in the real world, as a caricature. I found her silly and I found I was giggling more than anything else, especially with her ever shifting accent. Several critics in their reviews of the film said they found Streep to be in another movie from the rest of the cast, and in some ways I did too. Its the construction of the character, as I said she is the symbol of stagnation in a world of change, and she is more archetype then real person. She is just a rigid construct and not a real person, this would have worked on stage but not in a reality based film. (And mark my words its going to be role that becomes spoofed for years to come to the point of becoming a cliché) 

The battle between stage and the screen is all over the film. What was a series of scenes on the stage where people effectively sat around and talked about what they have seen or might have seen now become a series of scenes where we actually see the events.For me the opening up of the play makes the story not one full of doubt, rather one that seems confused. Events that on stage were only revealed as events others saw transpire are now seen by all to happen. The angst some characters feel at what they saw is now lessened because we see the events (the locker) for example. We also have to contend with a a vastly increased number of characters (the original play had four) so additionally the story is shaded by actually seeing all of these people. How can we feel the uncertainty of what the sisters saw or feel when we see the same events. On some level, the very thing the film is about, doubt, is removed because we see things.

I know its not fair to compare the film with the play, since they are different, but at the same time I couldn't stop doing so because there were things the film was doing that didn't work for me (as opposed to the recent Frost Nixon which transcended it stage origins into something truly cinematic). Perhaps Ihad I not been exposed to the play I might have liked this better. As it stands now I found it a good but not great adaptation of a good but not great play.

I was taken aback by the lack of nuance and subtlety. Meryl Streep is a monstrous nun from the very beginning and Philip Seymour Hoffman is a wimp that can shout but remains a wimp. I just didn't believe any of it, which is a pity because this are among my favorite actors of all time. I think that John Patrick Shanley (the writer, director) didn't have enough muscle to handle this enormous talents. Meryl's nun couldn't hide anywhere, she carries her intolerance, frustration and repression on her sleeve. She knows she is hated but according to her, that's her job. No, I didn't believe it. I thought what Vanessa Redgrave, Liv Ullman, Helen Mirren even Cherry Jones who played her on the stage could have done with this creature and then, Philip Seymour Hoffman's priest, without a single vibe of sexuality, imagine what Montgomery Clift could have done with that! After saying what I've said I also have to add that the film is never boring and that is also merit of the miscast leads. They are great fun to watch. The film is dedicated to Sister James, the young nun played by the wonderful Amy Adams, so this is based on a real case? I don't believe that either.

Unlike with other films, instead of counting the plot holes I am counting the cunning devices and remarkable performances and marveling at the dialogue and how everything fits together. I couldn't find any flaws, so I'm giving it 10 stars.

So many powerful scenes here, including the confrontation, the talk on the park bench between Father Flynn and young Sister James, and the walk with Donald's mother.

I thought because it was about religion it might get tedious, but I just wanted to rewind.

Self-righteous principal Sister Aloysius suspects impropriety from her priest on a hunch, and determines to bring him down. She knows the delicate situation as he is her superior, but she plows ahead. He gets very angry at the accusations. Ordinarily to me this indicates guilt, but that it no doubt just another clever ploy in this wonderful script..

When I heard his sermon that opened the movie, I definitely thought the doubt he was addressing was doubt of your faith, which I'm sure is a very common issue among every priest's parishioners. What do you say to that? It can't be easy to write a sermon...or even just to not put everybody to sleep, let alone to convince the doubters. I thought it was a fine sermon. But already this woman insisted on reading something into it that wasn't there, and began building her case.

I know this type of abuse goes on and is dreadful and I don't mean to defend it in any way, but I also know that people can be framed and that also angers me. And this film shows how it could be done even by a well-meaning and upstanding person.

That everyone in this film got an Oscar nomination was no surprise, and I think it was only due to a strong field that there were no wins.

Meryl Streep is nothing short of amazing. She never made a wrong move. It was fascinating to watch the way her character swung so easily from unreasonably cruel to glimmers of humanity.

The lead actor was brilliantly cast in Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose sleazy expressions combined with his hairstyle to make him look like he could be a pedophile; while his kindly expressions and ideas and actions made him seem like the model priest...for the perfect balance of good and bad. In every scene I kept thinking how incredible to be able to make yourself look so convincingly innocent, yet also make yourself look guilty at the same time. Mesmerizing.

Viola Davis stunned. She delivered lines that sounded so unfeeling and unlikely, and made them believable to your very core. Heartbreaking, raw, real. Amy Adams was also deserving, but her role was more subtle.

We never find out for sure if Father Flynn is guilty or innocent. I know what I believe, based on what we are shown of his actions and his character, but without true evidence, that is all there is to go on. In other words, just like life.

Father Flynn advocates loving children. He's a little sleazy, he's got long nails, he smokes, he wants to modernize the Church... They throw just enough at you to make you...doubt.

Doubt is a very well played movie, an escalating conflict between the characters of Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Streep plays the nun Beauvier that suspects Father Flynn, the parish priest, to have an improper relationship with a young boy in the church's school. In a series of confrontations the pressure and tension between them rises until one of them must break. Is Beauvier's suspicions correct? There are clues that support her feeling. Or are Flynn's explanations, that are plausible, how it is? In the middle, between them, is Sister James. She has doubts. Whom is correct? 

It is a decent plot that is augmented by great acting. It is a thrill to see Streep and Hoffman to go up against another. The plot, however, is thinner, even with the mounting suspense. Part of it is that the audience is also held in doubt. Since the title and theme is what it is I can understand why that is done, and in part it does help to build the tension. But I'm not sure it is the right one in the end. The movie ends without really revealing the truth, or give any real ending at all, and some part of me wants a conclusion. I know it is simplistic and that the truth is in reality impossible to know, and perhaps during the circumstances not important. But the movie-watcher in me that wants to be entertained feels a little cheated.

The character Sister James is used a little oddly. In the beginning she is in the middle of it. She is the one that makes the observations that leads to the suspicions. It is in her classroom that many clues are found. She is the character that tries to find the moral balance in the story, that tries to find the truth, proofs, and not be lead by her own preconceptions. Early on she seems to be the character that pushes the story forward, but later on she suddenly disappears, she needs to go to a sick brother, and only appears briefly at the end. I wonder if the story would have unveiled more naturally in Sister James' perspective, not clouded by any convictions. Her uncertainty would have given the suspense some edge.

The acting is well worth the Academy Awards it got nominated for, and the story is set in an interesting context, considering the news from recent years. However, as a movie it lacked an edge to me. It might be the concealed truth, it might be Sister James' disappearance, it might be something else.
