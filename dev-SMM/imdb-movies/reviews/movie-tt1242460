### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
We need to talk about Kevin is easily one of the most harrowing films I've ever seen and left me completely empty. Lynne Ramsey succeeds where so many others dealing with a similar subject matter have failed, as she abstains from sensationalism and bloody detail. Instead she focuses in on character and relationship development and breakdown.

Tilda Swinton gives a truly great performance and even though the main thread of the story is clear almost from the start, she and the rest of the terrific cast manage to keep the viewer glued to the screen.

One of the most interesting facets of the film was that it showed how much power children can hold and execute over adults if they are given the opportunity.

We need to talk about Kevin is quality from start to finish and deserves to become a classic. I'm looking forward to seeing many more films by Lynne Ramsay.

Lynne Ramsay's film is a tour de force of economy. There's not a single shot wasted. Not a moment goes by that isn't informing, telling the story, adding to the cumulative exploration of a dysfunctional mother- son relationship and its purgatorial fall-out. It's also a rather gentle film (dare I say it, a feminine film): the narrative is constantly split between past and present, the tone moving between all-pervasive paranoia, drudge and romance. The movement isn't jerky though, with regular pacing of the flashing back and forwards, meticulously edited cuts and a very clever original + co-opted soundtrack that often works in contrary motion to the tone, smoothing it out.

This is a film about a mother confronting motherhood across an overlapping three-act structure: before Kevin's birth, with Kevin, after Kevin's crime. Tilda Swinton is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for her assumption of the role, her selection of uncomprehending thousand yard stares far removed from the opaque look favoured by many other actors working to this level. It helps that the three Kevins who play the title role are all uniformly superb as well - hideous, sly, handsome.

It's the visuals that pulled me up and pressed me back down over and over. The opening 5 minutes or so are worth more than many hours of mediocre film making that I'm perfectly happy to sit through as a general rule in a cinema: the Boschian Tomatina fight, with the equivocal vision of a blissed out Eva buried in the blood red Sartrean- viscous filth is a particularly arresting opening statement (think of the bleaching-white flour of Morvern Callar). It's not an easy watch, although there is no sensationalism. It is, however, always poetry. 9/10

This is quite simply one of the best films of the year. Even the book's author, Lionel Shriver (a woman) praises the film, calling it 'a brilliant adaptation'. Being a first-time dad, the story fascinated me. What happens if you don't love your own child... and they know it? 

Tilda Swinton, not normally a favourite of mine, is exceedingly good as Eva, the mum uninterested in maternity. Gravid when she least wants to be (she's career-minded), out pops Kevin, her little Damien. You know from the moment she refuses skin-to-skin things are not going to bode well. 

She has no idea how to deal with a baby. Her idea of subduing him is to stand next to a pneumatic drill to drown out his relentless screaming. Kevin grows up knowing he is unloved and demonstrates this through devilish behaviour towards Eva. 

Gradually Eva, if not embraces motherhood, then at least gets better at it. Perhaps this is due to her giving birth to her second child, a girl, who Kevin of course hates with a passion. Or maybe the idea of being a mum sinks in, along with the realisation that a career is not the most important thing in life.

Eva's betterments do nothing to placate Kevin: he gets worse. Eva's attempts to complain are met with ridicule by the father (John C. Reilly), who thinks she is delusional. Years of unintentional, but sometimes intentional, neglect take their toll on Kevin, and the film's tragic conclusion seems inevitable.

The origin for Kevin's behaviour has polarised audiences. Did Eva create a monster by failing to form a bond early on? Should she have sought help from professionals if she felt she wasn't coping? Or was Kevin simply a bad seed; an innately evil child who no one could have cured? 

Now that I've had the chance to reflect, I think it's unfair to judge son or mother. I'd be surprised if Ramsay wanted audiences to do that. What would be the point? The film is a starkly brilliant exploration of a failed relationship and the consequences that has on a family and an entire community. 

If Swinton can win an Oscar so easily for her role in 'Michael Clayton', she should be celebrating her second win now. It's one of those performances which needs months of detoxification and psychoanalysis to move on from. Her acting is matched by new-kid-on-the-block Ezra Miller, who plays her lovelorn son. He brings to his role a controlled ferocity we are not used to seeing. His portrayal works, apart from his first-class acting, because he's not the stereotype. To look at him, you would say he was handsome and ingenuous. But looks are deceptive. 

It's hard for people to be repulsed by films nowadays, but there are scenes which will shock. So rare is it to see this kind of film. They vanish as quickly as they appear. I implore you to see this if you can. You'll be moved if not entertained.

I saw this film at Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) prior to its general release. This is not a film I would choose to see normally, based on its subject matter. However, as a festival-goer, this was what was offered for the late evening screening. This film is visually stunning, and masterfully composed. You know early-on that a Columbine-style ending is inevitable, nonetheless hope that some miracle may yet occur to avert this disaster. Swinton is absolutely magnificent (as always) as the mother desperately trying to cope with raising a psychopathic child, but equally impressive are the performances of the actors who portray the developmental stages of Kevin from early childhood to the brink of adulthood. What elevates this film is the visual and musical narrative that accompanies the initial time-skipping introduction and then the more linear progression of Kevin's growth to its final, terrible conclusion. Interestingly, the emotional crescendo of the film occurs not near the end when Kevin carries out his horrific violence, but rather in the middle of the film at moments when we observe the impossibility of living a "normal" family life with a child who is incapable of feeling or expressing the human emotions that bind us together.

After watching this film twice in two days I can honestly say it is among the most affecting and gripping movies I have ever seen. The use of sound and the wonderful camera work made my hair stand on end. I enjoyed it even more the second time as I was able to make sense of the opening scenes without straining myself, this however is not a criticism; rather it is a testament to the intellect and emotional power of a film where every member of cast and crew excel themselves. Sadness, joy, pain, nostalgia, elation and confusion are just a fraction of the feelings this roller-coaster provokes, and the audience's sheer awe was summed up by the 10 seconds of breathless silence as the screen faded into credits before an eruption of applause broke out.......Astounding.

Greetings again from the darkness. The Brady Bunch, this isn't. It's also not the place to look for helpful parenting tips. In fact, the story revolves around Eva, a woman (Tilda Swinton) who apparently didn't want to have a child ... at least not at this time, and certainly not THIS child. If you have seen The Omen, you probably gave thanks that you didn't have a child like Damien. At least we knew Damien was the spawn of Satan. Eva's son Kevin, is instead a good old fashioned psychopath. One who has an inherent need to cause pain and misery for his mother.

What a pair Eva and Kevin make. From day one, Kevin seems to sense his mother's lack of joy in parenthood. And he seems to have a genetic disposition of making her pay. As with many psychopaths, his above average intelligence makes him even more dangerous. He is tricky enough to keep his dad (John C Riley) clueless as to his nature, while causing much doubt in the dad's mind as to the stability of his wife.

My favorite part is actually how director Lynne Ramsay structured the storytelling. It goes beyond non-linear and actually bounces throughout three key periods: Kevin as a baby/toddler, Kevin as a 6-8 year old (Jason Newell), and Kevin as a teenager (Ezra Miller). Each age is progressively more frightening and disenchanting, and the film begins with what is an undetermined catastrophe. This event is slowly revealed over the course of the movie, though we witness events leading up to it, as well as the resulting fallout.

There are a few scenes where Eva is scrubbing the exterior of her house in an attempt to remove the red paint that was purposefully splattered. As a viewer, we understand that she has blood on her hands and she seems resigned to the fact that she is now a social outcast, even a pariah. We spend much of the movie in Eva's jumbled thoughts as she tries to piece together what has happened and why. Of course, there is no answer. The title explains what was missing all along. There was no communication and no willingness to confront the problem ... a psychopathic son. To say they all paid the price is an understatement.

This film has a very limited audience, though my claim is that Ms. Swinton was quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. She wears defeat like a mask and lives in isolation better than most could. Even the music is offbeat and unusual in its use ... thanks to Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. As filmmaking, this is high art. As storytelling, it's a bit muddled and quite a downer.

While the idea behind "We Need to Talk About Kevin" is exceptional, I was put off by the direction of this film. While I know that a non-linear way of film making is popular these days, it's often overused--and here it is not used effectively. Too many times, the film jumps about in time and this took me out of the experience. This makes the film too unnecessarily confusing--so I am glad that I knew the plot so I could understand what was happening. Additionally, the film used a very deliberate artsy style--such as the overuse of the color red (the tomato fight, the stack of tomato soup cans, the paint)--resulting in sledgehammer symbolism. For me, the story was very strong on its own and didn't need all these tricks.

Tilda Swinton stars as a mother of a child who is seriously disturbed. However, her husband (John C. Reilly) is in complete denial and inexplicably the kid is never taken to see a therapist (or exorcist). As the film progresses, the child grows from an Oppositional-Defiant child to a cold and ruthless sociopath as a teen. You never ever hear about how he is perceived by teachers and neighbors--an odd omission. However, including the child killing animals, having one of the parents in complete denial, sexually offensive behavior and the hasty behavior towards his sister are all excellent touches--which I noticed since I used to work with folks like this (which would explained why I eventually gave up being a therapist and became a teacher). Unfortunately, as the film is out of sequence, you already know that sooner or later this will all lead to Kevin committing some atrocities.

Overall, this is a very compelling but frustrating film. I already talked about the film style which left me flat, but I also thought it very odd how the only one who seemed to notice anything unusual about Kevin was his mom. Even clever sociopaths are noticeable--perhaps not to everyone but to only be apparent to one person? Odd... The film is worth seeing but it just misses the mark for me--it could have been great.

Touted as the "feel-good movie of the year" by those who are most sarcastic, "We Need to Talk About Kevin" could not be further from the truth.

Golden-Globe-nominated Tilda Swinton, who should have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance over even Meryl Streep, plays Eva Khatchadourian, a woman who never quite connects with her son, who becomes increasingly unstable and savage as he grows older, resulting in a high-school killing spree.

An absolutely disturbing film about the possible outcome of parental disconnect, "Kevin" is an incredibly honest and frightening look at a mother who tries to build a relationship with her son while knowing, deep down, there is really no feelings there at all. Swinton, with her facial expressions and perfect body language, is so incredibly affective and riveting as the desperate mother, both while Kevin is growing up and when we see her life after the massacre. I have difficulty finding the words to express the emotions that her performance stirs as you see how much she suffers while not understanding how a mother could give birth to a child she doesn't love.

Kevin, played by three young actors who look so incredibly alike, it's almost creepy, is so compelling, whether played by a toddler named Rock Duer, a child named Jasper Newell or teenage Ezra Miller, the mere presence of any incarnation of him on screen will make your skin crawl.

The film is so very affecting because most cannot imagine a situation such as this, yet the film is not supposed to be presented as a horror film. There is no supernatural evil at work here. I am sure this happens in real life, hopefully with not such a shocking and truly gruesome outcome. You watch in horror as the lack of emotion from the mother is frightening, yet when you see the actions of this child, you cannot help but have empathy for Eva, even though she almost comes across as unwillingly abusive at times. The film is set up in somewhat jarring flashbacks (which really should have received an Oscar nomination for editing) as you see a completely broken Eva dealing with the aftermath of her son's actions as she reflects on the upbringing of a child who grows into a person without feeling.

No, "Kevin" is NOT the feel-good movie of the year. In fact, it is a difficult film to watch. You should not go see this film if wanting to leave the theatre with a smile on your face. However, as a character study, this film is one of the most affecting that I have seen in a long time, and if there is one actress who was robbed of an Oscar nomination, it is indeed Swinton, who is nothing short of brilliant.

We Need to Talk About Kevin is certainly a movie that will be every  parent and would-be parent's worst nightmare. This movie gained a lot  of praise at the Cannes Film Festival and attempts to explore the  themes of society, parenting and psychology. 
Eva Khachaturian (Tilda Swinton) is a middle-aged mother hated by her  community and struggling with the aftermath of a tragedy. Her  sociopathic teenage son, Kevin (Ezra Miller), has committed a school  massacre and she has to deal with the results of the sins of her child  and explore how Kevin turned out this way in a dual narrative. 
After being unable to make her version of The Lovely Bones, Lynne  Ramsey turned to adapting this Lionel Shriver novel instead. She  delivers a haunting, slow-moving film that looks at the personal and  social impact of the tragedy through one person's eyes as well looking  at the struggles of raising a troubled child. Ramsey made sure there  was a grim, somber tone and kept a minimalist view of the world, yet  still adds her own visual flair with intense, slow close ups and red  imagery throughout the film to symbolise blood on Eva's hands. 
There is a deliberately disjointed narrative throughout the movie,  cutting from the present to the past as we examine Eva's inability to  bond with her son. Ramsey took the bold step to avoid showing any of  the actual massacre and most violence is committed off screen. We do  not need to see it to understand its impact on people. Nor did we see  Kevin's preparations for the massacre: We Need to Talk About Kevin is  Eva's story, not Kevin's. 
But there is a major problem with Ramsay's approach to the story: she  seems to ignore the entire concept of nature vs. nurture. Eva being  portrayed as a bad mother is outweighed by the way Kevin is shown as  practically the product of Satan's loins. Throughout the film, Kevin is  always pushing his mother's buttons and made out to be evil from the  day he is born. There is no subtlety in his portrayal, even with basic  things like reaction shots. We Need to Talk About Kevin should have  been more ambiguous, because the whole point of the film is to raise a  debate. The audience is not meant to have a clear answer. 
Swinton's performance was highly praised and she is worthy of an Oscar  nomination as her character Eva, who starts off both as a woman at a  real low end and her struggles with a child she does not want. She is a  disaster of a mum to Kevin as a young child, a child who tests her  patience. Swinton was able to bring real depth to her character. When  she does make the effort, the damage is already done. Throughout the  movie, Swinton plays a tragic and lonely figure who is isolated in some  form, a character who is a shell of her former self. 
Kevin is strongly played by two actors: Jasper Newell plays Kevin as a  little brat, pushing his mother with his behaviour and playing Eva and  his father (John C. Reilly) against each other. As a teenager, Erza  Miller portrays Kevin with a sociopathic and nihilist outlook. He has a  sharp mind, but enjoys inflicting pain on others, including his little  sister (wonderfully played by the young Ashley Gerasimovich). He is a  character who believes in nothing and takes a destructive path as a  sinister air is always around him. 
Reilly plays Franklin as a normal suburban dad, someone who wants to do  the right thing for his children. It was a wonderfully natural  performance of a man who just sees Kevin's behaviour as being typically  boyish. He is very deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod for such a  believable performance. 
There is a permanent, chilling sense throughout the film thanks  Ramsay's low key direction and the power of the performance. This is a  film that should stick in your head, but We Need to Talk About Kevin  should not have been so clear-cut.

'We need to talk about Kevin' is a tale of guilt, grief and shame of a mother (Tilda Swinton) whose son Kevin (Rock Duer, Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller) has committed an atrocious massacre at his school. Based on the acclaimed novel by Lionel Shriver (2003) and directed by Lyne Ramsey who has been missing from the movie horizon of recent years, a powerful and excellently constructed piece of cinema is upon us.

The storey encompasses the mothers' outlook on life before, during and after the event. The use of a non-linear time frame allows the film to be constructed in such a way that to those unfamiliar with the original text will be led in one direction of thought as to the characters progression only for the film to turn on its heels and lead you in another direction. 

The casting and acting is of paramount importance in a film where the primary relationship between two characters forms the basis of context for the others. Swinton offers an excellent drawn out, confused, guilt ridden mother whereas Ezra Miller as Kevin gives us an unflinching look into the abyss of a sociopath.

The casting of as the father John C. Reilly for me was the only flaw, simply due to his recognisable and somewhat comical appearance, which when compared to the subtlety and non-obtrusive nature of the remaining cast and extras stands out although his performance was strong.

Ramsey's use of symbolism and carefully inserted mise en scene gives those with a more discerning eye glimpses of the details of the emotional frailties evident in the novel but which are often so hard to convert when any literary text makes the transformation into the medium of film, we all know the saying 'the book was much better'. But here the both Lynne Ramsey and Roy Kinnear develop an excellent screen play that will satisfy both those who have read the book and those who have yet to. The sequencing of opening shots in most scenes allows a strong sense of atmosphere to develop even before the characters have entered the scene or dialogue has even commenced.

The overall impact of the film rides through peaks and troughs. With some sections brilliantly gripping and others making you wish away the remainder of the film. In general the film does carry a strong and unsettling momentum until the final credits. For those looking for an action soaked gore fest will be left waiting as will those looking for the docudrama styled film similar to Gus Van Sants' Elephant (2003). The film won't be for all or maybe even for that many, but those who enjoy carefully layered cinema creations will be drawn to this title like a moth to a flame and with good reason.

I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it, and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies, right? The subject sounded fascinating: parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story, and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that, properly told, should bring tears to any parent's eye.

Sadly this movie was a major disappointment.

It wasn't just bad. It was boring. The first half drags.

Writer/Director Lynne Ramsay has this annoying habit of jumping between different time-lines, but the jumps are unconnected. This is not just confusing, but she kept repeating the same scenes laboring the same points. It became tedious. I think Ramsay is trying to be arty, but art is supposed to convey feeling. Instead this was boring and incoherent.

After dragging through the first half the movie finally progresses, but never lives up to its title. The parents never do "talk about Kevin". Apart from checking his hearing as a toddler, they never seek medical or psychological help, or talk to a social worker. We never see a single teacher who, over ten years, you think might have noticed something. Relatives or friends who might comment on his behavior (and could provide a better narrative than Tilda merely looking stone-faced) are completely absent in this movie. Yes, despite Eva (Tilda's character) being a travel author and adventurer she somehow has no friends. And even when Kevin pours caustic soda in his sister's eye and sticks the family pet down the waste disposal unit the parents still don't seek help. No family is this stupid, particularly when the safety of another sibling is at stake.

Books that sell tend to have solid stories, so movies adapted from them don't have a problem with plot holes. Ramsay instead omitted many of the book's explanations and introduced the plot holes on her own accord:

She has the townspeople vilifying Eva to the point she can't walk down the street without being slapped. But Eva lost her husband and daughter too. I don't think an entire town would be that heartless. If everyone hates her and she is that miserable there, then why doesn't she just move? She goes from being a wealthy author in a huge house to living in a miserable shack with a menial job. Why? There is no explanation. I've assumed for this review that Kevin is a sociopath, but you wouldn't know from the movie because they never go anywhere near these subjects.

Ramsay appears to be squeamish or chose not to sensationalize the violence, because there is very little blood and almost no violence. Those scenes where something does happen are so heavily edited you might not even realize it. The school massacre at the end of the movie is so heavily edited it looks like Kevin is standing in an empty stadium shooting arrows into thin air. At the end she finally does show Kevin's father and sister dead, at which point I wondered why she edited the earlier violence to the point of incoherence. 

If you are making a movie about violence, then be prepared to show it. If for whatever reason you choose not to, then at least don't include the violent scenes with the violence cropped out of it. People either look, or they look away. If they look, they look at what is going on. By trying to do neither Ramsay's result simply ends up looking like bad camera-work; like a wildlife documentary not filming the lion but the patch of grass 30 feet to the right of them.

The book apparently gives a lot of background which Ramsay left out. In the book Eva resents baby Kevin for bringing an end to her adventurous lifestyle, but the movie only hints at this. (The truth is this happens to all parents, and we deal with it.) Likewise that baby Kevin's constant crying shows there something is wrong with him. (Again, this affects all parents. Again, we deal with it.) Why doesn't Eva ever talk to her mother, who is supposedly just a phone call away? These sort of errors make me wonder if Ramsay has any children of her own, or consulted parents when she was writing the movie.

Some have praised the acting, but I wouldn't. Tilda, usually a great actress, wears the same stone-faced expression. Ezra Miller looks mean and sneers, but it would be unfair to blame the actors because they are given nothing to work with. I'm not sure if John C. Reilly is necessarily miscast as Eva's husband, but there is no chemistry between Tilda and he.

Except for the minor role of Kevin's sister, the characters in this movie do so many stupid things it is impossible to empathize with them. 

This film is a missed opportunity. It had good source material, a great actress and an intriguing concept. Ramsay should have spent more time on the story and less time choosing out-of-place songs to play over Ms. Swinton's driving scenes.

This movie's fatal shortcoming isn't that it is bad, because even bad movies can be entertaining. It's problem is that it is boring. Special credit to film critic Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle who called this movie for the bore it is. Most other movie critics were taken in by it and praised it as art.

I love thrillers, psycho-thrillers, especially if there is originality and they can surprise me. This movie didn't in any way. The mix of present and past just makes the movie unbearable boring. There are no real surprises at all. After the first 20 minutes it was perfectly clear what would happen/has happened. Then the situations with mother and young Kevin are just ridiculous. I'm working with children (and have experience with more than "difficult" ones): I don't expect a movie to be authentic in any way, but Kevin's behaviour is just cliché, nothing more, there is no deeper personality, it's just black and white. Summing up the content, I would say: the movie has no point at all, there is absolutely no tension, the people harassing the mother after the killing: pure nonsense. None of the characters is more than one-dimensional, this movie doesn't work in any way. At least this is my opinion and I wouldn't have written a review, if there wasn't this incredibly high amount of stars, something I don't understand in any way. Yes and I know giving one star seems to be just an angry reaction, but that's not true, I would even give this movie zero or minus stars, if possible: Because in relation to the money spent on it, the usually pretty talented actors (in other movies) etc. wasted on this piece of crap - sorry, but I think, there is not a better fitting expression -, this movie is beyond any proportionality.

From the outset, the tone of the film is relentlessly depressing. The behaviour of Kevin as he progresses from toddler to teenager (kudos for the superbly similar-looking actors involved) is bad; he seems to hate his mum, love his dad, and unless you're living on another planet, you know he's going to turn into a Columbine high school type of assassin.

So what is there to appreciate? The endless flashback/flashforward mode of storytelling works well, because you know from the surroundings and from Tilda Swinton's demeanour, costume and house which stage of Kevin's development you're watching. The acting is fine, though I'm not convinced it takes all that much to play a whole film showing you're a malevolent devil-spawn (Kevin) or a long-suffering, endlessly patient mother (Swinton).

The big question is: why should this interest any viewer? Well, you could argue that you watch the whole development of the Kevin character, except that he's a pathological piece of garbage from his earliest moments in the pram. You could watch the evolution of the mother, except that Tilda Swinton doesn't evolve, she just puts on number 3 face for the whole movie so you feel the occasional sense of relief on the rare occasions she does number 2 and smiles a bit (face number 1 is reserved for other movies).

The end result is tedium or fascination, depending on your point of view. With apologies to all who tried so hard to make this a vivid, fascinating account of the psychological background to seriously dysfunctional teenagers, there's nothing in this film that is novel, revealing, gripping or inspirational. It's not a sleeper, but it's light years from anything that will make you want to watch it again 2 months, 2 years or 2 decades from now: and that's a pretty good criterion for judging whether to see a film or spend the time on better things.

After being advised by some friends that it was an excellent movie and had a basic knowledge about what it was about I thought I would really like this film and my oh my was I wrong. The beginning is so silent and confusing, your not sure whats really going on (the tomato scene??) Talk about drawing out the story. Don't get me wrong the acting in it is really good but thats about it. Its so drawn out and unclear as to whats happened, if I had my way I would have just turned it off halfway. It obvious the kid isn't normal but they don't actually show him doing anything really disturbing..the drain cleaner incident and missing guinea pig incidents are very unclear and don't even get me started on the fact that people in the town hate her...he also killed her daughter and child - how could anyone hate her? It makes no sense. Stupid, boring confusing drawn out film I wished I never watched it. Thank you and goodnight.

It was slow, incredibly boring and really strangely hysterical to watch Tilda just constantly staring catatonically into the camera lens - (so close you can see her pores) as he film maker aimlessly walks around backwards camera poised.. There's no connection to be found with the characters and it switches you off right from the start in the random tomato fight! What a joke.. Seriously not worth a minute in front of the screen..

What an awful waste of time Her shots were self indulgent The story was so frustrating to follow It made no sense None of this would have happened this way. Kids aren't born evil. No parent would let their kid get away with the things they did. The father would have picked up on the tendencies. Don't WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! AWFUL TERRIBLE NO GOOD DISGUSTING it Sucked. Tilda Swinton was decent but she was given very little to act. It was a bunch of concepts of what a lost helpless mother should look like. How about his teachers and other people who would have picked up on his sociopathic behavior. Don't waste your time with this crap movie. Overly wannabe artistic garbage, self indulgent BS!

Much of this movie version of Lionel Shriver's "We Need to Talk about Kevin" just doesn't live up to the impact of the novel. I found the first half boring, the stylized mini-flashbacks annoying. The music selections seemed inappropriate and odd, some too-loud country-western (?) stuff played over too many scenes of the mom driving. Lots of Tilda Swinton (mom) looking shell-shocked. Completely awful miscasting of that goofy-looking John C. Reilly as the dad, even if he did act his part well enough. The young actor who plays Kevin as a teenager is very handsome, with striking almond-shaped eyes, as if he had an Asian grandparent--he looks nothing like either of his ostensible parents. The second half picked up a bit, but they left out the scene where Kevin tells his dad what he really thinks of him, a significant breech. The end fell flatter than in the novel. Sadly disappointing.

CONTAINS SPOILERS: A tedious and drawn out misery-flick. It would have been a great picture (great subject matter and actors) but for trying to be all things at once. The father is so absurdly dim, insensitive and biased as to belong in a comedy sketch. The convoluted plot and mish mash of devices (the red paint, the random guy in a wheelchair, the tomato wrestling at the beginning, the dead father and daughter at the end, the obfuscation over how the daughter loses her eye) detract from the story progression and from the intense Swinton and the unsettling Ezra, who made the film worthwhile to sit through (I nearly walked out, that tedious was the first half).

From the first scene to the last, we're bombarded with what seems to be the hallucinating visions of the mother.

It's just flashes from one place to another, as if you're taking a tour inside that troubled mind(the mother's) but without a guide or pamphlet to tells you what's what.

That might work in a comedy, where the randomness can be fun to watch, but in a drama; about a school shooting no less, it just looks like the files the FBI collected after interviewing the mother, over a long period. Sooo dry, and boring.

Imagine if someone was telling the story of WWII by saying: Hitler committed suicide...Romania gave Hitler Oil...the Allied chose Normandy as a second choice...FDR used a wheelchair, etc. That's how this film was to me. 

In short, it lacks that interesting connecting thread that a good story should have.

IMPORTANT: i really wish that you read this before reading the IMDb synopsis!!

ALAS, the IMDb synopsis ruined the movie for me. i read it and i knew what is gonna happen in the first 10 minutes whereas it is revealed half an hour before the movie ends. 

i thought this is going to be another movie dealing with the same subject as the rabbit hole or the son's room. but it turned out to be a really different movie dealing with different subject. 

while watching it, there were echoes of the omen and another movie that you will know once you watch " We need to talk about Kevin" . 

it's a brilliant movie yet shocking and bleak. i loved the script and the directing. the acting was superb especially Tilda Swinton who seems capable of mastering the strong and deep emotions.

the surprise was the acting of the young Kevin- Jasper Newell- and it's really surprising that he had not been nominated for anything for his performance that leads the way to what's going on in the movie. 

it is a great movie and you should see it. one warning, chose the right time and mood to watch it.

"There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true."  Soren Kierkegaard

According to journalist Chris Hedges, "Those who cannot love are spiritually and emotionally dead. They affirm themselves through destruction, first of others, and then, finally, of themselves. Those incapable of love never live." This emotional deadness and inability to empathize with others is reflected in fifteen-year-old Kevin (Ezra Miller) in Lynne Ramsay's first film in nine years, We Need to Talk about Kevin, the chilling story of a sociopathic teenager who commits a horrendous crime (not explicitly shown), one for which his mother must endure the anger and resentment of the community.

Based on a novel by Lionel Shriver and co-written by Ramsay and Rory Stewart Kinnear, We Need to Talk about Kevin builds a fractured narrative told from the point of view of Kevin's mother Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton), a former big-city dweller who loved to travel and write books until she became a mother. Unfolding as if in a fevered dream and told in a stream of flashbacks and flash forwards, a now depressed and solitary Eva looks back at key emotional tripping points along her son's destructive journey.

At the outset, we are immersed in red, a frequent motif throughout the film. Here, we see a young Eva and other revelers bathed in a sea of tomatoes at a festival in Spain, which, in its orgy-like quality, is a hint of what is to come later. The scene then moves forward in time to a city intersection where the sound of a worker's drill creates a dissonant symphony with the unstoppable cries of Eva's infant son Kevin. Eva and her little boy (Rocky Duer, Jasper Newell) live in a well-to-do suburban house with husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) and little sister (Ashley Gerasimovich. These surroundings stand in sharp contrast to the box-like home in a run-down neighborhood where Eva is shown years later, a house spray-painted in red by outraged neighbors.

By the age of six, young Kevin has already become a master manipulator, refusing to speak and still wearing diapers. His deviously destructive behavior is directed towards his mother and he is skillful in knowing how to use it for maximum psychological effect. Though Eva takes him to a doctor, he simply reassures her that there is nothing physically wrong with Kevin, only that he may need more time to mature. No reason is provided for Kevin's behavior, but it is clear that Eva resents being a mother and this is made real by her apathetic self-pity. She tells him, "Before you were born, Mommy used to be happy!" Now Mommy wakes up every day and wishes she were in France!" Her frustration erupts when she throws Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm for his refusal to be toilet trained, not the best way to make an emotional connection.

She receives little support from her husband who refuses to believe that his son has severe emotional problems, but instead questions his wife's sanity. Instead of confronting the issues, Franklin ignores them, giving Kevin a toy bow-and-arrow set and later a high-powered bow, without any consideration of how they might be used. The father's lack of understanding prevents Kevin from being disciplined in the way that he should and there is no discussion of counseling with teachers or support groups, or professional therapy when it is obviously badly needed. Though the film's title is We Need to Talk about Kevin, apparently nobody thinks that that might be a good idea.

After the violence is committed, Eva has to cope with the contempt of her neighbors. She gets a job with a travel agency but is verbally berated by a co-worker (Alex Manette) at a company Christmas party. In an episode bordering on the surreal, Eva drives through a menacing crowd of Halloween trick or treaters to the background of Buddy Holly singing "Every Day." Mundane events such as walking down the street or shopping at a supermarket become fraught with danger. When two religious missionaries come to her door, she uses the opportunity to turn on herself, telling them that there is no point in talking because "I'm going straight to hell. Eternal damnation, the whole thing." 

While We Need to Talk about Kevin is an engaging and often gripping film that offers outstanding performances by Swinton and Miller, it is torn between being an exploitative horror film and a psychological family drama and ends up not being very successful at either. Marred by its inability to decide whether to blame ineffective parenting for Kevin's behavior or to blame the fact that he was just born "evil," the film takes no stand at all, apparently throwing up its hands and saying, sometimes "bad" things happen for no reason, a dubious premise.

While some may see the film as wisely left open to interpretation, the fact is that there is little to go on in drawing any conclusion. Ramsay never really probes either side of the question, surfboarding over the waves and not dealing authentically with character motivation or development. Though, to its credit, the film displays an unanticipated forgiveness towards Eva by a school victim confined to a wheelchair, in its totality, We Need to Talk about Kevin is more of a display of rage, hatred, and victimization than an attempt to provide new insight or have us see the characters as flawed human beings rather than as spawns of Satan.

They certainly did need to talk about Kevin. I'm fine with difficult subject matter and ambiguous storytelling. But this film just seemed lazy in its search for answers. Tilda Swinton plays a mother that is haunted by something in her past. Her son is in jail, the whole town hates her, and her husband is no longer around. No prizes for guessing what is going on here. She tries to live a normal life but the town just wont forget the past. She looks at her past to see how her son turned into such a monster. The film angered me by dong nothing of note. Swinton is a terrible mother, as she never seeks help for her son. I've seen kids misbehave, but this film takes it so far. It comes across as some cheap Hollywood horror film. There is no way a sane woman wouldn't reach out or get out. Even when her daughter's safety is put at risk, she does nothing. Then we have Reilly as the father. He believes nothing his wife says, which makes me question why they are married in the first place. Even when Kevin acts out in front of him he he does nothing. Swinton also lives in the worst town in the world. The people are so horrid, you'd probably want to massacre their offspring yourself. I understand the anger, but this entire town is filled with vicious human beings. I was able to connect with one character in this entire film, the boy in the wheelchair. Other than that, you have a film of unbelievable, stupid, and cruel people. The acting is great, and it's shot beautifully. I've already read up about the book which seems more cohesive, and the narrative obviously works better than it does in this film.

In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: 'It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:

Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the "incident". Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever job comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even to the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that solitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian (Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler), who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw, Franklin (John C. Reilly), Eva's complacent husband, just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.

Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration. For some this kind of non-linear story telling may be disconcerting, but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin - first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin 'Robin Hood' and his arrows, at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer. Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least, for this viewer, is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen.

This is a film with a tough premise especially in light of events over the past twenty years in the US and recently in Norway. The film lets it known that this is the central act of the film so there is nothing spoiled here. Difficult to watch but you will be kept entranced. 

Tilda Swinton gives a performance as a mother (Eva) with the most difficult son imaginable. She can't cope with the boy who seems to be as sharp as the adults. Nothing seems to be beyond him and he is always a step ahead. Eva is on her own as her loyal and loving husband doesn't understand or see the truth. This all culminates to mass tragedy. The film moves back and forth between the tragedy, after the tragedy, and mostly Kevin's upbringing as a toddler and then teenager. 

No CGI or anything required in this. It's quite a raw film, but the director uses lots of different scopes and shots to get us to feel unnerved as much as Eva has to endure. It's very well filmed and the acting from the central duo of Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller are brilliant. I can't think of a more frightening performance or character than Ezra's portrayal of "Kevin" for a long time. Terrific.

Word of warning, some might find it a little too unsettling. However, the film and book have never masked their subject and what you see is what you get. A dark and well adapted film which most will keep them glued to their seat.

This film is praised as an attempt to understand the development of a sociopath who ends up committing a high school massacre. In this respect it succeeds, mainly due to some good acting. But in other respects the film is disappointing: we found it pretentious, unconvincing and irritating.

First, there are too many scenes involving dubious eruptions of various red fluids, supposedly to depict the mother's guilt feelings about recent bloodshed. These took up about 1/4 of the film, starting with the long dream sequence at the start, and annoyingly recurring every 5 minutes in the first half of the film.

The opening dream sequence attempts some kind of surrealist street party vision. Unlike your average street party, everyone is swamped in a sea of tinned tomatoes. They revel ecstatically in the the gunge, especially the mother, who is finally carried Christ-like, through the seething mess.

Unfortunately this scene is unconvincing. The main emotion evoked is despair, about the shocking waste of tinned tomatoes. Subsequently the flow of the film is, far too frequently, interrupted by scenes of mother painstakingly cleaning up loads of red stuff on her car & house, as apparently dispatched by angry neighbours to make her feel even more guilty. Apart from the boring nature of these scenes, it seems rather pessimistic to assume neighbours would act in this way, since she was only the mother, not the killer.

Another mistake is that the ultimate deathly rampage around which the film is built, turns out to be fairly tame by American standards. Unlike well known cases, where the protagonist gains access to an arsenal of firearms, the film portrays a watered down version in which his only weapon is a bow and arrow. A better film would have acknowledged the problem of firearms, even if this was not the main theme. This "bow and arrow" plot line, leads to further problems, because the flow of the film in the final minutes is disrupted by questions about how a massacre could actually be accomplished with a bow and arrow. The final killing episode is confusing.

There are other poorly depicted scenes in which the viewer is left wondering about issues that are not really worth wondering about. Such as: Mother is inside the house on halloween. She is fearful of halloween troublemakers so we expect bricks to come through a window or something, but no, its eggs breaking on the fridge. So she left the windows open? No, the windows were shut... Who cares.

And another 10 minutes are wasted, wondering what happened to little sister's eye. There's a strong suggestion big brother did it, but we never know.
