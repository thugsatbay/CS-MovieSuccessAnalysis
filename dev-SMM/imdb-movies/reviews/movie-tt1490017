### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, "Are you kidding me?!" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.

Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.

The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and "master builder", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the "special" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for "the piece of resistance" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.

It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! 

The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as "(leading) lives of quite desperation." 

Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around "master builders" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built "according to the directions." This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.

The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.

The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.

A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. 

The voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy. 

The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's "resistance piece". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels.

Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our  childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the  unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little  resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved  so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap,  hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a  bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor  acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra). 
So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego  Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than  a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy  store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets  of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most  original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has  quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014. 
Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out  his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to  all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an  obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex  Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more  mustache-twirling insanity. 
A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads  Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of  only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their  impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him  before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius  (Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and  WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most  hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a  plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise  fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all   provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad  Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman. 
From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless  array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil  Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert  grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that  every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's  best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles,  and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules  established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen  must be possible to construct in the real world. 
There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act  that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily  derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect  execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount  of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego  Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a  brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great  foundation to build on. 
Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously,  The Lego Movie is fantastic.

I was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can say is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled.

"The Lego Movie" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely satisfying film for all ages- that is, if you have ever played with Legos. Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy this awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.

(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop singing the "Everything is awesome" song played in the movie. Too catchy!)

The creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about Legos and making a new movie packed with humor.

The voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed doing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic as the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this movie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business. He gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh, smile, and want more Lego awesomeness.

I give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best picture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all Lego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome, just like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film.

The Lego Movie is a winner on several levels. There is a good amount of clever gags and I was constantly bursting with laughter. I was surprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos, pop icons and film references, providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers. The playful approach towards movie clichés made it a really enjoyable and refreshing watch. The animation is absolutely stunning and the blend of CGI with stop motion worked brilliantly. Everything can be attachable, making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and unlike anything you've ever seen. The Lego Movie has plenty of heart too by the end of the journey and it's going to be really tough for another animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm.

I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out "chose one" clichés and also rather poignant and touching. 

The first thing one has to mention is the animation. Not only does it look like an amateur stop-motion film with a $500 million budget, but the amount of detail and creativity put into the visuals is just staggering. At times there's so much going on the screen it's almost overwhelming, yet if you look closely you can see that every single thing is comprised of recognizable Lego parts. The various ways the world shifts, breaks, is constructed again, falls apart and moves around is simply a joy to watch. The implementation of real-world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon "Kragle". The result is a film that looks unlike anything we've seen before.

The script is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious gag after another. The jokes come at you so fast you can't catch them all in one viewing, and blink-and-you'll-miss-it side gags clutter the screen. No running gag wears out its welcome, no joke is overplayed or overemphasised. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own. Batman especially is a riotous parody of the grim, dark versions of the Caped Crusader we've been stuck with for nearly a decade. And due to Lego having rights for nearly every IP imaginable, you won't be able to guess which mega-franchise is going to turn up next. 

Despite all this high praise, there are a couple of minor issues. During its third act the tone of the film starts moving to a more serious and emotional direction, which to me didn't work as well as the rapid fire comedy of the rest of the film. The voicework is great for the most part, but amidst all the others it becomes rather apparent that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are live, not voice actors. It's not that their performances are bad, they just seem rather flat and lifeless in comparison to the rest of the cast. 

The Lego movie is a downright masterpiece, there's no two ways about it. Incredible visuals and animation combined with a hilarious script, dazzling creativity and good characters make it one of the best and most original animated films in a long time. Some minor hindrances can do very little to drag it down, and the end result is fantastic.

This is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other IMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a mistake to see this movie because it's just a "toy" movie. But that's what makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters throughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character development.

Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris Pratt) who steals the show. 

It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming from beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less said, the better.

If you watch the trailer and you think its just gonna be a fun stop-motion animated Lego movie, you were wrong. The Lego Movie is beyond fun. its creative and it brings back a lot childhood memories. The story was amazing, the jokes were hilarious, and they have great intention in details.

But, the most important thing, the movie remind us to be creative. Because sometimes, As we grow up, in someway, we stop being creative and just follow the rules and instruction. For adults, this movie will bring back your childhood memories and how you used to play randomly with those Lego. And for a kids, you'll just love this movie, and definitely makes you want to play with your own Lego.

totally worth watching movie! even your grandparents will enjoy this movie! 9/10

To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it. 
The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders. 
Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities. 
The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.

Went to see it with my brother. With the age difference between us we both loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It's amazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and interact with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and even some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You'd be surprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. 

I think all people from all ages can find something in this movie that will warm their heart. A timeless classic for sure.

This film has great animation and a great story, it has an all star voice cast example Morgan freeman and will Ferrell. This film will be up on the shelve as one of the greatest films ever animated, ever thought about and ever written. When I was a kid playing with Lego I never thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they have all my Christmases have come at once. Cant wait for the special features on blue ray. This movie will be up there with toy story 1 2 and 3 , the lion king , frozen and wreck it Ralph.

I usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy Story being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me. There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the 'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children commented on this.

"The Lego Movie" is irritatingly frenetic, smug, and so ugly to look at it hurt my eyes. Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but borrowings of borrowings. "Jokes" come fast and furious. They come so fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not. Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few seconds of "Danny Boy." This is supposed to be funny because Liam Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the chute. 

There's something really smug and divorced from the audience about all this joking. I can just see the writers slapping themselves on the back, congratulating themselves, "Gosh, aren't we clever?"

Morgan Freeman, whom I used to like but who has become predictably ubiquitous in his unending God roles, plays the part of God, or close enough in this secular/Pagan/superhero super derivative mash-up. He tells Emmet (truth in Hebrew; not sure if there is any intended connection) that he, Emmet, is the Messiah. Only the film uses the word "Special." Same thing. Eventually the moral of the film is revealed: if you believe in yourself, you are the Messiah, the most intelligent, powerful, interesting person on the planet. Wow, that will make for healthy and happy kids. Not. Luckily the film is incoherent enough that many kids won't even realize that that is the film's message. 

In this heavy-handed movie, there's a heavy-handed, live action coda that breaks with all that has gone before. The message of the coda: suit-wearing, rules-following, heterosexual white American businessmen are the biggest menace to the planet, and we should all be more anarchic, creative and narcissistic. Wow, that's a message that Hollywood has never sent before. 

Nothing that happens in the action on screen matters. It's one long chase, with Lego characters turning themselves into whatever they want at will, and flying freely. Since they can do this  turn themselves into weapons or escape vehicles  it doesn't really seem to matter that they are occasionally captured by a character named "Bad Cop"  problems with authority much?  tortured, and threatened with genocide. Yes, really. There are torture scenes in a movie meant for preschoolers. I found the torture scenes hard to watch, not because they were moving, but because they were weird and out of place. I sat there thinking, what kind of mind puts torture scenes like this in a movie for little kids? 

I found the movie so ugly it was hard to look at. You are, after all, looking at computer-generated pieces of plastic. There is no sun, no light, no texture, no authentic color. Just  pieces of plastic. The perfect metaphor for this film.

I go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like it. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems like a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came home and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.

In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the action scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no interesting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of Batman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.

To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.

People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people can see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie already very overrated.

It was approaching the end of the year when I finally joined everyone else and enjoyed seeing the Lego Movie, a few seasons after it was released. Although I try not to pay attention to hype and critical response, it did seem like a positive that the same people sneering at Transformers for being a pumped-up toy commercial, were perfectly in love with the Lego Movie even though it is entirely reasonable to point out that it will do that product absolutely no harm to be literally the building blocks of a bright, colorful film where one of the messages is to be creative and mess around with things. The plot is quite light  a perfectly ordinary construction worker who spends his life following instructions and order, suddenly finds himself declared the Special One by a group called the Master Builders, who are racing to prevent Lord Business from destroying the world as they know it.

It is a bare bones plot but the flesh put onto it is actually pretty good. With access to a range of characters and franchises, the film has a lot of fun playing with the Lego brand but also the many other brands and characters that it can draw in; this produces a busy film with lots of opportunities for pop culture references and jokes  a lot of which it takes. This is accompanied by lots of frantic action, which is well animated but perhaps just too busy to be fun all the time (often I struggled to really see what was happening amid all the rapid colorful movement  again the type of comment thrown at Transformers but less-so at this). All of this makes it entertaining and the novelty of the Lego is well used to add to the comedy.

Towards the end there is a nice development which I thought was pretty clever and well done; it also opens the door to bring heart into the film by virtue of making it more than cat poster messages and snappy one-liners. It has a reasonable try at this but it was a case of leaving it too late, and it hadn't manage to get this aspect to work through the film in the way that it really needed to have done to sell it totally. Still liked it for trying, but it is an extra at the end, not part of the overall being of the film. This feeling of it being very about the moment, slick and polished is ironically not helped by reading the cast list, since it is a great list of names all sharing the time. The positive of this is that off the page, they are all very good in the film itself, even if many of them are basically doing what we know they can/will do. So Pratt is fun and personable but basically is just doing Andy as a Lego figure. Ferrell, Neeson, Banks, Arnett and others are all good while I enjoyed the many smaller turns ranging from Day and Hill through to Daniels and Billy Dee Williams.

All told it is lively fun, with plenty of crafted dialogue and delivery, but it is the area of heart where it doesn't totally hit home; leaving it entertaining but perhaps not quite worthy of the hype.

A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.

Never since TOY STORY 3, I had so much fun in an animated film. Also, this film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a kid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this film, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the film itself.

The film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a hero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film that has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the writing, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out loud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle. 

The animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D film with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the animation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of animation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful for the cinema world over. 

The music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed "everything is awesome". Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the animation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the 3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too. 

I am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters with more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the kid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids.

One of many done in good crop of animations that cinema is providing increasingly more often. A definitive example of smart and edgy script, which can enjoy brilliantly the legacy of one of the most popular toys of all time. 

A universe that seems to come from a psychedelic hallucination in breakneck pace, is narrated the journey of Emmet, the most common Lego character, that quiet life amidst the building blocks, will become a true hero. 

Masterfully using the resources of dystopian fiction plus lots of humor, and a visual that never fails to impress, "The LEGO Movie" is tailor- made for generations accustomed to the pace of video games, that with quite a collection of characters charismatic , a ton of colors and creativity, will deliciously take you until the surprising and affectionate outcome that celebrates the power of childish imagination.

If you want either a primer into the experience of having ADHD or an endless advertisement for Lego toys, then this unmitigated piece of rubbish is for you.

From the opening onwards it is a series of visual and audio assaults on the viewer, with one demolition scene after another. It all felt the same after about fifteen minutes. Boringly the same.

Lots of reviewers have commented that it was very funny, but whatever humour was in it bypassed me. I barely smiled at anything in it. And I'm not normally the curmudgeon in the crowd.

Perhaps the nadir came when the human characters were introduced. Just in case we didn't quite get the heavy-handed messaging, we needed real humans to show us what it really looks like. And the message was simply philosophical romanticism married to pop psychology. Pleeeeaaaase can children be fed with something more helpful, if they have to be given these "moral lessons." If this movie was meant to recapture the pleasure of playing with Lego as a child, it didn't do it for me.

Three out of ten only because I've got to leave room for other even more dreadful flicks. One of which is most likely going to be Lego Movie 2 scheduled for 2018. Ugghhh...

I'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing all the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with the film...

-The pacing in this film was very off putting for me. Frenetic start! Character development was weak and things happened very fast for the first 15-20 minutes. It sort of made my head hurt. Then things slowed way down and I found the movie to be pretty boring right until the end.

-The plot line, where a father is taking away his kids legos, kind of irked me and it was obvious from the start he was going to come around by the end of the movie. As a Dad, I also thought it had the potential to undermine my authority with my kid a little. 

-The punch lines just weren't that funny. I chuckled a few times but that was it, and all the best jokes were already in the trailers. 

-Too much product placement. Lets be honest, the entire move is big ad for Lego. But then they throw in all the other products, and it really made the whole film feel like a giant "get your parents to buy this!" commercial to kids. 

So, there it is. My opinion on a very highly rated film that I just didn't enjoy very much.

The Lego movie may not seem like your cup of tea and perhaps you have instantly disregarded it as suitable for children alone, but I urge you to watch this film at your earliest convenience and see if you too do not become enraptured by this world of LEGO mini figures; and if the end credits appear before you have even uttered a squeak of delighted laughter, then I apologise for the misery that must be your life. Because if the LEGO movie doesn't make you chuckle at least once in the hundred minutes of on screen time then I cannot say I know what will. 

The fresh faced witty humour of the characters was refreshing and led to shrieks of amusement from the prepubescent's that filled the cinema and the belly laughed guffaws of parents alike. Unlike many children's films to date, the film featured none of the thinly veiled innuendos and stereotypes (commonplace in Disney films). Deviating from the norm, the 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and unprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main lessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to be someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do so. Instead of portraying heroism as something designed for the 'elite' and privileged few who have been 'destined' for greatness since birth, the recurring theme within the movie is that anyone can be a hero.

In the Lego Movie, and evil minifig named Lord Business has decided that he is tired of all of the creative people messing around with his stuff. He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The masterbuilders can only count on the "Special," a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.

The Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or capitalist system, in order to "expose" it.

In the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain is "Lord Business." After all, there are barely any better capitalist ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.

Nonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a boring infomercial for Legos.

The problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the way to the bank.

Just watched The Lego Movie last night...wow...I haven't laughed this hard OUT LOUD at a movie in so long! As a Lego fan growing up, I was eager to see it after the great reviews, and it surely didn't disappoint. All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from Batman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away the plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a message everyone can relate to. I enjoyed the ending, although when it came I was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half. This movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail, the humor, and the funny story. A definite 10.

my god this movie is amazing, and surprisingly pretty darn good. the animation is spectacular, acting is great. I forgot the premise though. it's funny, creative, and enjoyable for any age I'm 19 and I like this film. great cast, its just a lot of fun. bring your friends, family and see for yourself. this movie reminds me of when I was a kid playing with Legos with my brother and having a blast. this movie is so great I think it should get at least one Oscar if not already. no wonder why the ratings on this site was great. I like the cast its a great one especially for a kids movie I guess what you might call it. would I buy this film yes. I saw it with my dad and him and I were laughing and enjoying every part of it. go check this out because its one of those movie you cant miss.

Started watching without any expectations at all. 

What an incredible experience it was. The whole film balances really well between drama, action movie and a hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Ending had an unusual twist and added depth to the storyline. More over, this is a story from which almost everyone could learn something new. 

I really loved the way the heroes were chosen - it was like a bubbling mixture of superheroes, magicians and well-known cartoon heroes in general. 

Again this is a reminder that we can be much more than society tells us to be. This movie should be definitely watched on big screen because of many little details. Definite must see!

Cute movie. That's about it. A few, funny references and jokes. It's not at all an 8/10. I rented it from Redbox for $1.20 and it was well worth that price. I will write more lines because IMDb insists on a minimum content. Not sure why. My opinions about the movie were easily expressed in the first, two sentences. I will simply fill in wasted words and a waste of my time because this site has become so full of itself. Used to be a genuine place to investigate and review movies. Now, we have to log in, verify ourselves as ourselves and type encrypted words to be "accepted". Seems to me that Hollywood doesn't really want "every man's" opinions. They are happy to stay within their own world.
