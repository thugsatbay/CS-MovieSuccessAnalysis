### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Just saw this at an advanced screening in Long Beach and I must say the Jackass crew is back. This movie is exactly what I was expecting it to be. My friends and I debated whether or not the guys were too old but apparently they were offered enough money to not care much. This is just like Jackass Number 2 in that they got a big budget to do the set piece stunts. There is still the low key, sneak up on people pranks, but now in glorious slow motion.

The set piece stunts are in bright and crisp 3D that really adds to the effect of whatever they are trying to do. As others have stated the intro is pretty cool but I was actually left wanting just a bit more. Note the paintballs though, in amazing 3D. This is Johnny, Ryan Dunn, Steve-o, Pontius, and Weeman's show. Dave and Aaron end up getting hurt as usual but are awesome sports.

There are more gross out and insane, painful stunts than pranks on unwitting public people, but a few of the funniest skits fall into the latter category. The midget couple at the bar is the funniest in the movie by far. 

These guys are as funny as always and their genuine friendship is really quite nostalgic at the end. Its been nearly 10 years since Jackass went off the air and these guys are really still at the top of their game. The entire theater was crying with laughter the entire film. I was invited to stay after for a post film discussion and one of the other people summed it up nicely by saying he felt that not a single skit was a misfire. Matt Hoffman, Jeff Tremaine, and Spike Jonze were in the crowd.

Of the 25 or so people that stayed after the film, 22 thought it was the best of the trilogy.

Jackass 3D has intentionally done something I did not expect it to do. It purposely tugs at your heart if you have been watching the show since it's original inception in 2000. Seeing these guys at their age now and how well their chemistry is evoked on the screen makes you long for the early 2000's so this crew can always be around.

The purpose to see this film is to be grossed out of your mind right? Well rest assured you will laugh hard and be extremely grossed out. The film flows with a great pace just as the predecessors did.

As I said before, if you are a huge fan of the show, like I am, the closing credits of the film unexpectedly tugs at your emotions. It really is nostalgic to see this cast at their current age. Though they are all still in good physical shape, you can't help but wonder how much longer their bodies can handle the abuse.

Heres to more good times.

How does one review "Jackass 3D"? The tertiary installment in MTV's prank and stunt franchise is basically immune to criticism because you get exactly what you pay for. Love it or hate it, "Jackass 3D" accomplishes just about everything it sets out to; in effect, Johnny Knoxville scores a goal on an empty net.

I am the anomaly, but I'd wager next to no one is 'on the fence' about whether or not they should see this film. They either contributed to the massive $50 million opening weekend box office cume, or they immediately dismissed it. In my case, however, having never seen the "Jackass" films wasn't a conscious snub. Believe it or not, there just always seemed to be something better to watch.

But mine's not a high horse. I sought out and watched "Jackass" and "Jackass: Number Two" the week prior to my first theater experience with the series, and I'm glad I did. After all, I grew up on "America's Funniest Home Videos" and throughout high school religiously followed the English hidden camera show "Trigger Happy TV." "Jackass" is not as clever as the latter, but by measure of unbridled chutzpah, Knoxville and Co. are the reigning kings.

Like a Victorian freak show or museum of oddities, the often self-destructive experiments of the "Jackass" crew are the guilty pleasures of our generation. There's something almost gladiatorial about watching the elaborate dangers these brave idiots subject themselves to. Man vs. bull, man vs. mule, man vs. manour fascination with competition, spectacle, and injury is nothing new.

"Jackass 3D" being my first chance to observe others' response to these shenanigans, I was most amazed by the two-pronged reaction the audience had to the physical trauma the performers sustained. A given stunt would be executed, typically resulting in its participant doubling over in pain. The crowd laughed, as they'd been cued to. The film would then play back the moment in slow motion and suddenly everyone would groan or sharply inhale. Though we paid to laugh at people injuring themselves, what's more interesting is our ability to empathize with the depiction of human pain. That the "Jackass" films achieve both is not an insignificant feat.

This isn't the definitive "Jackass" experience, however. Having watched all three films in the span of a single week, I did discern a distinct arc that left me somewhat letdown with Knoxville's most recent effort. "Jackass: Number Two" improved upon the original with a more polished, professional look, and more elaborate and inventive stunts. It gave the genuine impression that the crew was pushing its boundaries and trumping itself wherever possible. That same sense of pioneering is largely missing from "Jackass 3D." The glasses- gimmick seems to supplant genuine innovation in their routine, and on the whole it feels slapdash in comparison to the conceptual genius of its prequel.

But what survives in "Jackass 3D," and what ultimately endeared me to the franchise is its creativity. Where it won me over was not in the painful payoff of each trick, but rather in the setup. The use of the camera to disorient, spotlight, and surprise is what really makes the series sing, and the trilogy is full of epiphanic moments of hilarity. "Jackass" has and always will be a potpourri of comedic elements, not all of which directly appeal to my specific sensibilities, but the variety is essential and the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.

I only wish "Jackass 3D" had more of the entrepreneurial spirit that so distinguished the second film. It may not be ambitious, but hey, a goal made on an empty net still counts.

In 1928, Charlie Chaplin wowed audiences by appearing on screen with a real, live lion for his celebrated film The Circus. A lion! Real! On screen! Audiences were mesmerized by this fascinating new art of cinema, an art made all the more engaging for the fact that the plastics of its image had roots in reality; that somewhere else in space and time, Chaplin had actually stood next to this lion and the reality of this image was now available to them for their own viewing pleasure.

For a contemporary equivalent, I give you Steve-O launched through the stratosphere in a PortaPotty full of dog poop. In 3D.

Jackass 3D appeals to cinema's time-honored capacity for ontological testament, and makes an equally compelling case for the camera's potency as an empathy machine: We see the setup of a stunt, we endure its execution, and we then either clutch our balls or puke in our mouths, depending on what the stunt entails. Cinema is reality, and their pain is ours.

Jackass isn't simply effective in the art of its performers, however, as there is a genius to the framing and editing of each segment as well. Many of the film's laughs are built in to its premises, and the crew smartly eschews over-explanation. We see a tee ball, we see the path this ball is on track to take, and we see Steve-O's nuts--as an intelligent and discerning audience, it is left to us to piece together the narrative before it unfolds, resulting in our increased engagement and a far greater potential for humor upon realization. And we then hang in that moment of anticipation, until the situation's potential energy is quickly and cathartically rendered kinetic.

Jackass 3D is notable as well for its use of stereoscopic 3D cinematography. In one scene, Johnny Knoxville fires a projectile toward the screen in slow motion to great effect: shallow depth of field slowly reveals this item to be a dildo, and 3D reveals the dildo to be humorously close to your face. Elsewhere, stereoscopy is employed in the service of some truly excellent model work; the scene's genuine beauty makes its ultimate subversion all the more effective.

Needless to say, Jackass 3D will not appeal to everyone. But as the film so effectively marries the ontology of outrageous stupidity to so many facets of cinematic expression, it's definitely worth seeing if you think you can stomach it. TK 10/17/10

First of all, if you don't know about Jackass, you need to be prepared for a movie with no point at all. Jackass is the third movie installment based on the popular MTV series with the same name that ran from 2000 to 2002. The cast includes Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn, Jason "Wee-Man" Acuña, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Ehren McGhehey. Therefore, even though the show was only on TV for three seasons summing to 25 episodes, the antics did not end there. In 2002, Jackass: The Movie was released, followed by Jackass: Number Two in 2006 along with numerous TV shows created by different cast members including Viva La Bam, Dr. Steve-O, Wildboyz, and Homewrecker. Four years after their last meeting in their second film these crazy men are back together in the latest Jackass movie in 3D! The film follows these characters as they beat the living hell out of each other while performing a series of hilarious, disgusting, disturbing and dangerous pranks. 

This is the first film that has used 3D in a way that makes the film worth seeing in 3D. The implementation of 3D adds to the party and along with another dimension to the film. It allows all of the pranks to be bigger, better, funnier and more entertaining by immersing the audience into the world of Jackass. The opening and closing scenes of the film abuse the use of 3D especially well through slow motion effects and exceptional cinematography (yes I did just say that). The stunts in the film are at a whole new level that the TV series or the previous films have not been able to capture. The stunts are so crazy and ridiculous in the film that they will leave the entire audience wondering; How are they all still alive? While no sane human being would be attempting these stunts in the first place leading to the fact that all of the actors mentioned earlier and especially Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Wee-man and Steve-O are all one of a kind maniacs that prove that they are four of the craziest and most entertaining men in the world (or are they just stupid?).

There is no plot at all to this film and contains a specific type of humor that isn't for everyone. There are a lot of sexually oriented pranks in some shape or form. The film targets a very small audience that includes males ages 18 to 35 and even in this demographic the movie isn't for everyone. The film is extremely disgusting to the point where multiple scenes are unwatchable to the extent of gagging. Nothing is off limits in the film and therefore there is no limit to how gross the film gets and no limit on how long the scenes last. The disgusting aspect of the film ranges from scenes with male nudity to other scenes with different forms of bodily waste. Jackass has always been this way and when it comes to male nudity there is significantly less nudity in this film than in Jackass: Number Two, which was more of a male nudity fest. Just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into before seeing this film.

The Jackass TV series and Jackass 3D in general takes an acquired taste and the right mood to enjoy. I cannot recommend this film because you already know if you want to see it or not. Therefore, I recommend that if you want to see it on the big screen in 3D see it now, otherwise, don't see it if you think its going

Jackass 3D is the latest from the group and as the title suggests, it's in 3D. Stunning 3D if I dare say so. No matter how old I get I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching these brave men launch various objects at their genitalia and ignite a wide variety of explosives while standing far too close for comfort.

I'm sure most of you have seen the trailer so I don't have to go into the stunts and pranks performed in the film, but what I will talk about is how amazing the film looks. 3D has been reserved for large scale action films and animated features. Here is essentially a documentary being shot in 3D, the first of its kind (though Werner Herzog's upcoming documentary Caves utilizes 3D technology as well).

The compositions on screen are so bizarre yet so simple. They make the most immature acts a work of art. Rather than finding out the harmful effects of being stunned by a stun gun or cattle prod, they turn it into an event whereby several members of the group run through a hallways with various types of these devices hanging in the air.

These daredevils or "trained professionals," as they disclaim in opening credits, have gone from punk rebels to cultural icons. Their outlandish pranks and inconceivable stunts are a testament to our society's consumption of the obscene and the absurd. We watch these hooligans abuse themselves for our enjoyment. We laugh at their pain. The only reason we laugh is because we aren't the ones feeling their pain.

What really makes this film funny is the groups approach to their work. I can imagine how many takes of each segment introduction their must be. The men are either dying from laughter at what is about to unfold, or they can hardly keep their composure for fear that this next stunt will be their last. Regardless, we get a sense that what we are seeing on camera is what these people are really like. They laugh, scream, and gasp for air like we would, though perhaps with a little more courage.

This carefree approach comes through in the production as well. The melding of the crew with the cast is like watching a dysfunctional family's home videos. The cameras capture the action both with the cast and behind the scenes with the crew. It's a fun, slightly off atmosphere. To help create this atmosphere, we are fortunate enough to listen to a great selection of songs, my favorite being Roger Miller's "You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd," played over Johnny Knoxville being chased after by a herd of buffalo. Oh yeah, he's also wearing roller skates. How fitting.

I don't think I need to tell you all this, but this film isn't for everyone. I can think of several scenes which some will find offensive, others will find revolting, and maybe a few of you will deem as unfit for human eyes. Still, those who are fans of the show or if you're looking for something new, look no further. This film is a raunchy, laugh riot.

Let's face it, you know what you're getting into when you walk into a Jackass movie. You're going to get nutshots, potty humor, vomiting and "interaction" with other bodily fluids. There is plenty of this in Jackass 3D. 

What you don't expect to get is forced laughter, fake set-ups and really, really BAD acting. I get why they laugh at the stunts. It's marketing. The harder they laugh, the harder you laugh. It's easier to laugh at something that someone is already laughing at. But the laughter is just too loud, too forced and goes on WAY too long for the "severity" of some of the stunts. The vignette with the *fake* -- and I MEAN FAKE -- gorilla in the idiot parents' hotel room was just beyond the pale. The "mom" has the worst fake reaction of anybody I've ever seen in Jackass. She is so unbelievable that she ruins the whole "gag." And then, supposedly, the "father" had the sh!t scared out of him -- literally. Give me a break. You will find yourself laughing at the stupidity of their reactions. You might also feel a little insulted that they think you're so stupid. It's also obvious that some of the people in the "street" gags are acting. They're just not good enough to pull it off. People know what natural reactions look like, and this just ain't it, people. 

There's also a scene where Johnny Knoxville (or Steve-O, I can't tell which) drives a scooter through a plate glass window. Just coincidentally, there is gas in the scooter INSIDE the dealership (never happens; big no-no), the path to the window was completely clear even though every single inch of the other windows in the dealership were cluttered with product, AND he goes through the 10-foot plate-glass window without being cut to shreds. Not even a scratch. C'mon, people.

Don't get me wrong; there are some big laughs in this movie. Big hits, big injuries and BIG falls. But I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. Thank GOD my movie wasn't in 3D or that taste could have been something else.

I really liked the last Jackass movie, because there was an intelligence at work there, beyond just a desire to be shocking and gross (though "shocking" and "gross" is being too mild). And this was just a lot more of the same.

The film is not for the squeamish, especially due to the delight taken in excrement. Excrement here is treated like confetti on New Years Eve. I don't want to get into details, because much of my enjoyment of this film is due to the shock factor. There were a few scenes that I was just too scared to watch.

I won't get into trying to describe or give a list of what's shown here. Let me just say that if Thomas Edison had ever thought his invention would show something like THIS, he'd have destroyed his camera and killed himself. But for about 80% of this film, I was howling with laughter, though terribly embarrassed I was carrying on like that.

The only thing I can say specific to a scene in this movie is that the Midget Bar Fight has got to be, no doubt about it, the most hilarious "Candid" scene I've ever watched.

I had major qualms about going to see a film so crude, gross, violent, and obviously marketed to an audience about 40 years younger. I saw it. I loved it. I'm so embarrassed. And I saw it in 2-D. Which was at least one D more than I needed. The idea of watching some of these scenes in 3-D . . .

First of all, if you are not a Jackass fan, then this film is not for you. It is full of crude and disgusting stunts, profanity, and shots of male genitalia. If that's not for you, then you won't like it. I, for one, happen to be a Jackass fan. Over the years of watching these guys beat themselves up for money, it almost feels like they became my friends. So, Jackass 3D was like a reunion. Hanging out with old friends in 3D. (The 3D definitely sold the film.) It starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, and I didn't want it to end. A worthy installment in the Jackass series, and the most fun at a film this year. Sheer stupid fun. So, if you like watching nut-shots and "poo cocktail supreme's," then definitely check out Jackass 3D in theaters. See it with friends. And see it in 3D.

"Jackass" isn't a movie that you can review by conventional standards.  Heck, it even isn't a movie in the strictest sense of the word; rather,  it's a feature-length version of the stunt and prank show that debuted  originally on MTV and has since found its way onto the big screen.  Three times I might add, with director Jeff Tremaine and the rest of  the Jackass cast proclaiming with each movie that it would be their  last. Tough luck they will have retiring- if you haven't already heard,  the movie smashed the fall opening weekend record when it debuted in  the United States. Clearly their steadily growing fanbase keeps  clamouring for more. 
If you, like this reviewer, haven't actually watched any of the  Jackass-es at work (or play, really) before this movie, then it's  better you take this example as a litmus test of just how much you'd  enjoy "Jackass 3D". In one of the stunts proudly named the "Poo  Cocktail Supreme", Jackass regular Steve-O is strapped in a sitting  position inside one of those mobile toilets filled with excrement. The  Porta-Potty is in fact bungee-corded between two cranes and on the  mark, is set flying upwards where it subsequently bounces up and down.  I'd rather not describe what happens inside the cubicle- suffice to say  that it is as hideous as you would imagine, perhaps even much more so. 
How much you are willing to stomach such scatological humour and  revolting gags really determines how much you are going to enjoy this.  There isn't a plot, there isn't a purpose, there isn't any continuity.  Basically, this is no more (and no less) than a countless string of  stunts, pranks and skits featuring leader Johnny Knoxville (who  introduces himself at the beginning of each segment) and his band of  merry idiots. You're better off looking for some maturity amongst a  herd of cows than amongst this group of overgrown mischievous buffoons. 
Not to say that there's nothing to admire about their buffoonery. One  can't help but be impressed by their willingness to sacrifice for their  art, even if the art is clearly made for the lowest denominator. Who  would readily put themselves in front of an oncoming ram or a few  buffalo? Who would readily place his genitalia in harm's way by tying  it to a flying toy helicopter (the stunt is called Helicockter, I kid  you not)? And who would dare drink another's sweat collected in a cup  while exercising on the treadmill wearing plastic wrap? You're not  likely to find people as ready or game as Knoxville, Margera, Ryan  Dunn, Steve-O, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Chris Pontius, Danger Ehren and  Dave England. 
You're also not likely to find the same kind of camaraderie elsewhere.  Whenever one of their stunts goes awry, or one of them bends over in  agony, the rest standing around will almost immediately huddle around  him, offering words of encouragement the way frat-boys would. None of  them would be here without the other- indeed, there wouldn't be a  Jackass without the fun and derring-do of each one of them- and it's  heartening to see the Jackass team displaying a keen sense of  friendship and solidarity. 
As with any circus act, not all the parts are equally interesting- e.g.  the one where Margera's parents get ambushed by a guy dressed up in a  gorilla suit when they check into a hotel room, or the rather  repetitive Evil Knievel-type stunts on jet skis and mini bikes. But  there is really more than enough to keep appreciative audiences  thoroughly entertained, e.g. the Lamborghini Tooth Pull, the Beehive  Tetherball and the Tee Ball, each one of which are self-explanatory by  their titles. 
And what of the extra dimension? Well let's just say that in the same  way that "Avatar" was made for 3D, the same way that dance movies were  made for 3D, and the same way that horror movies were made for 3D,  "Jackass" is one type of entertainment that was made for 3D. Indeed,  when a prosthetic sex toy flies in slo-mo through several different  iconic landmarks and finally shatters a glass of milk, the joy of  seeing it in the additional dimension is enough to convince you that  "Jackass" was meant for 3D.

A giant 3D penis flying at your face, a man lying under a model train track defecating in volcanic fashion and a midget fight in a bar it can only mean one thing, Jackass is back.

Johnny Knoxville and his merry pranksters returned to the big screen this week, its been 10 years since they made there first appearance on MTV and what a roller-coaster ride its been, ten years and three films later the franchise looks like its going out with a bang.

The ageing stars of the film still manage to put themselves through immeasurable torture for our amusement and still 10 years on manage to create new and original ways of making each other wince in agony.

The duck shooting and the Santa up the Christmas tree were perfect examples that the crew are not running out of ideas.

One thing Jackass has always managed to succeed at is offending and it does a damn good job in this instalment as well, with an old man groping his granddaughter in the middle of the street being a prime example, even my friends, 18 year old lads were questioning the morality behind it.

An element which is brilliant about this film however is the fact that if you don't like a gag, you only wait for a few minutes for the next one.

Obviously the movie is not going to be everybody's taste, with no doubt health and safety Nazis among other's crying in protest over its unsafe and distasteful nature, but let them carry on, because no-ones going to take away the fun from this flick.

If you have never seen Jackass before, let me enlighten you. Take a group of men of enduringly puerile persuasion, all of whom are old enough to know better, and set them to inflict mayhem on themselves and each other in a series of what Jackass itself refers to as "stunts" but which are a mixture of pranks, practical jokes, assaults, and elaborate mechanisms for causing pain and possible - probably, even - injury. Factor in a preoccupation with bodily functions and genitalia and voila - Jackass. Oh, and a key element is that after each episode of revolting, dangerous, disgusting mayhem which leaves one of the group damaged, in pain, humiliated (or all three) the rest of the group collapse in helpless laughter.

You know those party favours which squeak and extend when you blow into them? The 3D in Jackass 3D is used in order to have one of those extending to the camera lens. By virtue of someone expelling flatulence into the other end. And this is one of the more sophisticated episodes. Most are hardly repeatable in a public forum, and those that are repeatable involve things like mistreating midgets.

There is no story. No plot. No scripted dialogue (what dialogue there is is coarse). No subtlety. If you are easily disgusted you're going to hate it. If you're not easily disgusted you are still going to wince and want to look away quite often.

But, dear me, at its best it is very funny indeed. I laughed a lot, and felt ashamed every time I did.

Reviewing a film like Jackass 3D is harder than it looks even though this is the third installment in the film franchise, which came after a TV series that lasted for three seasons. Nearly everyone can recognize the franchise by name yet the people involved aren't actually actors (everyone is listed "as himself" in the credits) and a coherent story is nonexistent. With Jackass, you know what you're getting up front; a bunch of guys doing nothing but the most stupid and idiotic things for an hour and a half that usually involve their own genitalia or feces or both. You either think it's hilarious or downright hate it and judging by the packed theater a few nights ago, there's still a craving for Jackass.

Jackass 3D utilizes the 3D effect very well. That credit can go to the film actually being shot in the format rather than it being shot conventionally and converted to 3D later on. The opening and closing of the film are the best 3D examples; all of the explosions, paintballs, dildos, and God-knows-what flying at your face. As inane as it was, it was still nice to see the effect put to good use rather than just tacked on to make an extra $3 a ticket.

The more ridiculous and senseless stunts in Jackass have always drawn more interest on my end in comparison to the more crude bits involving bodily fluids. While Jackass 3D does have the honor of not only being the only film but the only film presented in 3D that features a bungee outhouse and a man drinking the sweat of another man, it's things like Electric Avenue (which features stun guns attached to strings and a spinning cattle prod), Bam's version of the Rocky films, and the Wee Man segment in the bar that features other midgets that are the real high points of the film.

Jackass 3D is exactly what you're expecting, but there's something about it that's intriguing. Once you start watching, you can't look away. You have to see how far this imbecility will go. Never has the phrase, "like watching a train wreck in slow motion," fit so well. While the film is certainly far from brilliant, there's a bit more creativity to it than what most give it credit for. Creative, shocking, and filled with more puke than you can shake a stick at, Jackass 3D is able to utilize 3D in ways that haven't been seen before while providing a few laughs and grossing you out all at the same time.

Let's face it, the fact you're even considering to watch this movie is because you want to see one thing. A bunch of dudes basically hurting each other in creative ways! And Jackass 3D comes back to hit the ball out of the park for a third time.

It's everything you'd expect, stupid, rude, disgusting and just plain dangerous, and it does it FLAWLESSLY! This is the brilliance that is Jackass. It's a film you're not sure about before you put it on. You'll know whether you'll like this or not which is why if you ask someone what they think of Jackass they'll either give you a 0 or a 10!

The film keeps the stunts fresh too! Full of new material all hilarious pranks so don't worry if you're thinking you'll find "Jackass...again....oh yeah we got 3D too". Speaking of which, the 3D isn't great or even necessary to watch but it's much better than most of the films with 3D so it does it's job.

Overall, this film is brilliantly vile. It should be sent to hell, just save me a seat down there and I'll bring the popcorn.

Jackass is childish . Jackass is stupid . Jackass is sick . Jackass is right up my street!

In this latest instalment Johnny Knoxville and the boys go all three dimensional on our arse and although i only saw this in glorious 2 D it still looked amazing.

The contents are much the same as what we're used to. This time we are exposed to stunts such as " Super Mighty Glue" where Wee Man & Preston are super glued together. . "The High Five" , where a giant hand springs out and hits people unexpectedly and " The helicockter" well , Use your imagination on that one!. 

My only disappointment is that i didn't get to see this in 3D as i think it might have looked great.

I'm not sure how much longer these guys can keep doing these stunts because sooner rather than later someone is going to get seriously hurt or failing that they will get too old but while they can i will still enjoy watching them.

Title said it all, never stopped laughing.

Definitely a mature movie, includes penises, tons of poop, and tons of ass....oh and dildo's. The poop, as others said was kind of a bit much in certain parts though.

The 3D wasn't a gimmick, it actually showed depth like another user said and gave life to the movie, especially the ending. I like how we also got to know each of the people int he movie and it was actually kind of heartfelt.

By far the most funniest thing was the billy goat or whatever, movie was non stop funny and would definitely see it again or even buy it.

Johnny Knoxville and the gang return for a 3D installment. I personally didn't see it in 3D. I'm sure the flying dildo looks great coming directly at the audience. The best prank is the first one, High Five. It's fun. I love the surprise to its victims. It's a great way to start. The part with the jet plane exhaust seems fun. It's something I want to do. Then there comes the most disturbing model train set. I'm sure Jackass fans would find it hilarious. I found it revolting. I could almost smell it. It's stomach turning. It follows it up with a rather silly dwarf fight. It's not until Electric Avenue before I recovered and that's mostly for the song. This is a lot of the same stuff from the gang. If you're a fan, you'll like what you get.

My brother persuaded me to watch this when he was visiting. I'm not a huge fan of the Jackass gross out comedy, I generally alternate between laughing, saying "no way" and wanting to puke (which I guess is the general idea). I have watched all the movies though and did find the first couple really funny, Jackass 3D has its moments, but it lacks the ingenuity and hilarity of the previous films.

With this one we watched the jet scene several times, OMG funny, but I almost vomited with the "sweat suit" stunt (I can still barely think about it). The shi!!ing train eruption and duck hunting was pretty funny too.

Sad to see Ryan Dunn in his last movie. Remember him with that matchbox car up his ass in movie #1. 07.11

90 more minutes of 9 likable and entertaining guys performing dangerous and utterly hysterical stunts and pranks. That's what we were promised. That's exactly what we get. Adding 3D to the franchise, this carries on the formula from Number 2 (Still haven't seen the first) with great enthusiasm. The jokes, screams, laughs, groans, gross out humour and jaw dropping stunts just keep coming. Like the 2nd this is a strong piece of documentary filmmaking. Cinematically, some of the shots are pretty good and it's edited very well. The actors are all just being themselves which makes the unique and more interesting, and they are all very funny. The film also seems to be a nostalgic tribute to when the show first started, so there's absolutely heaps of stuff for long term fans to enjoy. In general, Jackass 3D is the equivalent to being hit in the face by a heavy ball launched from a catapult.

Despite the high fun factor, Jackass 3D can feel like a step backwards. The stunts feel less bold than they were in the second one and it's not quite as funny. I watched both on the same day and while the stunts are bigger, they're not quite as funny. The novelty does wear off eventually, but most of the time this takes the comedy genre to surreal, delirious and disgusting new levels. J3D is one of the most insane films ever made just like its predecessor but in the best possible way. It is once again adults only acquired taste viewing and will disgust many. If you haven't seen any Jackass before and you decide to watch this- brace yourself. I enjoyed this movie overall even if it felt like the Jackass team are beginning to slightly run out of decent stunts. They've still got plenty of style and plenty of gross out fun up their sleeves. Jackass 4 anyone?

Jackass 3(D) was humorous, disturbing, and urged you to vomit. Oh, and there was also a lot of d**k. Ladies, if you feel that you have seen a plethora of "the girls" in films and want to see some more manly parts, go see J*ck*ss 3. The decision of whether it impresses or not, I will leave up to you.

Most films in theatres have some sort of plot accompanied by rising action, crisis, falling action, etc. J*ck*ss 3(D) is essentially a bunch of clips pasted together, lacking a story. Depending on what you look for in a film and what you expect out of this movie, your opinion will vary. Although, I must say, it was nice to get out and see something that was straight humour  it made me leave in an upbeat mood with nothing to think about but which stunt was my favourite.

What I regret is seeing the film in 3D. You would think it would make a difference in a prank movie, but really, there wasn't anything that did. The three bucks I spent (again) on those 3D glasses (because some f***ing assholes will not let you reuse your old ones, prompting you to buy them every time) would have been better spent on a day pass for parking (whilst being the owner of a parking pass).

Since it's almost impossible to review this movie without revealing some of what happens, be aware that what follows is considered as spoiler alert, so don't read it if you don't wanna hear about it before you see it. But even if you do, I won't reveal that much. 

SPOILER ALERT

So really, what would a J*ck*ss movie be without a real j*ck*ss? With the classic game of pin the tail on the donkey morphed into a Jackass stunt, Chris Pontius endures the pain of a donkeys hooves whilst practically naked. Ouch.

Another ouch in the movie involved waxing. Midget (as referred to in the movie), chubby guy, superglue. That's all I have to say.

Speaking of midgets, have you ever seen a whole army of them? No worries, J*ck*ss 3(D) has got it covered. I desperately want to tell you what kind of "army" this is, but you just have to see it for yourself. 

Though pretty much everything in this movie is painful either psychologically or physically, it's nice to recall that you aren't the one experiencing the discomfort, or at least not the pain. This brings me back to a point in the movie where Steve-o was buckled into a porta-potty and plunged hundreds of feet into the air. Oh, did I mention the porta-potty was full of dog sh*t? Mmm, tasty.

With plenty of animal feces and animals themselves, this is one nasty and attention- catching J*ck*ss movie. If you've viewed previous J*ck*ss movies and did not enjoy them, you will probably not enjoy this one. If you have never seen a Jackass movie, I encourage you to try this one out. But if you've enjoyed Jackass movies so far, you will definitely love J*ck*ss 3(D).

This is the best film in the series, and I laughed quite a bit, surprisingly, but I can honestly say now that I've had my fill of Jackass movies. I wasn't a huge fan of the first two, so I was quite surprised by how funny this was. It still has its misses, but many more laughs than the first two. A lot of them are there for the sake of shock value, but many of them manage to be quite funny. The pit of snakes and the beehive teatherball are just two of many funny scenes. Actors such as Sean William Scott show up as well. I can't really tell you if the 3D augmented anything because I saw this on DVD a couple years ago, but I can tell you that it does have a surprising amount of laughs

Final Thoughts: Best in the series by far, but that doesn't mean I want any more sequels coming out. I'm not sure how much farther they can go to be honest

The third in the popular Jackass franchise, this movie breaks all barriers with the relentless grossness, explicitness and amazing stunts. Knoxville and crew perform so many hardcore stunts that you will be left with your mouth agape at many occasions. The sequences are ingenuous and vomit inducing and those with a weak heart and stomach should stay away from this. All the others are welcome to see this and be amazed and repelled at the same time. Had a great time. 4 out of 5. Delivers more, much more then what its premise promised. no wonder it went on to earn 117 million dollars which is kind of amazing considering there is not a single star or story. Two thumbs up.

Jacka 3 (2010)

*** (out of 4) 

Needless to say this movie isn't going to be for everyone but if you enjoy watching people torture themselves while you sit comfortably on your couch then this is a must see. With Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and the gang are back in this latest installment and after watching it you really have to wonder how low they will go if they want another one released. This one here reaches pretty high on the foul and vile department especially a sequence towards the end with Steve-O flying and coming down with something that I won't spoil. If you've already seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about and I really don't see how they're going to top something like this. There are some even crazier moments including one skit where grandpa is making out with his granddaughter, which is priceless and especially the reaction of the man witnessing it. One of the most memorable sequences has the guys using super glue to rip off each other's body hair. I'm really curious to what these guys get paid to do this. Either way, obviously this film isn't going to be for everyone but if you can put up with the abuse these guys go through then you're going to be in for a good time. I would argue that the first two films were a tad bit better as there are a few gags here that don't work all that well but for the most part the film still delivers enough to make it worth viewing for fans of the series.

You already know the jist of this: crazy aging skaters take turns participating in some of the dumbest stunts imaginable, on a constant quest to one-up each other. The squad is beyond trying to convert any non-fans, if they were ever interested in that to begin with, and at this point are just indulging themselves while there's still a shimmer of spotlight left to enjoy. It's definitely their most expensive endeavor to date, which opens the door to some outrageous stuff, but by its grand finale the joke has worn pretty thin. I had a constant smile on my face from start to finish, though a few recycled gags from previous episodes made the belly-busters less frequent than before. Since I don't own a 3D TV, I can't comment on that aspect of it - the few instances where the technology is put to use are pretty obvious, though, and while they'd be a cute addition in one or two scenarios I'm not exactly mourning their absence. There's nothing new here, for better or for worse.

This was the craziest thing I've ever watched.

Funny, idiots, nasty, disgusting, mesmerized, that were my comments during the movie. 

I cracked all the time especially for the nasty things, not all people love this scene though. 

I admit that I don't but it was just too funny, however I made a pledge not to watch this movie again, one time only. 

I must say, they're a genius, thinking of idiot ways to kill themselves but can amuse people who watch it. 

I don't really this movie but I give this movie big applause.
