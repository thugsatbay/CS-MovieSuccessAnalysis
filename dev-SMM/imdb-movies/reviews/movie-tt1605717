I went to see Frank at the Ritzy Picturehouse in Brixton with my wife. I was not expecting much; I tend to dislike rock biopics and the whole premise of man-in-giant-papier-mache-head thing seemed gimmicky.

Frank is wonderful. The comedy is effortless, the dialogue is smart but not pretentious, the performances are elegant and understated. Fassbender is great and the head thing really works for him. 

One of the real pleasures of this film is its narrative depth. The story arcs of the protagonists manage to be wholly natural and yet surprisingly subversive. At no point does the film simplify or 'talk down' to the audience.

The music is good too.

Go see it. Go see it while it is still in the cinema.

Michael Fassbender dons a huge fake head in the enjoyable Frank showing at Sundance London. The movie is a fictionalised account based on a book written by journalist Jon Ronson who also co wrote the screenplay. In the 1980s Ronson played keyboards in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band in which Frank wore a big fake head and nobody outside his inner circle knew his true identity.

In a small quiet English seaside town Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) tries to pursue his passion for writing songs in between working at his humdrum day job. Even given his undoubted enthusiasm for trying to be creative Jon struggles to actually write anything even vaguely resembling a half decent couple of lyrics. On Twitter he likes to tweet his songwriting status or more the lack of it along with updates on what he is eating for lunch. But when a band comes to town and their keyboard player goes off the rails he sees opportunity knocking to join the band for an actual gig. Shortly after he finds himself travelling with the band to Ireland to record an album which ends up taking him on a pretty epic journey.

Jon's new band members are a weird, odd bunch of characters which include the slightly crazed and volatile Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Don (Scoot McNairy) an ex-keyboard player of the band who now operates as a kind of manager, and then there's Frank the band's enigmatic front man played by Fassbender and who insists on wearing an over-sized fake head at all times.

Frank is a hard film to easily define and although it manages to remain on the right side of upbeat with plenty of laughs it does gently broach issues revolving around mental health. The exploits of the band trying to make a album touch on notions of artistic endeavour, originality and the sphere that songwriters and musicians have to encounter in trying to be creative.

While generally having to be the subject of suspicion and hostility enforced by most of the band Jon is encouraged by Frank's friendship and welcome remarks about his on the face of it tragically lame attempts at songwriting and starts to be become more emboldened about his actual merits and worthiness. Gleeson does a terrific job in portraying his character Jon's transformation and voyage from awkward geeky young dude trying hard to fit in, to feeling like he was the main man in charge of the band's destiny and even catalyst towards the success he so craves. Ultimately though a hard lesson in self discovery awaits him.

The movie keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and trying to work out the main characters and how they interact with each other. In the history of bands there are lots of examples of artistic spats, personal issues and tragedies, conflicts, inner working quirks and inspiration which are all evident in Frank.

Summing up Frank is a thoughtful, imaginative and amusing piece of work making for a hugely watchable and enjoyable movie.

Frank is probably the hardest film that I have ever watched to describe to someone who has never watched it. After viewing I had literally nothing to say. This is because it was a truly excellent watch. 

I was initially attracted to 'Frank' by its strange and wacky trailer with promised an insane black comedy.

The first hour of Frank delivers on this completely and it is hugely entertaining. Some of the funniest scenes that I've seen at the cinema this year. This in my mind is properly revised comedy, until the film which is currently sitting at the top of the box office charts 'bad neighbours.' Anyways i digress.

During the last portion of the film there is a massive shift in the films tone, which could have easily been extremely jarring for the viewer but it is delivered in such a way that it only seems natural. This is when I decided that I did truly love the film. Not only was i capable of making me laugh but then also then to look at the more serious end of the coin. 

I don't think that 'Frank' will make anywhere near as much money as some of the larger blockbuster which came out this week, but I done believe that it will linger in the memory of those who watch it. I can almost guarantee that Frank will become a cult classic over time. 

(Also the soundtrack is bloody brilliant)

Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies fit pretty easily into a genre: drama, comedy, action, etc. This latest from film festival favorite Lenny Abrahamson is tough to classify. It begins with silly and funny inner-dialogue from an aspiring musician/songwriter (Domhnall Gleeson), transitions into a dark dramady with complex characters and dialogue, and finishes as a bleak statement on mental illness and the music business.

That's more than I would typically disclose, but some have described the film as an outright comedy and I find that unconcsionable. If you are expecting a laugh riot, you will not only be disappointed, but are likely to miss the unique perspective provided.

The screenplay is written by "The Men Who Stare at Goats" collaborators Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Clearly inspired by the late British comedian and musician Chris Sievey (and his character Frank Sidebottom), Mr. Ronson's work with Mr. Sievey is the driving force. It's also the reason Gleeson's character is emphasized over Michael Fassbender's titular character who dons the paper mache head for the bulk of the movie. This script decision probably keeps the film from being truly great.

The exceptional and attention-grabbing first 15 minutes set up a movie that dissolves into an exploration of the creative process within mental illness ... Franks states numerous times that he has a certificate (certifiable). There is also an ongoing battle between art and commerce, as waged by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and that of Gleeson. Social Media power is on full display as this avant-garde performance art band gathers a huge following prior to ever really producing any music.

Without seeing Frank's facial expressions, we witness his transformation from mystic/guru to an unstable and socially uncomfortable dude striving for likability, but unsure what the term really means. Must artists suffer for their art? Why does society latch onto the newest social media gimmick? What is creative success and why are so many afraid of it? The film begs these and other unanswerable questions. Certainly interesting, but definitely not 90 minutes of laughter.

Funny, endearing movie led with a strange, flinty charm by Domhnall Gleeson, and expertly directed by Lenny Abrahamson. Within what is fundamentally a straightforward story, a lot of themes are packed - artistic credibility, the easy triumph of mediocrity, the nature of identity and individuality. And there are more. Too many, really.

The writers are keen to maintain a light tone, as if wary that the heavier themes might weigh us all down too much. Fortunately they have two major, definitely not mediocre, talents on hand to maintain the required balance: Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who are both amazing. For Fassbender in particular there needs to be a special award for succeeding in being intensely moving whilst wearing a false head.

So although the movie as a whole doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts, it is nonetheless a wonderfully quirky, often hilarious, strangely touching piece of work. Well worth seeing and supporting.

So Frank is a great film. Let's be clear, this is not a bio-pic. It was inspired by Frank Sidebottom in so much as the story is about a band whose front man wears a big papier-mâché head.

It's a really lovely story of an odd group of musicians and their new keyboard player Jon. The musicians are all a bit barking and the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal is the craziest. The whole cast are superb and Michael Fassbender is excellent under the head as well as showing that he is a great vocalist too.

The film is engaging, funny and moving.It also made me jump more than any horror movie ever has. It has some wonderful scenes that made me laugh out loud and the direction is just beautiful with some truly clever touches.

It starts with a very unusual aural soundscape that draws you in immediately and finishes with the band's songs playing over the credits that guarantee you won't leave until the final note of "Lone Standing Tuft".

Incidentally a documentary about Frank Sidebottom is in production right now and Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story will be out soon.

I happened to see the trailer for a movie I had never heard of, called Frank, at 8:45AM this Saturday morning. Within five minutes of seeing the preview, I found that the Angelika Theater at Mockingbird Station was the only place in Dallas showing this wonderfully bizarre looking movie, and by 10:20AM, I was sitting in a dark room with about twelve other people, waiting to see just what this giant paper-mache head had in store for us.

Maybe I should step back to explain that last part. Frank revolves around an avant-garde musician names Frank, who is never seen without an oversized paper-mache mask on. The trailer promised quirky indie escapism, possibly some decent music, and some references to SXSW  ahhh, there is such beauty in under-promising and over-delivering.

For a brief moment, it feels like Frank will be little more than a stylized fictional Behind The Music type of movie because the central narrative is observed and reported from the viewpoint of an involved outsider, the new guy in the band. The outsider point of view is a perfect choice, however, because the audience then has the same questions as the narrator so we're all in it together. Is the end product of music/art as important as the process of creating it or who you create it with? Frank captures the ambition and compulsion of creating art and very harshly slaps away any generalizations of how or why an artist is the way he is. The paper- mache head isn't a gimmick for the movie or the music.

On the topic of music, Frank and his band The Soronprfbs, are easily ranked in the top five fictional bands  The Wonders(That Thing You Do), Stillwater(Almost Famous), Eddie & The Cruisers(Eddie & The Crusiers), Wylde Ratttz(Velvet Goldmine), and The Soronprfbs(Frank). The music falls somewhere between The Flaming Lips, Jim Morrison, and an extremely catchy coffee shop rambler.

The band is absolutely mesmerizing every single second they are on the screen and much of that credit has to go to Michael Fassbender. Because we can't see his face, every bit of emotion must be poured out elsewhere. Fassbender delivers an extremely physical performance. From the combination of his hands and voice, to the way he shuffles when uncomfortable, to the way he loses control when he sings, the small crowd that happens to see Frank this year will be seeing one of the best performances of 2014.

It has been almost two days since I saw Frank and I still can't get it out of my mind. Maybe it's the music or maybe it's the acting but I think the bigger reason is that it asks the questions I thought only I had. How does someone create something both abstract and powerful? What part of my brain should I be tapping into? Why can't I? Frank is a photograph of the special brand of artistic jealousy that wants to be or at least be part of something bigger and better than ourselves, all while realizing the privilege of simply getting to be witness to that greatness.

Frank is certainly a film that I thought had a lot of good and bad points. The story is unique and Frank is a very mysterious character. Most of the film takes place in a nice remote setting which adds a great atmosphere.

The acting throughout from all the cast is of a very good standard. Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic and executed the jokes to perfection. I particularly enjoyed when we heard his thoughts/updates out loud, there were very funny at the start of the film. The humour overall is dry but works for the most part. Apart from Jon's thoughts out loud I would say the hot tub scene was also quite memorable.

The film takes a tragic turn midway through and the band also progress. I felt that after an hour the novelty wore off slightly and it became very tedious to watch, I really started to lose interest. The second half of the film didn't really work for me and I felt disappointed after such a great start. The film wasn't engaging enough to make me connect to the characters as the serious stuff happened but it was very enjoyable when it was more on the comedy side.

A well made film with great performances that unfortunately lost its way towards the end. Some will love it, some will hate it and I can see both sides to that argument. Overall I would say 5/10.

The film Frank and its title character both offer a weird exterior but beneath the quirkiness is a familiar arching goal and story structure dedicated to resolving a psychological crisis. It could be a criticism of the film that it buries its conventional resolutions and codas deep beneath the strange behaviour of its characters. Yet it is also using this conventionality to express the truth and desires about the character Frank (played by Michael Fassbender). Although Frank wears a giant head to hide his face from the world and even the members of his rock 'n' roll band, underneath is an unstable but real person whose most relatable aims are to reinvent himself and his identity to achieve total uniqueness. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, from a screenplay by Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy screenwriter Peter Straughan and Jon Ronson, Frank is at its best when it finds funny variations on parodying the difficulties of the creative process. An artist isn't expressing their work to themselves but to other people. Is it more acceptable to be weird and unique, but detached from others, or generic and predictable? The way the film generates these questions after an initial viewing heightens its value and relevancy. 

The film is loosely based on the experiences of its screenwriter Jon Ronson, who met the real life comedic character Frank Sidebottom. The Guardian posted an extract from Ronson's book Frank: The True Story that Inspired the Movie. He describes how in 1987 he was asked to fill-in as a keyboard player for the punk band The Freshies, led by Chris Sievey. Frank was Sievey's invention. On stage he would wear the giant papier- mache head and would only responded to being called Frank. The character wore a 1950s style suit and sang on stage with what Ronson called a "high-pitched nasal twang". Frank's story was that he still lived at home with his parents and his goal was to become a pop star. The character grew in popularity by covering popular songs and also by appearing on radio and television shows. In the extract, Ronson struggles to understand why Sievey kept the head on for so long and also the fluctuations in his weird and irrational behaviour. He likened Sievey to being transgender and trapped in the wrong body. 

To protect Sievey from speculations about how obsessive he was about Frank, Ronson decided to fictionalise the film version. The differences in the real story and the film are sizeable. The film is set in the present day Britain, allowing for light references to social media like Youtube, Twitter and view counts. In the film Frank (Fassbender) has no alter ego. He is a mystery because he refuses to remove the head, even in the shower. This perspective of Frank is drawn from Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), a young man with a boring day job who is looking for inspiration for his music career. One day he is invited to play with Frank's band "The Soronprfbs". The band is compromised of Don the manager (Scott McNairy), who has his own fetishes, a Frenchman (Francois Civil), a female drummer (Carla Azar) and also Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who intensely dislikes Jon for moving in on the group. After a failed gig, the band takes an unexpected detour to a lakeside cabin in Ireland where they attempt to compose an album using Frank's unconventional methods of musical recordings and rehearsals. 

One of the largest payoffs for Ronson and Straughan's script is forwarding the narrative a year while the group is in the cabin. The time shift is unexpected and lends itself to the film's thematic and comic structure: the friction between the band members as they sometimes hilariously fail to achieve artistic uniqueness. There is great variation in how the film draws humour from this second act. Slapstick is a strong device with Frank recording the sounds of his gumboots or a toothbrush or when Jon tries out a new method of shaving, which I thought was the film's funniest moment. Characterising the band members with black, self-deprecating nudges is essential in preserving the comic energy too. The way Don hints about Frank's unstable upbringing and his own quirks involving mannequins inspires some funny dialogue riffs on the way artists posture about having tragic upbringings and childhoods. There has never been a successful artist who wasn't miserable. While Frank is treated like an awe-inspiring idol of mystery, some of the side characters like Clara are as obscure because we see few other sides to them when they could have been more rounded.

It is slightly disappointing that the laughs don't carry into a shabby third act in America. Some of the disjointedness between the locations could be intentional to reflect Frank's unease and nervousness but it still feels dislocated from the previous two acts. The film also sheds a lot of its comic wit in favour of a more sombre and serious tone that emerges almost out of nowhere followed by a simple and easy conclusion that seems formulaic in its message about speaking truthfully to find proper artistic rewards. It is odd that the film starts to edge towards those same painful upbringings that it initially parodied. Perhaps with more time with Frank the man instead of the image it might have been a more moving ending to the story. Yet since watching the film, Frank has grown on me because of the weight of the ideas about creativity and complacency. It also relishes an interesting cast who aren't renowned for their comic traits. Sometimes the chances of being a little different or strange pay off and sometimes they don't. It is the joy and the pain of any art form.

I don't actually have any way to start about this. The cinematography, the acting, the jokes (or lack there of) and the overall feeling are done quite well. The problem is, I didn't hear a chord of music worth listening or a verse that made any sense whatsoever. Then I realized that the movie is not about music at all, and that the whole thing serves as some kind of therapy, after you see that the keyboard player wanted to commit suicide, and a whole lot other crap happening with the members of the band. The first part of the movie looked like a mock to all the nowadays music and the musicians, showing the lack of talent and the ignorance in all of it. Afterwards, you realize that they're all mental patients and that it's not about the music at all. Now, after we digested this fact alone, what is left is still not satisfying or artistic. It might as well been a story about autistic children making charity gifts. There is nothing there to look at, honestly. As much as I wanted to have something learned and felt from the film, I only actually felt sorry for the characters, which is well not worth the money or the time. Sorry, Fassbender, this is a low for you.

Graceful, melancholic, and sweetly charming even while being very funny, a fantastic film. Very meticulous in its pacing, it's restrained and surprisingly atmospheric too. The performances play a large part as to why it works so well. Michael Fassbender is definitely one of my five favorite actors working right now, he's given great performances all throughout the last several years, and this may stand as one of his very very best. I guess it's going to be hard for many people to look past the fact that we don't see his face (especially when it comes to awards season) but what he does with his vocal expressions is pretty magnificent, and a total transformation. Most times it hardly sounds like the Fassbender we've all heard, if at times even not at all. The only other male performance of 2014 to rival Fassbender's here is James McAvoy's turn in Filth. Domhnall Gleeson is also pretty great in a less showier part, especially great in the film's last act. Maggie Gyllenhaal has also never been better, although I admit that I haven't seen a lot of her work. This is truly great stuff, sad and funny in a way last year's brilliant Inside Llewyn Davis was. This also has a scene that is to me the hardest I've laughed this year.

"Frank" explores the fine and not-so-fine line between creative genius and insanity. Although you might assume a movie about an alternative rock band with a lead singer who wears a giant fake head that he never takes off would be a work of fiction, the truth, as they say, is stranger, and provides a compelling basis for a movie.

"Frank" is co-written by Jon Ronson based on his experience playing keyboard in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band in the late '80s. Frank Sidebottom was the alter ego of a man named Chris Sievey, who wore a giant fake head almost identical to the one Frank (Michael Fassbender) wears in the movie. Ronson based the film's main character, Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) on himself; both real and fictional Jon found themselves randomly in this band, ditching their existing lives in pursuit of musical greatness, trying to make sense of the enigma of the man in the giant head.

With screenwriter Peter Straughan's ("Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy") help, Ronson dives into a fictional replication of his experience with the band. Gleeson's Jon is an aspiring songwriter completely lacking in inspiration who gets an unusual opportunity to play a gig for an experimental band called Soronprfbs after he witnesses their keyboardist attempting to drown himself. Jon has the time of his life and agrees to travel to Ireland with the group, only to discover it's not a road trip to play a few shows, but a retreat at which the unorthodox Frank will stop at nothing until he's recorded an astounding new album.

For all the mystery shrouding his character, Frank is far from the most eccentric band member. In fact, he's the most congenial. We also learn about the other keyboardist, Don's (Scoot McNairy), volatile history with mental illness and musician Clara's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) propensity for violence. Unsurprisingly, Jon's gleaning from it all is that deep adversity and mental anguish is a pre- requisite to talent.

Director Lenny Abrahamson brings a natural yet surreal quality that honors the weirdness of the story, while also helping us access the psychology of the characters and take interest in what's happening in a very rooted way. He keeps the reality of what's going on with its characters in play while experimenting with a number of scenes that push the bizarreness to varying levels. There are elements of black comedy, but also of honest, soul-stirring truth.

The first half of "Frank" focuses more on the creative process and the mental headspace necessary to operate at peak creativity. When Jon signs them up for a very promising gig and begins pushing his own creative agenda, forcing the story to leave the confines of the Ireland vacation home, the film turns to examine the real pain of its characters and what happens to creativity when complications of fandom and notoriety enter the mix.

Throughout it all we see a gradual change in Jon as a character, and he becomes less likable because of all that his dreams and naiveté have wrought. This has a slightly adverse effect on the viewing experience, making it kind of painful to watch all these troubled characters with their misguided attitudes drown themselves in a sea of expectations and principles. At the same time, this leads to an honest, moving redemptive arc in the final half hour of the movie, when this bizarre flower of a story opens up to reveal its fragile insides.

"Frank" can feel rough and disjointed tonally at points and grow a little irksome, but much like how a band with a weird sound still has artistic integrity somewhere underneath that drives that creative choice, "Frank" stays committed to looking at talent, creativity and mental illness in a very authentic, productive way that makes it worth the quirks.

Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, "Frank" stars Michael Fassbender as Frank, a mysterious musician who always wears a papier-mache mask. In need of a keyboardist, Frank hires Jon (Domhnall Gleeson). The duo isolate themselves for several months, determined to put together an experimental album.

Interesting, creepy and a little bit sad, "Frank" sketches a broad portrait of today's music scene. This is a world in which gimmicks attract listeners, in which anything marginally odd is deemed revolutionary, in which bands remain unnoticed unless they pander to mainstream trends, in which talentless leeches saddle up to gravy trains, in which even the humblest men harbour dreams of celebrity, in which mental illness is misidentified as genius, in which physical and psychological disorders hinder artists as much as help them, and in which social media alters how music is consumed and promoted.

Though populated by fine actors (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy in particular), it is Michael Fassbender who steals the show. Though we rarely see his face, Fassbender imbues his character with a range of emotions, Frank oscillating from godlike superhuman to insecure man-child. In Frank's mask, Jon sees what he wants to see: a legend, a God, a pathway to celebrity. The truth, though, turns out to be far more disturbing.

7.9/10  To see this material done slightly better, see: "Ghost World", "Art School Confidential", "The Devil and Daniel Johnston", "Bound for Glory", "Mister Lonely" and "Exit Through the Gift Shop".

watching this movie led me to have mixed emotions.the movie was sad, playful, weird and absurd. it felt like all those emotions had been pushed into a blender and served. thats exactly what this movie made me feel. definitely a unique movie.

the plot of the movie was original and i definitely enjoyed it. the acting was good and weird which quiet frankly only helped to maintain the eccentric feel of the movie. which is a good thing. acting especially from the likes of Michael fassbender, Maggie gyllenhaal and domnhall gleeson was absolutely amazing.

would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good watch.

Untalented as a songwriter but nevertheless set on making it as a musician, a young Irishman quits his day job to join an eccentric band whose lead singer dons a papier-mâché mask that he never removes in this offbeat drama. Domhnall Gleeson is fine as the milquetoast young protagonist who becomes more and more of an authoritative voice in the band and Michael Fassbender has some solid moments in a mostly voice-only performance as the singer; his observation about normal human faces being a little strange themselves certainly resonates. The talents of the two leads are, however, hardly maximised here. Stories about the rise and falls of bands are a dime a dozen and 'Frank' does little to distinguish itself other than the mask, which soon becomes more of an annoying gimmick than delightful quirk as it distracts from Gleeson's character growth. The music is hardly great either, though the film's weakest area is its supporting characters; it is hard to feel for the band's highs and lows when we only get to know two of them in depth. Then there is the love-hate relationship between Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal which never rings true. Having Gleeson constant tweet about his experiences with his tweets appearing over the action is a further jarring touch that subtracts from the immediacy of the action. Director Lenny Abrahamson would of course later go on to score an Oscar nomination for directing 'Room'. This earlier effort is a strikingly different sort of motion picture at least and may be of interest to those retrospectively exploring his filmmaking origins.

A beautiful film, extremely well done body acting by Michael Fassbender and very fun score. I still have the soundtrack and listen to the closing song almost weekly. The score imitates pretentious indie culture music and pokes at the lack of talent it can take to make music. 

While mockingly pretentious, it is still enjoyable and not *too* artsy fartsy. It's odd characters and dialogue create a mystical quirky feel to it that had me thinking about . Lots of the funny parts are done in the classic dry British humor, mixed with sarcasm. It also had parts that were just childish and fun, and brought out the humour of the entire situation in the plot. 

Although it plays around with satire and nihilism, it also features some dark moments and messages about suicide and depression, in a very realistic manner.

I'd say the movie only falls short in plot progression as it slows towards one part, but otherwise the acting, cinematography, score, and writing are all top notch.

Frank follows an aspiring musician who gets recruited by a band led by an eccentric lead singer who wears a paper mache head. 

For starters this is a very unique movie, much more so than I expected. It seems like everyone is just a little insane, and it gives the movie a cartoonish, somewhat over-the-top vibe that I really enjoyed seeing. And yet it was still realistic. The characters are relatable in some ways, and most all of them are a lot of fun to watch. 

The way the movie decides to use comedy is always very natural. It never goes out of it's way to make jokes, but rather uses a lot of comedic imagery as it comes. It uses Frank's paper mache head in this way often, and thus it never feels out of place because this guy wears the head everywhere. It knows what it is and uses that fact to it's advantage. And when it isn't imagery, it's from the characters and it still works incredibly well. 

Probably the best aspect of the movie is the characters. Yes, they're a lot of fun, but there is plenty of emotional investment in them too. Despite their instabilities, I completely fell in love with them. Most of them seem to go deeper than what the audience sees, save for maybe two of them, whom I often forgot about. Regardless, they weren't unlikable characters so it was mostly forgivable. 

The music is actually pretty good. It all sounds very unique, and it does a great job of selling the motives of the main characters to create different music, or sometimes even use psychology to make great music. Furthermore, the soundtrack is great for the movie, as everything is already so weird that normal music just wouldn't work. 

Overall Frank is great. The characters, the acting, the comedy, the music, everything is great. It's a blast to watch and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.

A Bunch of Unstable People Spend Too Much Time in a Cabin to Record Music, What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

Last time a movie kept me awake at night was The Ring. Horror movies can do that but can a comedy film do that to you? Frank did, for completely different reasons. I could not bring myself to write a review for about a month. Kept telling myself, it's not going to be easy. Its not hard to tell you the story but to describe the incredibly layered symbolism is tricky. If I tell you that its about a bunch of post-industrial experimental rock musicians making music in a cabin in the woods then you might think its just another indie hipster band docudrama. Then you should know that Michael Fassbender plays the lead singer of the band who wears a fake head all the time. Sounds quirky right? Now why would an A list star take a role in a movie that doesn't let him show his face for the entirety of the film? Because Fassbender can act with his body. Now you might think that's really not helpful but you really need to watch the movie to experience what I'm talking about. It's insane! Did I tell you about Maggie Gyllenhaal's theremin playing role in this movie? She can pull off those nutty characters so well. 

Talking of insanity, Frank is an inner journey to discover whether madness is elemental to creativity. Can true art be produced without going crazy? Or is it that all artistic geniuses are born with mental issues? The answer is not very encouraging for the emotionally balanced "intellectuals" who try to measure art through popular conventions. Frank shows a remarkable insight into creative minds and the eccentricity that is sometimes uncontrollable. Why do die-hard fans lose interest in a band when they get too commercial? Because they can't find the insanity and heart in the music anymore. There is only so much creativity you can tap in once you turn your art into a factory produced product. 

Frank hit me in the place where it hurts the most. My own failed music career. None of my band members were ever so insane and naturally gifted. Makes me wonder if this what it takes to make really good music? It completely disarms you. If you are a struggling musician then probably don't watch this movie because you might throw your guitar or piano or drum kit in the river the next day. As for me, I'm already retired. I just had to watch Our Idiot Brother to shake off my mood. But Frank made me laugh too. There were some familiar moments and I felt at home with the characters. They were all so flawed and unhinged. Like some modern spiritual successors of 'I am the Walrus'. Frank also made me cry because it brought back some memories. People cried when Led Zeppelin reunited for one last time also when Nirvana played at their Hall of Fame induction. These are happy moments but they are also emotional ones. Reunions always are.

Frank is so much more than a stark psychotic drama. It is a heightened dig into the heads of brilliant characters you might have trouble getting a proper read on. It is loosely inspired on the life of Frank Sidebottom (Chris Sievey) and has been curdled fictitiously into a gorgeous account.

OUTSTANDING FRANK CHARACTERS To see everything through the sane eyes of the protagonist Jon Burroughs played superbly by Domhnall Gleeson was a delight per se. His character would shoehorn you into his shoes to help you get a better insight into the story. You soon get an endearing perspective on a peculiar persona who prefers to stay behind a mask, come what may.

Clara played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy's Don are uncanny characters as well, aced by both the actors to perfection. Visual landscapes captured in the movie are magnificent, so is understanding the madness in every little thing. Lenny Abrahamson's direction is simply mind-boggling that ices the work of Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan beautifully.

ITCHY BRITCHES SPOILERS AHEAD Michael Fassbender, the guy behind the papier mache cover, is the very definition of queer but he is simply fascinating when you get to know him better. He is the hidden force that keeps everyone together. You can get an idea about the gravity in his character with his lyrics primarily because for the most part you can't really see the expressions he hides underneath the veil.

Things don't stop tumbling towards the bizarre vale yet, as you get to know all the band members gradually, with the aid of Jon's interaction with them. The movie is laced out with their insanity and their extreme love for music. Frank is the crux of the tale as the world Jon writes down is brimming up with love for him in every way. He is a very interesting character but unfortunately like most members of his band is suffering from a mental illness that Jon ploughs out slowly.

What was sad to find out was the world didn't really share Jon's enthusiasm, rather liked the hilarity of the group. He realizes eventually that he was trying to mould something irreparable, and then tries to make amends.

WHAT CONSTANTLY WORKS FOR FRANK What works for this movie is its light humour and its surreal oddity, a misplaced feel of melodrama that weaves it into a majestic outcome. An intelligently built movie that ends with Jon setting things right again, the way things were in the first place, bizarre yet tied down by a single tinge of togetherness.

I watched this based purely on the IMDb score thinking to myself "It'll be different". Well different it was. I can honestly say that at no time did it really catch me or keep me even remotely entertained.

By the time I had got a good bit through I just thought "Well I've got this far................"

Couldn't and wouldn't recommend it. Only thing i found relatively interesting was one of the female characters that I can't remember her name (shows how interested I was) had a nice boobs. Sad day when that is the highlight of your movie.

Ending was gash too. It just stopped.

I didn't expect much from Frank other than from what I heard was a stellar performance from Michael Fassbender but boy was I in for a surprise. Frank is easily one of my most top 20 films of all time and I really do love this film. Almost all of the characters are great and complex from Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Don (Scoot McNairy), and of course none other than Frank (Michael Fassbender). These characters are all superb and the only 2 people I really had trouble with were the other 2 band members other than whatever his name was having a french accent he was forgettable and so was the woman who played the drums. Frank was a different movie and often took turns and was quite fun in the sense that it was truly unpredictable something that is almost impossible to find in modern day films, the film provided interesting characters and music. Now I must say the music in Frank is an acquired taste but it's unpredictable and in that way I think it mirrors the film. I'm not quite sure if Frank is on Blu-ray seeing as that I watched it on Netflix but if it is pick it up this movie is superb in almost every way and is truly different from anything else out there today.

I never watch a movie twice within a two week period. Did this time.

Frank reeled me in. Quirky and clever.

Well done. Gave it a 9.

Some people said not enough music - OK - kinda thought that too - but the story is really cool. More important than 1.5hrs of music.

Really good actors - I had no clue that one from 'Halt and Catch Fire' was in the movie (aside - very cool show). Sorry don't know the actor's name - but he is really good.

Also enjoyed the various locations. Europe and Texas - cool Cinematography.

Overall, an awesome movie. One of the best I've seen in a a long time.

Frank is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is, at its core, a drama film but it has some hilarious eye wetting moments. If only it could have kept that mood through out the film. Towards the end it gets too dramatic and sad and it's way too severe a shift from the previous mood.

The only other thing I could say against it is that in the beginning it tries to create a mystery about what Frank's face really looks like. Now that could be interesting, but he is played by Michael Fassbender so I already know what he looks like. So all that seemed pointless.

But despite that and the problems of unevenness Frank is still a solidly good film. It's weird and crazy, it explores human creativity. The actors do a good job in creating a bunch of quirky characters that you love to watch while exploring their near surreal world.

Overall Frank is a very watchable movie even if it somewhat loses its way towards the end.

But not only was Frank hilarious, it was really poignant and it's art house style didn't detract from what was actually a great storyline. Reminiscent of Submarine or The Double in both editing style and narrative, the characters, though odd, are really likable and amusing. It kept me laughing all the way through, and the conclusion was really heartfelt. It was a great film with awesome narrative structure and a clear message, even if that message was not necessarily what the audience wanted. I couldn't have asked for a better movie to watch tonight and I'll definitely be taking a look at the book to see how it matches up!
