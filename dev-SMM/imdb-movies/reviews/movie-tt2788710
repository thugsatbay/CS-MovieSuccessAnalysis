### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
For the sake of film criticism, I will pretend that I watched the film without the political maelstrom that has raised it to a level of interest that it would otherwise never have attained.

This is the typical mass produced, lowbrow, comedy that Hollywood cranks out to appeal to 15-year-old boys. There are a few slapstick laughs in the tradition of the Three Stooges that break the monotony. I would not elevate the film to the level of a satire as that would imply that there was some intelligent thought behind it. There is not. All the humor, both physical and verbal, is completely obvious. It will not go down in history as one of the great comedies, which is probably what upset Kim Jung Un the most.

The attempts to make political observations are all based on time-worn points (people are starving, Kim is not a god). The sections that imply Kim has psychological problems may be more irritating to the regime. Most of the attempted humor deals with Kim fighting his homophobia and dealing with a father who gave him little support.

There is no need to comment on the acting as there really is none. No one will win an Oscar nomination here. The story is predictable: You can guess what will happen before you begin watching it. It's the kind of film you watch to see a few gags and, maybe, get a few laughs. They will be very few, indeed, unless you are 15 or under. However, knowing the media attention that this film has received, it is unlikely a poor review will stop anyone from watching it. Just remember, I warned you.

Well, where do we start with this one? Obviously I watched this film knowing what kind of attention had been drawn to it, from crazy Korean hackers, terrorists threatening to bomb theatres to the US president himself. I really hoped that after all the hype it would live up to expectations. And it failed miserably. Cheap humour, jokes and dialogues below criticism most of the time, acting...well, what kind of acting would you expect if the script is not there, the list goes on. Finally, very predictable and flat story, with a major twist easy enough to predict for a 10-year old. But worst of all - the rating. Have you people lost your marbles?! I honestly wanted to give it a 4/10 and before I went on IMDb I was expecting it to be overrated at, say 6/10, but well over 8?! And we're talking over 70 000 votes! This is an insult to cinematography and any intelligent viewer alike that such a piece of garbage should get a score of 8+. It's just unreal. Therefore I'm giving it a 1/10 in a hope that the rating will be quickly brought down to where it actually belongs. It's amazing that only because the film has a political nature, people are willing to rate it so high. Rate it for what it is, don't fool other people into paying to actually see this.

Honestly I was very interested in watching this movie when I saw the trailer however almost 45 min into it I hadn't even cracked a smile. I expected a lot more from this film, especially being a big fan of seth and franco. This movie has a few puns here an there but overall a terrible movie, expect garbage. If it hadn't been for all the controversy surrounded around it I'm sure it would've gotten mediocre reviews all around. I honestly don't understand the 9+ stars from some reviewers, it's satire but not comedically well written in any sense. Save yourself the trouble, don't bother watching it. Seth and Franco gave a good performance but the movie had a lame plot and subpar lines.

The premise and subject for this movie gave the writers the opportunity for an entertaining future cult film. It could have been an entertaining political satire, the possibilities were endless. Additionally the media attention could have made for a legendary movie. Alas, no such luck. Lazy writing turned this film into a waste of a good afternoon. The entire film consists of forced situations, stupidity and shock value humour. Forced situations; When done smoothly situational humour can be very entertaining, but here the writers seem to have been too lazy to set up each situation smoothly. Instead they just force each situation into existence. Full retard; Some stupidity can often be humorous, but never go full retard. Here the main character Dave here cannot recognize a tiger, and describes it as "a strange big stripy orange dog". Apparently that's supposed to be funny. Shock value humour; Shock value is seldom entertaining, and it's a hallmark of lazy writing. When Dave isn't "going full retard" he is yelling profanities like how his genitals smell like guacamole. Aides from these themes there is nothing humorous in this flick. Save your time and money, watch something else.

The Interview has created a lot of crazy rumors and a lot of things have been making this movie one of the biggest happenings this year. A lot of speculations were made when Sony got hacked and they suspected that North Korea was behind it. This generated a lot of interest for the movie and people were talking about it over and over again. So, after several threats they decided to pull the movie from all theaters. Later on, they decided to release it for streaming purposes, and that's how we finally got to watch the hard work that was put into The Interview.

Let's get to the IMDb rating first; they are obviously fakes and there are even people on 4chan telling everyone to rate the movie a 10. This is really just to give the creators of the movie the support and love they need after suffering this sad conflict. Also, it is a great opportunity to actually show movie distribution companies that putting movies earlier to watch at home too streaming, WHILE running in cinema will generate A LOT of money. 

I got the opportunity to watch this, and I figured, what the heck, it's only 5,99 USD, so why not give it a shot, since everybody is talking about this film. Honest opinion now, a lot of reviews here are fake, by people who has NOT seen the movie. So here's your opportunity to actually read an HONEST review.

The movie is in no way perfect by all means, but it does have it's surprisingly funny and shocking moments. Yes, the movie is overloaded with toilet humor and profanity, but it does not necessarily make it a bad movie. I found a lot of the jokes mildly amusing and I chuckled through almost the whole movie with some laugh out loud-moments too. The chemistry between Franco and Rogen is perfect and they always work well together when it comes to acting. The story has set a goal in movie history, and Rogen actually had the ba lls to mock a world leader. I adore Seth's hard work into this movie and I adore everyone else who were part of this project. It's a shame that people get so butt-hurt over a f****nag comedy film. While skeptical about the movie itself, seeing as Rogen's humor is childish and contains a lot of toilet humor and continuous jokes, I found myself enjoying the whole film. The script was very well written, the characters felt real and it had the perfect blend of humor, action and drama. (and a little bit of romance, too) I found both Franco's and Rogen's performance to be flawless and the chemistry they have on screen is wonderful, making this a very believable film. However, I found Franco's character to be a little annoying, but I guess that's what they aimed for. Franco's character felt a little flawed because at one moment, he acted like he was retarded, and then the other second he's starting to act like he's some kind of Sherlock Holmes. This was a minor problem to me, but I kind of wish that they would have worked on Franco's character a little more and made him to be more believable, in my honest opinion he was annoyingly stupid and almost too stupid, even though that was what they were aiming for. They made Seth's character seem so much more intelligent than Franco. I have no idea what they were trying to do but in my personal opinion it always bothered me.

The scenes where Franco got to meet Kim Jong Un were truly amazing, but at the same time, quite awkward. Even though Kim is the bad guy, you couldn't help but feel bad for him. They actually made him a misunderstood individual, just like Franco's character, and I found that to be very funny and clever. As for the actor playing Kim, he does an amazing job and he does not waste any of his acting talents. You actually believe him as a person and that makes the movie a sh*t load better. 

I do not want to spoil the movie for you, but what I can tell you is that this surely is worth a watch at home. I would not have been pleased if it was a theatrical film, but if you're just looking for a funny film, with lots of shock humor, and Rogen humor screaming all over it, this is your choice. Turn of your brain, maybe take a beer and enjoy the movie as it is. 

Summary: The Interview was a pleasant surprise with believable character development, an interesting plot that only gets better after the second half, with plenty of toilet humor and gags that do not fail to amuse. This will most likely be the most anticipated movie of the year, or at least of 2015, causing the trouble it did, making more people interested in what made this movie so threatening and offensive to North Koreans. Sit down, grab a beer and enjoy. It is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, meaning you should not take it seriously. It is a great effort from both Rogen and Franco, and I recommend this film to everyone who can actually take a joke AND has a sense of humor, especially those who likes the type of humor Rogen has been featuring these past years.

The movie deserves a strong 7 out of 10. Hopefully, the fake ratings will be reset and The Interview will have an average rating of about 7-8.

I saw The Interview in a screening around April 2014. This was an in-production screening so much of the music and graphics were not yet complete, but the filming/sequencing/editing was complete.

It's honestly just another ridiculous Seth Rogen comedy. Rogen and Franco are portrayed as American idiots who can't do anything right, much less pull off an assassination attempt on Kim Jung Un when they are tasked to do so after scoring an exclusive interview with Franco (for whom the North Koreans are huge fans).

They fly to NK and get pampered by Kim Jong Un and his generals. Several times the Americans get "ready" to pull off the assassination but keep making mistakes (such as losing their assassination "device", or almost killing themselves in the process) to the frustration of the CIA.

Eventually a "senior official" of Kim Jung Un's finds out what they're up to and agree to help with the assassination attempt. This leads to a series of ridiculous action scenes and random buildings getting blown up, Rogen/Franco driving a tank in an attempt to escape NK, and Un himself leading a an attempt to stop the Americans from escaping.

If this movie didn't stir up so much real-life political controversy, basically no one would be talking about it a day after walking out of theaters.

This movie has been made to entertain 12-15 year old. It's not very good. Most of the jokes miss and the story isn't very good either. Seth Rogan and James Franco are wasted on this film.

I was cringing all the way through it. The jokes are totally infantile and I can't remember laughing at any of them.

This movie is best avoided. Unless of course you're under 15 years of age.

I've given it 1/10.

Yes, it's truly awful.

The publicity surrounding the movie mad me watch it.

Reading some of these reviews and I find myself looking for a pair of pliers to help some of these people remove the stick out of their ass. To note, I only made an account for this review because I was afraid some people may get the wrong idea about this movie. No, it will not win an Oscar, no it will not have an Oscar winning actor. Was Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Eddie Murray, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Bill Murray, Mike Myers, Will ferrel did a any of them win an Oscar? No, however were their movies not one of the funniest of their time? Exactly. Seth and James will not win an Oscar because the committee doesn't rate comical aspects. However this movie is hilarious. Without being one of the "typical" comedy type movies that have come out recently. It's different comical aspects then what has been common in movie cinema in the past year. Obviously it's a comedy, and in the category of comedy movies it will rank as one of the higher ones. When you watch this movie you expect that. It's not a Beautiful Mind or Titanic. It's a comedy, and a damn funny one at that. When you watch a comedy you want to laugh, and this movie will make you laugh. End of story. Please don't listen to those who critique this movie as if it is a nominees for a best movie award.

-The Interview, maybe you have heard of it, follows two idiots, played by James Franco and Seth Rogan, who host a talk show, when one day they are invited to interview Kim Jong-un. This prompts the CIA to recruit the two to 'take out' the leader of North Korea.

-I was happy to watch The Interview just to support the film industry really, but it turns out that it came with a pretty hilarious film! -The story, mainly the concept, does not wear out like Let's Be Cops, but actually gets better and better.

-The pace is pretty good and the film does not waste time. I did feel like one scene dragged, but one out of an entire film is not too bad! -The acting is especially funny with James Franco and Randall Park, who played Kim. However Seth Rogan just played the SAME. FREAKING. CHARACTER. Yeah I hate him. Anyway.

-The music was very Tarantino-esque, therefore I loved it.

-The film had me laughing right off the bat and, aside from some parts that just weren't funny, was generally hilarious throughout. Even the ending was funny, satisfying, and overall well done.

-The biggest negative is the content. It is a Seth Rogan comedy, so it is rated R. It is not that violent and only has some very brief, distant nudity. However, there is a lot of language in the film. There are some pretty iffy jokes, but it's mainly just language throughout that gives it its rating.

-So if you don't mind language and are looking for an actually funny film that is entertaining and takes an original concept to great use, The Interview is totally worth seeing in thea- oh wait, nevermind. Well you can rent it on YouTube, to it is worth that! I would honestly give The Interview an 8/10. No joke.

I downloaded this movie as soon as it went online. Living in France and having heard everything about it since the Sony hack, I just had to watch it. If North Korea is really behind the hack, and they probably are, I understand why they did it. Their Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un, gets made fun of by one amazing American journalist who just gets his way with people. I admit that the storyline is fairly straightforward, that we're expecting the "twist" here and there, in other words, it's not a masterpiece. But do we really care? I think this movie is sending a message, that even in the worst country of the world, on the brink of a potential war, we don't care about taboo. We need to talk about the issues of this country.

This movie cracked me up so many times, and knowing that there is so much drama behind it, I couldn't do anything else but to rate it 10/10. Sony, if not the two brilliant actors, deserve that.

"Konnichiwa!" 

Saw the first showing of "The Interview" on Christmas Day, and I'm very glad I did. Franco, Rogan, and Park create an unpredictable 3-way bromance with heart, energy, and more than a few subversive jabs at both North Korean and American culture.

Yes the plot is ridiculous. And to paraphrase a line from the movie, yes some of the humor is "lowbrow with a capital 'low.'" But it's the funniest of 41 movies I've seen in theaters in 2014 (so far.)

My advice: if you want to see a truly funny over-the-top farce, go see "The Interview."

You will probably walk out of the theater of boredom halfway through this movie. I loved Pineapple Express, and other flicks from these guys. But, there shtick is wearing thin these days. It is the same old stuff with Seth going "oh my god, oh my god" mostly.

Maybe it is just me, but I'm sick of these movies now. Seems like the same old crap churned out.

I'm pretty sure it was the studio that hacked itself to get some PR and hopefully fill some seats in the theaters.

You would be better served giving the 8 bucks to a random stranger on the streets then suffer through this huge steaming pile of s**t.

"The Interview" (2014 release; 112 min.) brings the story of how an entertainment reporter Dave Skylark (played by James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (played by Seth Rogen) get an opportunity to interview Kim Jong-un. the "Supreme Leader" of North Korea. As the movie opens, we see a young girl (maybe 7 or 8) sing a patriotic song for North Korean officials. The song turns hilariously into an anti-America rant. Soon thereafter, we see Skylark interview Eminem (another hilarious scene). When Skylark and Rapoport find out that Jng-un is a big fan of the show, they manage an invite to North Korea. The CIA then pays a visit and convinces the guys that they need to "take out" Jong-un. At this point we're barely 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: at this point as much needs to be said about the events surrounding the limited release of the movie as about the movie itself. Let's start with the movie itself: first and foremost, I had heard and read mixed things about the movie, so when my (grown) kids and I went to see it on Christmas day, I had pretty low expectations. Turns out the movie is actually not nearly as bad as I had been led the believe. Yes, there is stupid "potty" humor and yes, it's all very much over the top. But there are zingers left and right that will have you smile if not laugh out loud. One of the many, many examples: when Jong-un and Skylark are taking a tour of Jong-un's place, at some point they come across a huge tank. Comments Jong-un: "That was a gift to my grandfather by Stalin". Replies Skylark: "in our country, we pronounce that Stallone", ha! And on and on. Randall Park as Kim Jong-un is outstanding. Kudos also to Set Rogen, who also co-rwote and co-directed the movie.

As to the limited release, I at first was horrified that Sony gave in to the threats, but felt better when the limited Christmas day release was announced. The movie played on one screen at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and it's a good thin I had bought tickets on-line beforehand, as the matinée screening was sold out (as were all other screenings, apparently). The crowd was really into it, laughing and hollering and whooping it up. When the end titles started rolling, the crowd even gave an applause. In all, this truly was a "movie event", and all three of us were very happy we were part of it. "The Interview" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Reading all the bad comments, I was expecting something in style of Borat or Dumb and dumberer to. Or some sort of embarrassing Ben Stiller humor. Those are uncomfortable to watch. But not this, not by a long shot.

This was actually pretty okey. It wasn't some crappy humor at all, but a comedy trying to be realistic, as much as it can be for a satirical comedy. I've had quiet a few loud laughs. And I was surprised it was actually very entertaining from the beginning to the end.

I'm thinking these bad reviews either come from the North Koreans, the Chinese or people who were expecting something on a Lord Of The Rings level masterpiece.

Watch and enjoy!

I am sitting here reading all the reviews for this movie, and I am shocked to see such terrible reviews! My friend and I watched this movie and we both laughed so hard. Does no one acknowledge the humor in this movie? This movie is making so much fun of Kim Jong Un, the cruel dictator, who should not be taken seriously. This film is making him look like weak and pathetic. The Interview also demonstrates that the fearless America is not going to prevent a movie from being released just because a dictator in another country requests that it not be shown to the public; we weren't going to let that request stop us! Before watching the Interview, I read about Kim Jong Un, and it scared me to think that another "Hitler" is alive on our planet. After, watching the movie, Kim Jong Un is now a joke! The Interview may be comedy-driven rather than plot-driven, but I don't see how that makes it a bad movie. But I am a huge fan of James Franco and Seth Rogen and a movie with both of them together (Pineapple Express - 2008) is outstanding. Everything about the Interview cracked me up and I hope Kim Jong Un realizes how cruel he is. I really do think this movie deserved to be released to let Kim Jong Un know that we don't fall to a dictator. 

All respect goes to Seth and James!

I can't help but think of Dennis Rodman when watching this movie. Our main hero seems to mock Dennis's understanding of reality and basic comprehension of the world. Our hero, aside from being horribly racist and unsympathetic to Asian stereotypes, he is a pretty innocent guy who get's fooled by the supreme ruler. Later he finds out the truth, but will a jab at an old memory stop our reporter from completing his mission? Not if Seth Rogan can help it! 

It's a fun movie along the line of Inglorious Bastards. There is a weird running joke about honey potting, but it doesn't take much away from the film. It's wonderfully cast, the cinematography is spot on, and the overly glory, but brief special effects are not over the top, but comfortably resting on the brim. 

There are funny lines, but it really take home the perspective that the North wants people to see itself as. This movie is fairly mild for Western audiences, but if the people of North Korea saw this film, they might just start a revolt as the movie suggests.

This movie deserves a ten and my money just for putting it out there for net release. 

Merry Christmas Sony and everyone else. This is the best present I could ever have...Freedom

If you are the kind of person who thinks that 138 consecutive gay dick jokes or references told on an 8-year-old's poop joke level of intellectual humor might be funny, then this movie is probably a sidebuster. Otherwise it is pretty lame. Other than the Eminem cameo and the tiger scene, there was little to laugh about. The few funny scenes scattered throughout the movie are not really worth the sit-through. 

The magic that Rogen and Franco may have had in movies like Pineapple Express is diminished. Or maybe I just didn't have enough weed to sit through this and actually enjoy it. No, weed probably won't help with this one. 

This is more of a have-to-see-because-everyone-else-is-talking-about-it kind of movie. Don't expect too many laughs.

It is little wonder there were threats over the release of this piece of garbage.I think Mr. Obama would have the exact same reaction if it was about him and he too would have teams of hackers shut it down. I enjoy this genre of film. However this one makes Scary Movie 4 look like Gone with the Wind. Unlike American Carol and Team America which were creative, humerus and well scripted, this movie comes across as if written on a cocktail napkin after 12 beers and 6 shots of tequila by horny adolescents. There is no redeeming value anywhere in the film. The script is awful, the story line is boring and predictable. How many times are we to be subjected to multiple 'boners' as the funny parts of a film. I like my crazy movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadaver and the Evil Dead trilogy. The only redeeming feature of the movie is that it will be quickly forgotten. What a waste of 112 minutes and five bucks..

I don't understand some of the critics of this site. 99% of them do not know comedy at all. I had to be married to any of them, it'd be like being married to a cat with no humor. This movie had many funny parts. It even told you the whole movie in the conference with Agent Lacey at the CIA headquarters (they go through a secret tunnel, Seal Team 6 rescues them and puts them on an inflatable boat). Overall it was a great movie. Critics, you really don't understand what humor is at all. Movies like Neighbors (Released as Bad Neighbours outside of the United States) and This Is The End got very bad reviews yet all still funny. People seriously need to find a sense of humor...

I wasn't expecting much when I watched The Interview, but was pleasantly surprised.

I categorize the movie as an Animal House updated to the present. Yes, the humor is grouse in places just like Animal House was almost 30 years ago and unsuitable for children or prudes.

But everyone else with a sense of humor will really enjoy the movie.

The acting is fine. I understand there are some complaints the N. Koreans are being libeled, but I thought that only applied when what you say isn't true. 

I strongly suggest you go see The Interview.

Mel Brooks said it best. He's the Jewish comedian who wrote The Producers, the movie and Broadway play that features a Hitler impersonator. He said that some topics are so traumatic that they can only be explored through comedy.

In the same way, The Interview takes an important issue of our time and satirizes it without becoming dark. North Korea is essentially a death camp for its millions of citizens, and the main plot focuses on bringing down the dictator a peg or two.

To my delight, I not only laughed out loud, but had prolonged laughter where I could not believe what was happening on the screen. The film is not just a satire, it is genuinely funny. 

You have to expect a certain kind of comedy from Seth Rogen: it's enormously intelligent, yet also full of dick jokes. That contradiction is resolved through the personalities of two best friends, ignoble interviewers, who get the chance to visit North Korea, and then are approached by the CIA to do something noble.

There could have been more foreshadowing in the film, for example in the romance subplot and in a build-up to the climax, but otherwise was excellent. The starvation of the North Koreans is satirized but without a dark scene showing the misery, keeping it a comedy. The mission to kill off Kim Jung Il goes awry immediately and the film heads into territory that you will not expect.

It would have been easy to make this a fictional dictator, but keeping it real makes the film relevant and even important. Too many people turn their eyes away from this important topic. Not only is a comedy the best way to discuss such the horrors of totalitarianism in a mainstream way, it may be the only way.

The movie had the right mixture of emotion and with its signature style of having a sad music on its supposed to be energetic climax created an outstanding effect. It also promotes viewers of realizing and acceptance in their Identities just like the "This is the end" movie with the same directors. For me it can revolutionize the film industry especially to the films under comedic genres. It has the usual comedic twists an plots. The usual comedic over-reaction is in perfect timing. The difference of this movie to other comedy movies is the "lows" of the movie that gives emphasis on its "highs". It is cute. The movie inspires me somehow. Good original style. Excellent actors. Excellent storyline. The movie makes perfect sense to me.

From start to finish this film is witty fresh and original. The chemistry between Franco and Rogan was fluid as ever, leading to a light and easily digestible comedy leaving me wanting for more. 

There are five or six scenes that could make this one an all time classic, which I think could happen with the Adam Sandler flick blended from this year as well as this is the end. But this one is in a whole different league from both of those because it pushes new boundaries and explores new topics which most others have been scared to reach. 

Many quotable lines come back to mind such as honeydicked and in America we call it Stallone. About 100 others that will more than likely make its way into everyday language and slang. 

The political slants and angles were not over the top and not in any way in my opinion too unfair or politically incorrect. Both sides of the story were presented with facts to let the viewer decide. A process of self discovery occurred for both the viewer and for Franco which made it an intellectual journey. 

I Am not a cult follower of Rogan but enjoyed this film highly and hope for its success. Almost as good as team America :)

I just happened to see Dumb and Dumberer the same night. I thought they were on the same level. Both of them were a wast of my time only reason I was able finish them was I was at work and they were playing in the background. I have a feeling people are artificially voting this movie up due to all the media attention surrounding this movie. If this movie were released under normal circumstances it probably would have flopped in the box offices. I image it would've gotten between a 5 or 6 in terms of IMDb ratings. Don't bother paying to watch this.

I don't normally write reviews but I feel like I was mislead by the reviews for this particular movie. When I went to watch the film it was rated 9.1.
