### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
"Kubo and the Two Strings" is a hard movie to explain. There is a story in it and the adventure is grand and fun, but I can't place it into a category of traditional storytelling. The themes of the film are the values of memories and how we truly can never forget people that we lose throughout our lifetime. Very mature themes that are handled with such finesse and creativity that I can't say I have seen anything like it before. Even when you as the audience know where the story is headed, the film surprises you with the delivery and you actually grow and learn with the characters. 

The strength of the film is the pure visceral experience it provides. The visuals and sound had a layer of depth and drama that you feel in your inner core. It is more of an experience than it is a movie that you watch. Throughout the film, I felt moments of sadness, loss, happiness, horror, fear, and accomplishment. It is a movie that truly raises the bar for animation and it saddens me that many people will not check it out as it is very different from traditional animated films that we are used to seeing from other major animation studios. 

So much care and attention went into this film. The world Laika has created is rich with so much history, story, mythos, and culture that even some movies and series that are much longer can't fully create. I felt that the world is living and that magic is truly alive. I love how the character make it feel special that magic exists, but aren't put of by it, when they see it for themselves and have to question the logic.

The characters are fun and lovable, but also brave and dimensional. Not one character felt out of place and they're inclusion felt important. The voice casting is top-notch and I felt like the celebrities actually made an effort. Unlike many big-budget animated productions, The voice actors weren't distracting and added their own layer of charisma that enhanced and drew attention to the characters. Monkey is probably the best character and I feel like she'll be the fan favorite as she's funny, powerful, and a total bada**.

Overall, Laika has produced probably their best animated film to date and that is saying a lot from a studio that produces quality efforts time and time again. "Kubo and the Two Strings" is unlike anything out there and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The animation alone is breathtakingly gorgeous. The beautiful score and music only adds to the complexity of the film. It is probably the best film of 2016 so far and I find it hard to beat. I highly recommend that people check out this highly creative experience.

Kubo and the Two Strings might be one of the best movies I've seen all year. In a crowded year of comic book movies, sequels, and remakes, that's probably not saying much. I wanted to be fair though and look at those movies with an open mind and a little background on their franchises for what each movie wanted to accomplish. However I've been waiting for so long to see something fresh, original, and holy cow this was it. Kubo is a stop motion animated film by Laika studios who've produced Coraline, Paranorman, and the Box Trolls. I really enjoyed Coraline and didn't really like Paranorman or the Box Trolls so I had no idea what to expect from this movie. My friend and I went opening night because the trailers looked interesting, and we were into the entire run time. It's so beautifully shot, the story is simple yet engaging, and the action is just amazing to behold. I don't want to give away anything about the story because I went into this movie blind not knowing that much and I think people should try to do the same. It's surprisingly also very funny! My friend and I just looked at each other shocked at how much this movie made us laugh. The characters are great and the voice work is very impressive. Everything about this movie is just so impressive. For little kids maybe it's not something to hold their interest, but older kids and adults I think should seriously consider checking this out. It's a fun, well written, and very emotional story. Not only should this movie win best animated feature so far, it should be nominated for best picture I'm serious! Lovers of film, animation, storytelling. PLEASEEEE go out and support this movie I heard it will have a low opening weekend and it's such a shame. We need to make this film a hit I want more animated movies of this quality, check it out!

Attended a pre-opening screening of Laika's stop motion animated movie "Kubo and the Two Strings" yesterday and I have to say I totally loved it! The story is set in ancient Japan, where a young boy named Kubo cares for his ailing mother in a seaside Japanese village. He is a beloved storyteller who plays a magical shamisen (Japanese 3-string instrument). A spirit from the past turns Kubo's life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. In order to survive, he sets out on a quest to locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior. He makes friends and allies, encounters monsters and evil demons, and learns important lessons along the way. Visually, this is epically incredible and a game changer for stop motion. The action and excitement kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn't recommend it for really small children, though. There are times it's scary and the monsters are very well done! There's an excellent moral to the story and delightful humor, so children and adults will both enjoy it. Well done Laika. Best one yet!

I am a pretty big fan of Laika. As a studio, they have brought a blend of stop-motion and CGI into the mainstream and have also tested much riskier subject material than other animation companies. Not only is their animation time consuming and risky, but their ideas are fairly risky as well (in today's market, that is).

And Kubo is another interesting premise with beautiful animation, gorgeous backgrounds, and a nice style to it. It looks really good. Props to the animators. Stop-motion is advancing further and further with every movie Laika is making, and the stuff that is done in this movie would have seemed impossible to do only 7 years ago when Coraline was first released.

The first 20 minutes of this movie are excellent and well-told!

However, beautiful animation does not make a good movie...

Story is the heart of a movie, and if you don't know how to tell a story, then you should go back to the drawing board (or storyboard). The biggest issue with Kubo isn't the most obvious one. The characters are nice, the animation is nice, the action is nice, and everything feels pretty solid, but what really kills this movie is the editing, the script, and its lack of solidity. 

In short: Kubo and the Two Strings doesn't know what it is.

I could write a 10 page essay on the deeper issues of this movie, but that doesn't fit in one IMDb review. In Kubo, and lot of interesting ideas are brought up, but none of them fit together or are cohesive. 

For example, what is Kubo's motivation? Staying alive? Saving his mom? Beating his grandpa? Kubo never really gets true motivation until the third act and this is a major issue for the movie. The movie says Kubo is on an adventure, but he doesn't seem to feel the stakes until the final act, which is way too late in the game for us to care about him.

The same goes with the villain. The background and motives of the villain are constantly changing and inconsistent. One second he wants to kill Kubo. Next second he wants his eye. Yet another second later, he just wants to help Kubo come to heaven with him. Then he hates everyone becomes they are human. Then his motives change to he just hates human because they could overthrow him. Then another motive where it is because he thinks they are disgrace.

THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.

For the villain's motivation and reasoning to be completely ambiguous and confusing completely ruins Kubo's arc... which is equally confusing and muddled. Essentially, both the villain and the protagonist are the weakest points of this movie. A movie can't really hold together with this big of a problem. 

And this issue is repeated throughout the movie where nothing is actually fully realized. 

For example: there is one scene where Kubo briefly loses control of his powers and it does something he didn't mean to do. Never mentioned again in the movie.

The plot of his mother being sick and needing to be taken care of. Never fully explained or fully realized.

Why the mom can't recognize her own husband when she sees his face? Why does the mom pretend she isn't kubo's mom (she says it is so he won't feel bad?!?!?). How come the mom told stories of the locations of all of the MacGuffins, but then doesn't know where they are?

What did the moon king want with Kubo's eyes? Why does the moon king have Kubo's eye at the end when he is a human, but not when he is a spirit being? Why does the moon king become a human? Why does the town lie about his past? Why did Kubo trust the moon king in the dream, when his whole journey is to beat the moon king, but then when he sees the moon king he trusts him?

*big spoilers* Why is there a red paper samurai? Why is there a red paper samurai once the beetle shows up, who is the actual real-life version of that samurai! Why didn't anyone recognize the beetle as the father, especially when the father's samurai armor appears to be sitting within that same cave? Why didn't anyone follow the red paper samurai to the last location of the armor? They followed it the entire time, but not at the end?

Long story short, this list of character problems and inconsistencies is much longer than this, but a lot of these are pretty big plot problems and not just nit-picks. The finale of the movie is problem the worst element of the movie and not because it isn't visually stunning, but mostly because it is one character who has no tangible motivation versus someone else who hasn't had a very clear goal throughout the film. To make it worse, the movie doesn't even know what it is about. Is it about memories? Is it about death? Is it about stuck-up snobs? Is it an attack on tradition? Is it attacking perfectionists? What is the movie about? 

What makes this all the more frustrating is the fact that ParaNorman is a movie that has a similar premise, but it does it perfectly. The ending of ParaNorman works, because all of its themes tie together flawlessly. 

ParaNorman is a cohesive story and knows what it is saying. Kubo does not.

Sadly, if you are expecting the next Coraline or ParaNorman, then prepare to be disappointed. This movie feels like a first-pass. A lot of ideas, but none of them mesh together or are completed.

You know what I love in Kubo and the Two Strings (among several other things)? It doesn't go out of its way to explain its magic. It simply IS. Oh, sure, there's a talking monkey that saves the lead character Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson, the monkey by Charlize Theron), and there's an explanation briefly (and then a later one, which I won't reveal at all), but it doesn't matter any more than how Kubo can use his guitar strings to make his origami turn into sword-wielding samurai, or how the former bodyguard named Beetle comes to be (Matthew McConaughey going back into his 'McConnaissance' mode as being a truly great performance expanding what we thought he's capable of a semi-comic sidekick).

The filmmakers let the characters explain when they need to, yet when they do it's done in the form of storytelling - at one point when Monkey is finally pressed by Kubo (and Beetle too) to say what is going on with his otherworldly grandfather and his Aunt who is out to, well, kill him and what Monkey has to do with it, she can only tell it as Kubo plays his guitar and the papers for his origami go into the air to show as she tells. This is a film that loves storytelling and storytellers, and yet never forgets that this is a full-bodied CINEMATIC experience.

I can't remember the last time I've recently seen so much imagination and visual invention in one fantastical animated film, stop motion or otherwise (not even Finding Dory, which certainly has both humor and some heartfelt moments, got to that this year). The story involves a little boy, who we are introduced to at the start as being saved/protected by his mother as a baby (with an eye cut out, by his grandfather), that is at the start making money by performing with his flying/magic origami in a village while tending to his mother who seems to be suffering from amnesia (as an aside, I knew I would love this movie about five minutes in when the filmmakers show us what this dynamic between son and mother is as the latter stares off into space with a haunted, sad look as the son tries his best to care for her, all without words, a perfect moment that I'd never expect to see in a kid's film in a multiplex kind of environment).

But Kubo can't be out after dark, the evil sister of his Mother - with a black hat and white mask that makes her creepy past Burton-type standards - attacks, and Kubo is sent away and is knocked out. When he awakes Monkey is there and, soon after on this quest to find items that will help him face his evil Aunt and grandfather, the Beetle guard, and it becomes a hero's journey story. And what a hero and journey! There's a lot of action that the filmmakers pack into this movie - it is a Japanese fantasy-inspired film, so there may be some violent imagery that may scare the wee ones like under four of five, but most kids should be able to take it and, if I remember how I was at that age, love it - and it involves things like a giant skeleton monster that comes to life with swords stuck in its skull (and the three characters have to find which one is their unbreakable one), and, my favorite weird and wonderful creation, a group of underwater eyeballs that, when one looks too long at them, puts the person in a trance leading down to a... well, don't want to give it away.

The voice-work is a delight which, as I said, McConaughey really digs into being a character who is the faithful protector though has some 'off' memory problems at times and a looser way of looking at protecting a child than Monkey (Theron plays the strict motherly figure as good as she's played any role, including Monster or Furiosa), and it becomes this story that's as much about family than it is about revenge or other petty things. You do have to pay attention, this isn't a movie that you can throw on for your kids and they can act crazy or get distracted: it asks that you watch it and take in a story that at its core isn't too far removed from Joseph Campbell, but does so many twists that it becomes its own original entity.

Kubo and the Two Strings gives you all that you could want in a family animated movie, but more than that is a splendid, heart-rending fantasy epic in under 100 minutes. It brings me back to when I first saw something like The Dark Crystal and was amazed at what creators can do when they embrace really creating a WORLD that their characters can inhabit - not to mention keeping any humor to the situations or behavior, nothing that dates it at all. I can't recommend it enough.

Those talented folks at LAIKA have done it again. KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is not just one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. Not since Pixar's "Up," have death and loss been handled do firmly and delicately. "Kubo" is fun, moving, hopeful, and profound. A terrific story of bravery and acceptance.

Written by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler and directed by LAIKA's own president, Travis Knight, KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is set in a fantastical Japan where a one-eyed kid who masters the art of origami and storytelling, Kubo, (voiced by Art Parkinson of "Game Of Thrones") would go out to work to earn money during the day by entertaining audiences in the middle of a market but he comes home right before sundown to tend to his sick mother, it has to be before sundown because at night, his mother's sisters, two evil twins (voice day Oscar nominee Rooney Mara) would try to get Kubo's other eye. The past catches up to them, an old vendetta resurfaces, Kubo must run and join forces with Monkey (voiced by Oscar winner Charlize Theron) and a beetle (voiced by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey) on a quest to retrieve the helmet, the sword unbreakable and the armor that would prepare Kubo to fight the vengeful Moon King (voiced by Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes). This quest would unlock Kubo's family mystery and lead him to fulfill his destiny.

I've always appreciated animation, but with stop-motion, it's extra level of appreciation, knowing the extra hard work they put into even just to get a few seconds of shots. It's a level of dedication and discipline that never ceases to blow my mind, that's why I'm a huge fan of LAIKA. Especially with this latest film of theirs, the scale is much bigger, there's a sequence involving a large skeleton giant, your brain starts to wonder as you see that scene just how many hours, how many weeks, how many months did it take for them to make that happen.

This film has action, it has love drama, it has family drama, it has a great sense of humor and it's also about community coming together to help one another. It has its own way of featuring and respecting Japanese art and tradition, but even if you're not too familiar with that particular culture, KUBO resonates much deeper than just the aesthetics. It's a film that's perfect for the whole family. And on top of that, it delicately teaches our young ones about how to grieve in a healthy manner. There's also a twist to the story which I won't spoil for you here. This film is just so beautiful and pristine. Charlize Theron has that commanding voice you would follow to the ends of the earth. And Matthew McConaughey voices Beetle as playful and as proud as Tim Allen did Buzz Lightyear. So it's a combination of outstanding stop motion animation, excellent voice talents, a well-told story and strong characters that make KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS one of my favorite this year.

I expected big things from Kubo. Those expectations were met on a purely superficial level. The film looks beautiful and the meticulousness of the stop motion craft is clear for all to see, but the story had major problems.

After the striking opening of mother and son caught in a tumultuous storm that dashes them against rocks and washes both ashore, we have a watchable, if slightly dull 20 minutes of exposition and establishing character goals before it quickly devolves into a predictable rehash of the 3 act hero structure. The young, one-eyed, but infinitely resourceful Kubo sets off on a quest to find 3 fabled pieces of armour so he can do battle with his evil grandfather up in the heavens, who just can't stand humans and their silly "feels" (but you know of course that 'feels' are exactly what will triumph in the end (cue eye-roll)).

The ease in which Kubo finds these items in such quick succession doesn't really feel suitably epic and there's no real sense of how far he actually has to travel, he just always conveniently ends up right where he needs to be. There's no real sense of danger either, despite the odious threat of his sinister aunts coming to steal his good eye so they might blind him to humanity, you never once feel like this might actually happen. 

Overall, it felt to me like the writers thought up a bunch of cool set pieces they could throw at the viewer, and then tried to weave a script around those. The 'banter' between Kubo's companions Monkey and Beatle, serves as empty filler between action sequences; Their constant squabbling is over-played and annoying. It also bugged me that despite the lovingly realized visual depiction of ancient Japan, the characters acted and sounded so American.

The menacing twin aunts (voiced by Rooney Mara) and the fantastic origami action were high points and very entertaining. However, mostly I was bored and consciously predicting lazy story arcs. It just wasn't a satisfying experience and it's a shame for Laika to spend so much time and effort crafting animation for a contrived, generic story which failed to deliver any emotional weight.

I love this movie. It is original, beautiful to watch and has heart and soul. The quirkiness of this movie only adds to its lovability. It is hard to find an original movie and using origami as the base of this movie is simply genius.

Kubo's grandfather has stolen his eye and now is after the other and he will do whatever he has to, to get the other eye. His two aunts are frighten witches. His mother has lost all her memories and many dangers await Kubo and his only helpers are a monkey and a silly half man, half beetle and an endless supply of paper. I know this all sounds totally crazy, but it all works together quite nicely to make this incredible movie.

I struggled once trying to make an origami swan so I appreciate the origami in this film which has a mind of its own. Kubo plays a two- stringed instrument which transforms simple paper into magnificent, magical shapes and forms. 

The voice-overs in this film are stupendous and really bring it to life. My favorite character is Kubo (Art Parkinson) who is just so adorable yet strong, independent and goodhearted. My other favorite is Monkey (Charlize Theron) who is brave, funny, clever and very stubborn. I love her character because of all these traits. Even though she is tough, she has a kind, sweet side that she shows how much she loves her son. There is also the beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who is hysterical, dangerous and a straight shooter or, at least according to him he is. I love his character because its funny and had me belly laughing. His affection for Monkey is adorable. Of course, there are villains of this film. The sisters, both played by Rooney Mara portrays them as crazy, wacko witches and her voice is perfectly scary. The other villain, The Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is the weird Grandfather who wants Kubo's other eye and he is super creepy.

One of my favorite scenes is when Kubo, Monkey and Beetle are trying to defeat a giant skeleton and find the sword of unbreakablity. It is adventurous and funny. The graphics are incredible, especially the way they created the skeleton. This is the biggest clay animation character ever made. I thought this action scene was intricate and believable.

I recommend this film for ages 7 to 18. Adults will like it too. I do want to suggest that if your child is younger than 7, they might get scared with the darkness and the villains, but if they can accept that it is all fake then they will be okay. I rate this film 5 out of 5 magical origami stars.

If this film was told from another perspective, Kubo and the Two Strings might be considered a bit preachy. It still might be, regardless. But no matter how you look at it, it is something to be looked at more than once. It is simply an amazing work of animated achievement in cinema.

Set in what could be medieval Japan, a little boy named Kubo scratches out a meager existence on the village streets earning just enough for him and his mother to survive. For her part, mom (voiced by Charlize Theron) sits at the mouth of their mountaintop cave in a comatose state every day until dusk. This is also the time when Kubo must be home, not only to be there when she snaps out of it to regale him with stories of his long lost warrior father, but so he can be safe from the evil that bewitched his mother and left him with only one eye. Failing to do this one fateful night forces Kubo on a journey to recover mythical armor and weapons that will beat back the forces of darkness and restore love and harmony to his life and the lives of others. Aiding him on his quest are a miniature monkey carving come to life, an origami samurai, and a beetle/man warrior (Matthew McConaughey).

What is truly exceptional about Kubo and the Two Strings is not the story. The characters have American English accents and are not Asian. A couple characters aren't really fleshed out (those of Brenda Vaccaro and Ralph Fiennes for example). Although the film is geared toward a younger audience, there are deep themes of rebirth and reincarnation that are a major part of the movie and seem heavy handed, as was hinted at earlier. The story is not the star, the presentation of the story is what shines.

Anyone who is familiar with Laika studios work (Coraline, The Boxtrolls) will not be disappointed in how Kubo and the Two Strings looks. For the uninitiated, be prepared to see a film that hearkens back to the old style of painstaking, stop-motion animation with a splash of 21st century wizardry. These filmmakers have done what other strive to do with budgets two, four, even six times larger. They have made an animated world that pulls you in with its realism. It doesn't come off as cartoon like. Eyes glisten, teeth are almost translucent, hair blows in the wind, characters have shadows. Any shortcomings in the script are quickly forgiven when the evil sisters float into the scene or when Kubo (Art Parkinson) captivates the town folk with his storytelling. It's the attention to detail, the craftsmanship, and artistic appreciation that sets films like Kubo and the Two Strings apart from other animated feature films. The filmmakers have learned a lot from the old masters and have served notice that they are at the top of their game. Just sit back and let them and their latest undertaking work their magic on you.

Can someone please tell me what this film was about? The visuals were great and the actors also but the end of the movie had me scratching my head. It left me feeling ultimately unfulfilled. How is it that the evil and all powerful grandfather turns into a meek half blind feeble old man with no memory? Where did his 2 aunts go? And why were they wearing masks the whole time? Something must have actually happened as his parents did die so this story was not just a fantasy the boy was having about his cranky grandfather. Why did his grandfather remove the boy's eye and want to take the other one too? My friend and I just looked at each other when the film was over, not sure what to think. We had gone through a beautiful adventure, one that ultimately did not make sense to either one of us. Had I known that this film was 99% about art and 1% about plot, I know I would not have gone.

"I know that my stories tend to get a little long". A perfect definition of Kubo about himself and also about his movie.

Instead of showing us a story, Laika decided to tell them through some paper tails that happen during punctual conversations between the characters, who are just walking around through the entire movie. Their long walking is filled with random fights that make no sense and many, many parents (I counted two moms and three dads) because apparently everyone/everything in the world (and beyond it) is related to Kubo. And this boy might be really cursed because every time he finds out someone is one of his parents, the person dies.

In a sea of drama with some forced humour moments, everybody is always about to die until the last second when someone bravely saves them out of nowhere. And then, out of nowhere again, they're laughing and becoming best friends, then in the next second someone is about to die again and we repeat the cycle until they actually die. The writers were just throwing things on us and finding excuses to justify those parallel stories they wanted to tell. The justification for Kubo losing his eye? COME ON!

It is really obvious that they put way more effort into the visuals than in the story, as the characters are beautiful but really empty and senseless. The problem is that even visuals tell stories and if you have nothing to tell, the designs and backgrounds might look beautiful but they will be really blend and generic, nothing really pops up in that world, there's nothing singular about it.

The movie is called Kubo and the Two Strings and I still don't know what that instrument is and why it gives him powers or what the heck his powers are and what exactly is his mom or his dad or something And what's their deal with death anyway? I know they wanted to show a different vision of death and mourning, but it's used in a way and intensity that seems like they are obsessed about it.

I was really stoked to watch this movie, but I'm really disappointed now. Sorry if it seems harsh, but it's just how I feel about it...

Reviewers Notes; 

1. As I write this, the top-rated IMDb review starts with the header "a hard movie to explain..." and that pretty much nails it. The film starts very slow, builds gradually, has the viewer hooked like a fish by the mid-point, and then falls a tiny bit short in the climax. But overall the experience is unforgettable, magical, and great fun.

2. In Japan anime, they revere not only their movies but their studios. It was always considered that the NA studios, even Pixar, don't measure up. But Studio Laiko in this amazing film has done things with stop-motion and color which make it a world standard and as good as or better than the best that Japan has to offer. I am even going to use some frames a screen saver, they are THAT good.

3. Lots of great voice acting but Charlize Theron steals, literally steals, the film and takes it to a new level. Makes you forget all about the goldfish that initially started the trend in "star" voices. Truly an incredible performance.

Young Kubo (Art Parkinson) lives a simple life on a small island village. At night, he cares for his frail mother, who suffers from bouts of amnesia. But during the day, Kubo fervently entertains the townsfolk with music, magical origami, and fantastical tales of heroic samurai on treacherous crusades. One evening, while Kubo participates in a customary ritual to receive guidance from his departed father's spirit, he inadvertently ignores his mother's warnings not to stay out past nightfall and is accosted by two powerful witches (both voiced by Rooney Mara). His mother comes to his aid, but must sacrifice herself to allow him to escape. Awakening in a snowstorm with a strange monkey (Charlize Theron) as his only friend, Kubo must embark on a quest of discovery just as mystical and perilous as those he once told.

"Pay careful attention to everything you may see or hear." There's something striking about the choice repetitions of significant lines, and something reservedly powerful about the opening moments, featuring a mother who bares physical scars to match those of her son. And the use of a diminutive storyteller to narrate and shape his own skein of adventure and tragedy is particularly inspiring, especially as he bravely confronts the heartbreak of tending to the gaps in memory and the spells of stupor that overtake his mother's normalcy. It's all part of the groundwork for a mesmerizing odyssey.

Masterfully blending together Oriental high fantasy (or a romanticization of Japanese feudal military aristocracy), Greek mythology, and an Americanized viewpoint on action and heroism, "Kubo and the Two Strings" is seemingly anachronistic in its cultural suggestions and verbiage (though nevertheless sharply scripted) as it sets about constructing an epic expedition through an orphic land. Despite resorting to formulaic processes for its protagonists, for the great evils that target them, and for the supernatural heraldry that protects them, few moments can be directly compared to any other animated picture. The witches are perfectly diabolical - and entirely uncommon for a family-friendly venture - while a bone golem, a paper samurai, and a boat of leaves are each wholly original manifestations. The artistry on display is of the extremely imaginative, highly visual kind, creating a notable style for its world that Laika Entertainment appears to have cornered (predominantly in its use of stop-motion animation and massive armatures, previously employed for "Coraline" and "Corpse Bride," among others).

The plot tends to wander in the middle of the film as the basic components of a grand adventure weigh on the uniqueness of the individual missions, which occasionally fail to transition or relate to the overarching concepts as smoothly as the should. Similarly, the editing together of a few scenes is abrupt, as if segues was cut out for time. But it does succeed handsomely at the start. Setting a tone and introducing characters are efficiently handled tasks, but steadily incorporating the magical elements is done superbly. By the time the talking monkey shows up, it never once feels out of place. The possessed folded paper, the phantasmal music, and the winning expressions on strangely palpable faces are all natural, amusing pieces of this vivid trek of continual wonderment and excitement.

(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) 
THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  
IN BRIEF: An animated film brimming with stunning visuals. 
GRADE: B+ 
SYNOPSIS: A young boy goes on a quest to find a magic helmet and armor  to protect himself and others from evil forces. 
JIM'S REVIEW: Laika Studios (Coraline. ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls) has  long been pioneers in stop-motion animation, a time-consuming and  difficult art form. This studio has always set a high bar in terms of  animation, although its storytelling never quite equal that pinnacle of  success. With Kubo and the Two Strings, it has finally combined the two  and has created a joyous and totally satisfying film experience. 
￼Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a master storyteller who charms the villagers  with his imaginative tales and origami skills. As his stories unfold,  literally, so does this film. Colorful sheets of handmade papers glide  through the air and form various objects in such graceful and  enthralling ways, animation-wise. We learn of his story, of his past  life, and the dangers that await in his future. We meet Kubo and begin  his journey with new comrades like Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle  (Matthew McConaughey) as they travel from one peril to the next. 
￼The screenplay by Mark Haimes and Chris Butler has an epic feel and  keeps the action sequences moving at a fast pace after a leisure  beginning as its sets up its character and the interrelationships of  this trio of adventurers. The direction by Travis Knight is impeccable.  He envisions surreal worlds that are masterful created by him and his  creative team. In general, the voice-over work is strong and appealing  too, especially by Ms. Theron, Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King, and  Master Parkinson in the title role. There is also fine work from George  Takei, Brenda Vacarro, and Rooney Mara in smaller roles. However, Mr.  McConaughey's vocals never quite blend with his character, but, in his  defense, the character needed better development on the written page  and in its animated form. 
￼At times, the words sound like second-rate bromides from a fortune  cookie factory, but the imagery is consistently outstanding and awesome  to behold. There is so much artistry that it overwhelms...in the best  of ways. A magical sword cuts waves in two...a large red skeleton looms  over its prey...black smoke bellows around a village, enveloping it...a  sea of glowing eyes fills its watery surroundings...blue paper-folded  birds fly with their real counterparts before rapidly converting into  mosquitoes...golden leaves float effortlessly and create a ship of  wonders. (One long and memorable sequence involving a fluorescent  metallic serpent is spectacular state-of-the-art animation.)  
￼Beside the remarkable stop motion work, special mention must go to  Dario Marinelli and his musical score which melds perfectly with the  imagery on screen. His use of atonal chords and dissonance reflect the  Japanese sounds beautifully and enhance the overall impact of the film. 
There are some minor, very minor. missteps along the way (Mr.  McConaughey disappoints whenever his Southern drawl slips in and out of  character, most jarringly, the spiritual symbolism of the narrative  gets heavy-handed, and the dialogue has a modern edginess that  conflicts with this ancient narrative story-line). 
￼That said, Kubo and the Two Strings, is easily one of the best  animated films this year...and one of the best films as well. Bravo,  Kubo!

So I watched Kubo, which has absolutely nothing to do with Bleach and thus has no Bankais. I didn't find it bad as I found it empty. Nothing much happens to keep you engaged, and this comes from someone who is not part of the smartphone generation. My attention span is much higher than 5 seconds and I still had the urge to skip forward or multitask for half of the movie.

Every scene plays out in a very basic way, which seems fine when you describe it, but is otherwise not excusing the duration or the scope of the story. On paper you have deities invading from the moon and want to stop a boy and its animal companions from gathering the pieces of an armor that can rival their king. And they travel through stormy seas and caves full of undead, while fighting flying kung-fu witches. Sounds amazing but when you actually see it, it's like ah, is that all? I otherwise like the themes in the story. The conflict is mostly internal, characters are fleshed out on a basic level, and the stop-motion they used looks amazing. None of that excuse a movie's worth of duration. You almost never see more than 3 characters on screen, and whatever they are doing is not keeping you engaged. The world felt like it was just one village and random monster encounters. It never felt like it was bursting with life.

I didn't even like the battles. They look spectacular for a few seconds but they otherwise don't have any actual flow or strategy in them. And I have to point this out; last moment saves are abundant. You can count a dozen times when Kubo is in danger and someone jumps out of nowhere to save him. It's full of fake tension which makes you not believe the characters are in any actual danger.

I don't even think most of the battles and the adventure were significant in the longrun. Kubo went through all this mess just to do something he already knew about all along. He didn't learn it, he hadn't forgotten it, he didn't even have to realize it. It was always there. Getting the armor meant nothing in the end because it still came down to the power of friendship. Which he used in the village the story begins in. Which means he didn't need to go on a journey, he could have simply stayed there and used the damn power since the very beginning. What was the point of the adventure? And I am not done with the complaints, I didn't even like how fast Kubo trusted those animals. He didn't grow up with them, they were not his friends, they were strangers who appeared out of nowhere and insisted they have to help him. Which they do. Over a dozen times. With cheap last moment saves. My point is, there is not much chemistry amongst the major characters. They are unfamiliar to each other, thus they feel more like plot devises so Kubo can have someone to talk with, or to save his ass from every monster he encounters. And yes, by the end of the film you learn those animals are not really strangers to him, but it's only because the bad guys were infodumping in the middle of the battle and not because the animals revealed it themselves.

Furthermore, we have zero characterization for the bad guys. We know nothing about them besides being evil and supposed living on the moon. We don't even see the moon. We never seem them outside the scenes they are attacking Kubo, which makes you not care about them. Two of them go as far as wearing masks so they can look even more inhuman, and the third which has a face eventually mutates into an ugly monster which you would want to see dead. So lazy! So basically, the creators focused only on the moral message and the stop motion, while doing very little for excusing a whole movie about them. And although I understand this is basically aimed at kids, the ending was anti-climactic. It made a dull adventure no kid will be paying attention to (because they will be playing with their smartphones) feeling pointless because it came down to the souls of the dead coming to save the protagonist with the power of friendship because he was really passionate while playing the lute. Boring!

This is a well animated film, the kid does have a punchable face though overall good, the music is pretty good too, McConaughey also OK, that's not enough to elevate this beyond an average kids film.

The plot is simple and very very formulaic I don't mind this too much it's something I can forgive entirely but so much about this film rubbed me the wrong way, I found the characters annoying and corny, the jokes were mostly not funny and the dialogue was cringey. The sappy ending were he defeats his grandfather in centipede form with a cheesy monologue and guitar strum made me want to puke. I'm surprised by the critical acclaim, outside of the few positives I mentioned you are not left with much. It's not terrible, OK for kids I suppose but I could think of a dozen better family films certainly not up there with the best

- The animation is very well-done, but the character and environment designs are uninspired.

- Despite marketing focusing on Kubo's ability to animate origami figures, he RARELY uses this ability. It's RIDICULOUS. You expect that the film would carry some semblance of him getting more experienced at using his powers for things other than storytelling, but they all but disappear after the first act of the story. 

- Despite the focus on Kubo's shamisen, the soundtrack of the film is very ordinary and unmemorable. It sounds like every other mediocre American film for the most part, when you would expect Japanese influence, especially in the form of... oh, I don't know, a SHAMISEN?

- Action scenes are somehow dull. It's tough to describe, but they lack energy or the feeling of peril and there are a lot of "saved at the last minute" moments. Like, multiple per fight scene. The main characters fight a giant skeleton and it just feels... boring. The fight takes place within a very closed space, which makes the monster look small instead of imposing. The characters don't really use any strategy in the fight, they just seem to let the plot take hold and follow a series of random actions.

- Voice acting is alright. I liked Charlize Theron as the strong, but motherly figure, but nobody else stood out and Matthew McConaughey feels horribly miscast. The lack of Japanese actors wouldn't bother me so much, if not for the fact that someone seemed to feel obligated to shove them in somewhere, resulting in George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and a few other Japanese-American actors playing extremely small roles who very well could've been played by anyone. 

- The humour is very clumsy. There are a few times when a joke lands, but most of the time, they're just taking up time that should've been used to expand a character, explain a plot element or enhance the mood of the story. 

- Despite being set in ancient Japan, the Japanese influence is barely tangible. For example: Kubo's father was apparently a samurai, but there's nothing indicating this beyond his armour and the fact that characters say he was. Nothing about the society at the time is really exemplified - the movie could be set pretty much ANYWHERE if names and some aesthetics were changed. Also, despite being an adventure, the world the story takes place in feels impossibly small in a way I rarely experience with a film. 

- Kubo is not an interesting hero, he does not get much character, and never seems particularly motivated by anything other than an insistence by other characters (namely his mother / the monkey) that he HAS to be on this journey. The film (especially near the end) tries to play to the audience's emotions but it does not express enough genuine emotion itself. Also, irritatingly, his whole journey doesn't really reward him with anything, and he doesn't really change because of it. It never felt like he NEEDED to go on it to learn a lesson or gain experience or ANYTHING except that without it there wouldn't be a movie.

- The villains were uninteresting as their motivations are mostly unclear, and stupid. Like... Kubo's grandfather wants to take his eyes and make him live on the moon with him in order to have him not experience the cruelty of life, but... why does he need to take his eyes? It's oddly convoluted and mixes metaphor and literal actions in a way that will just make you question the plot and if anyone decided to even edit the thing. 

- I have patience in SPADES when the subject is interesting, but Kubo's story is incredibly clichéd, predictable and boring. I felt like I was constantly waiting for the plot to pick up and for things to be explained or implied, and being ultimately unsatisfied. It was a very shallow plot with shallow characters. Overall, the plot feels like a bunch of half-baked ideas stitched together. They work as separate concepts, but altogether they don't relate to or complement each other, or give explanation, or often even make sense. Why was Kubo's father turned into a giant beetle rather than killed or turned into something less threatening like... a small beetle? Why is Kubo's mother so sick or mentally scarred in the beginning, but only sometimes? Don't ask questions. Clearly the writers didn't. (Many other users have left reviews pointing out minor, but ultimately compounding questions they had about the story. It's almost shocking how much of the plot is logically inconsistent.) There are twists in the film, but if you're remotely familiar with movies in general, you'll probably figure them out at least 40 minutes before they're revealed.

I can go on. There's a lot wrong with the movie, but overall, it can be encapsulated with "boring and predictable, yet somehow a bit confusing". Clearly some people enjoy it, but I just found it disappointing. Some people might find the animation worth the watch, but while impressive, I didn't find it particularly visually interesting.

Instead I'd recommend watching a Studio Ghibli fantasy film, such as Spirited Away or The Tale of Princess Kaguya. If you're into video games, play Okami. All of these take Japanese mythological ideas and work them into much more entertaining results, even if you aren't incredibly familiar with the source material. If you're looking for stop-motion animation, I'd greatly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Laika's previous exploits of Coraline and Paranorman.

In one of the most "meta" cinematic confessions of the last years since Kylo Ren being embarrassed by his inability to live up to Darth Vader in Episode VII, young wizard/storyteller Kubo (Art Parkinson), the titular protagonist here, sheepishly admits he isn't very good with endings.

This stop-motion fantasy adventure has many successful elements: likable characters, strong voice acting (Charlize Theron in particular is great as a talking animal companion), enough original spins to make the classic hero's journey feel fresh ... and it looks phenomenal. Kubo bristles with visual details - it's one of the most gorgeous animated movies I've watched in years.

Spoilers aside, Kubo starts with an effective first act, builds up to a powerful crescendo... then sort of peters out at the end. Characters we've grown attached to get kicked off the spotlight by the main villain, who had been conspicuously absent until then. It's not a *bad* conclusion - it has a nice bittersweet flavor - but it's anticlimactic.

Overall, Laika's winning streak continues. Much like Coraline, however, this isn't fit for younger children - if you want a fine stop-motion adventure for little kids, go for the Shaun the Sheep movie.

It's a half assed western style remake which takes everything from the east without any respect.

Initially I had high hopes, but this movie betrays its origins on such a deep level. If you're not a real fan of anime or Asian movies (esp. Japan) you will not be disappointed, as Kubo takes you on a visually stunning ride with two mildly interesting characters. If you are a real fan, you will know what I'm talking about.

Depth or character development don't even come close to what this movie could be. This is just a superficial, slow paced where it should be fast, fast where it should be slow, abruptly-ended and the worst ending battle in modern history.

Stop-Motion animation can be a thing of pure beauty. I've been a fan of Laika's previous films (particularly Coraline and ParaNorman to a great extent), and so I really was excited for this. Based on the trailers, it looked like a dazzling experience and I was sure that it would not fail to meet expectations. I was right. There's a real sense of artistry to the film that is missing in a lot of other kids' animated films. It's about family, the power of memory, and longing, and it manages to create some truly memorable, fantastic villains that happen to be both well-written and really terrifying. More than anything, the themes at its core really resonate. This may likely be the best animated film of the year.

Really disappointed. While the movie excels in visuals and animation department, it is let down by the weak writing/story. The dialogues have no impact, the conversations between monkey and the Beetle could have been so good, and it TRIES so hard to be funny and yet falls flat. They are just, naive. That's the best word to describe them. Naive. Immature. They seem to have been written by a 12 year old. 

The story is ambiguous. It's a fight between good and evil yet it doesn't take one definite theme. What is the Evil after? What does the good stand for in this particular instance? It seems all the resources for the movie were spent on the animation with little to spare for the story and dialogues. The worst thing is its a little too mature for kids, yet not enough to engage an adult. So much potential, wasted.

After hearing a lot of buzz about "Kubo," I had high hopes for this movie. Ultimately though, it's a very mediocre film that never delivers anything satisfying unless you're just in it for the spectacle. All the massive hype for this film left me hugely disappointed, so I put some thought into what went wrong with the story & the characters.

It feels like they took 15 scripts and hastily patched them together in one afternoon. The central concept is that Kubo has magic powers to bring origami figures to life, but the movie COMPLETELY forgets this by the third act and it never comes up again. When the movie forgets its basic plot hook, you know the script is a colossal mess.

There are lots of half-baked ideas that go absolutely nowhere: Kubo has an old lady friend who quickly disappears and never does anything important. He hears that his village has burned down (for all he knows, killing everyone he's ever known), but in the next scene he's laughing and cheerful like nothing happened. The villain has no coherent goal. The dialogue consists of clichés, followed by lousy comic relief, followed by characters tediously monologuing like they're trying to put you to sleep. Even though it hits you over the head with these monologues, the movie fails to convey any actual message or point!

The plot is borderline nonexistent, so the characters should be the backbone of the film. Let's look at the cast! Kubo himself has as much personality as a sheet of cardboard. He had no clear motive at any point; you never relate to him or care about him. He just muddled through the story like a gutless blank slate.

He's helped on his journey by a monkey, who is the worst "sassy sidekick" I've ever seen. She just sounds surly and petulant most of the time; I guess it's supposed to be funny, but it's only annoying. Her voicework is horribly directed. When she doesn't sound whiny, she blandly recites lines in a stilted, melodramatic way. There's a plot twist that's supposed to make her more relatable, but it just comes across as cheesy melodrama & adds nothing to the story. The script claims that she has a meaningful relationship with Kubo, but the characters never clicked or showed chemistry.

Kubo is also joined by a comical & jolly samurai, who is easily the only likable character in the film. He's lively, he's upbeat, and we actually SEE him form a friendship with Kubo. He never builds any real depth though; there were many chances to show a more serious or grim side under his cheerful exterior, but he stays a 2-dimensional goofball. When that's the best part of the story, it doesn't bode well.

Due to the flat characters and nonexistent storyline, there was no tension whatsoever in the film. There were incredibly bland action scenes, but there was no sense of stakes or risk. For instance, this movie features a giant skeleton monster and manages to make him look harmless and boring, slooowwwwly shuffling along like he's half- asleep. There are no thrills, no excitement, no heart. You can tell people put a lot of hours and money into the film, but absolutely no sincerity or sense of purpose.

That's a lot of words, but I walked out of this movie very disappointed and wanted to give a clear reason why. Overall, "Kubo" is a mediocre popcorn flick. The technical animation quality is good, but it's a big- budget Hollywood production so that's no impressive achievement. Many people will be easily-impressed by the big-budget effects, but if you want a film with an actual story, decent characters, heart, competent voice directing, and/or a POINT, you will miss absolutely nothing if you skip "Kubo".

I pushed myself hard to finish watching this movie and finally watched it with a break. The main reason behind this is the bad story telling technique. The plot is not defined and the story failed to hold my interest. There are much unnecessary dialogue and scenes which don't add any value to the story. The most important thing is that the protagonist is out for its quest which is also not defined. I felt no empathy for the protagonist. Not a single character in this movie is well developed. There is no background story for them. Thus the purpose of the characters is unknown. As a viewer, I did not connect with the characters at all. The ending is also vague, and I doubt if kids will understand it at all. There is nothing good about the story. The animators did a fair job, and the animation could have been better (keeping ParaNorman 2012 as a benchmark)

This film hit a sweet spot for me. 

It merges essential Shintoism, magic and origami in a story about storytelling, four subjects of deep interest for me. This is orgasmic level engagement, this mix. I need to see it again in 3D to see if it improves. This would have been the very rare modern film actually photographed in 3D.

Some other elements could have distracted: the very western idea of a quest gives enough script to fill the time. The style of animation has bodies and motion more realistic than faces; in another context this would matter but here we are in a paper world. The use of traditional Japanese villains and characters from myths requires knowledge even I lacked. The style of animation requires a relatively stationary camera which seems inadequate, even in a Japanese context.

The writing is superb, surpassing Pixar and achieving a level completely unexpected. This is true in lines: "blink now;" in the way things unfold unexpectedly and in the nesting of stories. Oh, the overlapping nesting! We have stories within that tell enclosing stories. We have recalled and invented stories cogenerating. The main combat is between/among stories. Memory and stories are bound in an unusual way. So many events unfold in novel ways. 

This is all the more impressive when you consider the inflexible manner of production. You cannot iterate and reshoot like you can with computers or eve actors. What you see is largely what they started with years before even they saw it. If just for the writing, see this movie.

The effects were interestingly different, and by themselves would perhaps have underwhelmed. But the story context by the time things got active added enough. Effects early in the movie have magically folded characters animated by the stories within the story and these were amazing.

I am not seeing many films these days, so it is profound luck that my 3 and 5 year olds took me into this.

And... the credits roll over the George Harrison song that very few understand in its role in the White Album. Here it isn't just used with this knowledge, it is rendered so by a woman I never heard of.

Reading this film was supposed to be "a new animated classic", I truly hoped for a different experience - imaginative, mind stimulating and heart filling, as some of the classics truly are. However, ,this film, that claims to present a child-storyteller as a protagonist, fails a colossal failure in its storytelling above anything else. It could be a good match for those who visit the cinema for the visual thrill only (if there can be any such creature??), but those who wish to find a soulful plot, clever dialogue and inspiring characters are about to have an ailing time, which will induce serious wondering about all the forces who collaborated to make this film happen, not noticing how corny, lifeless and utterly tedious is the script, and eventually the actual film, despite the "action scenes", which are aimed to blur the film's emptiness and fool us that something important is happening. Alas, no such thing is happening, let me assure you. Better pick up your copy of Spirited Away and avoid this film, which only gives American animation a hard blow in the gut. My suggestion to the makers - dub it anew, with a convincing, well thought-of script, and then, maybe, it could be saved. Another option is to watch it mute. Till then, do your soul a favor, and keep your distance.
