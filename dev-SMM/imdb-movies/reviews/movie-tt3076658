### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
There's no other way to say it; Creed is a knockout. 

From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. It wholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the characters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's the characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me from start to finish. 

I can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The way he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the visceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you hit the ground is second to none. What stood out the most, however, was his writing of Rocky Balboa. The subtle nuances that we love about the Italian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like water from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to tears at various parts of this film. 

I'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment. This film exceeded my wildest hopes of a 7th Rocky installment and had me feeling amped up for hours after the credits rolled. I can't wait to see more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse and recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike.

History has a strange way of repeating itself. 40 years ago, Rocky Balboa became a household name and turned an unwanted actor into one of the greatest success stories in Hollywood. The fact that Rocky (1976) won three Academy Awards including Best Picture is of little importance compared to the real life struggle behind the making of that film. For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no- holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more.

Co-written by director Ryan Coogler, there's no doubt that Creed is a passionate love letter to the first film, which in itself is a poetic love story about fighting the good fight. Although boxing is the central theme, and often frowned upon as a brutal blood-sport that causes serious injuries, it's never been about the fight but more about what you are fighting for. Coogler gets this spot-on when we are introduced to teenager Adonis Johnson in juvenile detention. We soon learn that Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, born shortly after the latter's death in Rocky IV. Appolo's widow Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad) rescues young Adonis from what is certain to be a life on the streets and raises him as her own in the plush Creed estate in Los Angeles. Cut to present day and Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is a corporate executive half way up the ladder. It's a stark contrast to Stallone's blue collar stiff in the first film, but this is where both films converge. Like Rocky, Adonis (calling himself Donnie) knows he is destined for something else, so heads to Philadelphia to meet his late father's rival turned best friend.

The meeting with Rocky is one of several great moments in the film while also serving as a nostalgic homecoming occasion for every fan of the franchise. It's a fascinating intersection of the past but none better than the fact that in many ways, Creed is an inverted mirror image of Rocky. And before sending this film off on its own pulsating trajectory, Coogler reveals a full hand of spades. One of which is the legacy Rocky bestows on Donnie, and in essence, Stallone handing over the franchise baton to Jordan. We may not realize this at first and that's because we are already smitten by the father-son relationship developing between Donnie and Rocky. Their character study is the most significant aspect of this film. Donnie has always been an orphan and the reason why he never took on his father's name is an emotional revelation. Who he is and why he wants to become a professional boxer is his darkest secret.

Both equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. Stallone in particular gives what has to be his career best performance since Copland, and if this is his franchise swan song (owing to a devastating but befitting plot device) that's all the more reason why this film must be seen. But as they say, the show must go on and Jordan is more than capable of shouldering future films under the Creed banner. And with the inclusion of Philly local Bianca (Tessa Thompson), Donnie's neighbor and love interest, future sequels look to be set in Rocky's beloved hometown.

Onto the production quality and it suffices to say that Creed has THE best technical aspects in the franchise, including spectacular fight choreography, astounding cinematography in the ring and around Philadelphia, and an upbeat hip-hop soundtrack fused with the original score from previous films. The only real letdown comes from Donnie's main opponent (Real life professional boxer Tony Bellew) who isn't as antagonistic as you would expect, given the villainous ferocity from Clubber Lang (Rocky III) and the evil Ivan Drago (Rocky IV). But that's a minor blemish to an overall outstanding film made with grit, substance and style. At its best, Creed is a very intimate film for fans and newcomers and an undisputed knockout for 2015.

Ryan Coogler's Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.

From the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is "a fighter." The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.

One reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing "Creed" and "Fruitvale Station" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.

Some may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. 

The way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it's a terrific 2 hours to spend.

Geez, I wanted to like this movie. I love the Rocky saga, and I was intrigued by the idea of introducing Apollo Creed's son as the new protagonist. And once the film started getting rave reviews, I got *really* pumped to see it.

Unfortunately, I feel like I saw a different movie from everyone else. Sure, "Creed" has some good acting and a good heart, and it's somewhat respectful to the Rocky legacy. But, drat it, this film is really just a lazy remake of the first Rocky film, with Adonis Creed in Rocky's role and Rocky in Mickey's role. 

Worse than that - "Creed" rips off literally every preceding Rocky movie. It contains not a single original idea. Indeed, I recognized every scene - the illness subplot is recycled from "Rocky II," the boring office job material was previously seen in "Rocky Balboa," the training montage was in...well, all the old ones...and so on. Just changing the protagonist isn't enough to make this ancient material feel fresh.

There were some opportunities to explore new directions, but the filmmakers squandered most of them. For example, the beginning of the film builds up Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) as a compelling new character - but then she gets dropped like a hot potato about 1/4 of the way through the movie. And Adonis Creed's potentially interesting romance with Bianca (Tessa Thompson) develops in a very clichéd fashion; all Creed ever does is lie to Bianca or spoil things for her, yet somehow she loves him anyway. Why?

Even their "meet cute" scene didn't work for me. Bianca wakes Creed up by blasting music in their apartment building at 3:00 AM - which in a movie is charming behavior, but in real life would be incredibly annoying. Somehow, Creed is the only person in the building who comes to complain. Yeah, right.

On a more depressing note, I really don't like what the film does to Rocky's character. If you thought Rocky was a sad old man in "Rocky Balboa," you ain't seen nothing yet. The Rocky in this movie has given up on life, and that's not easy to watch. At least in "Rocky Balboa," we got to see Rocky rebuilding his life after losing Adrian, by drawing closer to his son and developing a friendship with Little Marie. But in this movie, his son and Little Marie are gone, and Rocky is just...waiting' on death. Ugh, how bleak. And I guess I'm supposed to believe that Rocky's forced, chemistry-free friendship with Adonis Creed gives him a reason to live again. Yikes.

I'm not sure why the critics are so into this movie - usually, they vilify sentimental, lazy remakes like this. I think perhaps they were really jazzed that Ryan Coogler of "Fruitvale Station" fame directed it. All I can say is, I hope "Fruitvale Station" is better than this. "Creed" is as unoriginal as a Star Wars movie about blowing up the Death Star. Worse yet, it reminded me of the inevitable passage of time in a sort of downer way. Yeah, I think I'll just pretend it doesn't exist, and toss it in the same bin with other passing-the-torch films like "Star Trek: Generations" and "Batman Forever." It's a better film than those, true, but no less of a drag.

Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so he gets some new blood with a familiar name.

Micheal B. Jordan plays Adonis(perfect name), a man who was in his mother's womb while his father, the legendary Apollo Creed got his ass handed to him in the 4th Rocky. With the same passion to fight as his father, he seeks out Apollo's old rival and best friend the Italian Stallion to teach him the skills to reclaim his legacy and become a new legend.

Like a good boxing movie should, Creed has heart. I'm such of fan of Micheal B. Jordan. He's got the charm and talent to become a movie star and Creed proves he's leading man material.

And much respect to Sly, who as an aged Rocky, is in the same spot as once franchise regulars, Micky and Paulie. It's humbling for a movie star to take a step back and let Jordan drive the vehicle in front of the camera, and Ryan Coogler sit in the director's chair and pen the flick, but obviously Sly cares about this cow and sought out the very best to make it the very best. Stallone also gave a performance of a lifetime worthy of an Oscar nod for supporting actor. He is Rocky, and watching him on the screen with Jordan was incredible cinema.

And the action in this movie was amazing. Some of the greatest battles in cinematic boxing are happening in Creed. We are so close to the action you can feel every hit. Also have to comment on Jordan's boxing skills. Creed, does an excellent job with showing a boxer going from having raw talent, to becoming a champion.

Definitely a worth wild boxing movie to see, and I think the best Rocky film since number two.

How any idiot could have the audacity to rate this movie higher than the original rocky is so beyond baffling I have no words for my displeasure with IMDb. creed is a predictable boxing movie with potential for a good movie, but is ultimately diminished by a boring plot line, a lack of special moments, and epic build up that all the great rocky movies had. The training scene was boring the build up was bad the plot was un realistic. not to mention they tarnished the legacy of a great movie character in apollo creed by having an affair with his wife, although it is necessary for the plot of the movie I don't agree with putting the great apollo creed in that light, especially since the rest of the movie everyone talks about him as this amazing man, how are non die hard rocky fans supposed to buy that? a few other issues, why did they turn Mickey's gym into the "bad guy" gym? shouldn't he have started in a new retro gym and came to rocky to train and he took him to Mickey's gym? That would have given all rocky fans a goose bump moment instead they were left with nothing. the only real shocker about this movie and (spoiler alert) is giving rocky cancer, that was probably the most intriguing part of the whole story. Also the build up of the leading couple was bad, i felt no connection to the two outside of the girl having that hearing problem there was nothing interesting about them. Finally the training scene was so stupid having all those guys do wheele's around him as he ran was so weird and ruined the entire scene. The fighting scenes were much more realistic and well choreographed compared to all the other rocky's which was this movies only really well done part, the ending of the fight is to a rocky fan, too predictable, it was great in rocky 1 and it was a fitting end to rocky 6, but makes no sense here and ended with the viewers questioning what next? instead of riding off into the sunset. the acting was solid by everyone involved but the writing was too corny to over come for the most part. a C-level movie at best

First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.

The 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be considered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe the hype cause it's merely disappointing. The movie on the surface tries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground stereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky has retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs of Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last name, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay includes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with an absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character suffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe for him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a supporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is trolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in IMDb, 94% in rotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely predictable and completely lacks emotion.

Grade: C- (D if you are not a Rocky fan)

Why is this movie getting such good reviews? There is nothing here. The plot is just like all the rest of the Rocky movies, they even bring back the poor chickens. Lots of jump rope too. Oh, sorry not exactly like the other Rocky movies, nobody died in this one, but he did visit the cemetery. 

Some stupid love interest that never went anywhere. An opponent that didn't even look like a boxer. Not enough boxing, probably because Stallone thought he could act well enough to carry the movie.

Creed: Please Rocky, come back and train me. Critic: Please Rocky, just go away.

This HAS to be the year of nostalgia with the Original Star Wars trilogy remake, the Return to Jurassic Park Reboot and the memory of 1960's Bond in Spectre. But, the one I never asked for, nor anyone really needed, was to see Rocky XXXVIII.

Butsince so many people kept asking my opinion on it and how many rave reviews I've heard that might equate Oscar buzz, I decided to check it out. I am sorry I did.

Not that the movie's ineptly made, it's just an incredible retread of countless boxing movies before it. Hell, it even played homage to all the previous Rocky training montages before itand repeatedly. Over and over. 

Half way through I was ready to give up with the extreme number of clichés and unoriginal ideas/paths, but figured the second half HAS to be better since so many people loved it so much.

Nope. The second half was just as dull and the same old story. In fact, once the climax hit  the obligatory finale in any of these boxing movies  I had completely tuned out. Not only did I know how it would pan out, I didn't care one bit.

This movie had one singular fresh idea (son of former boxing champ in the Rocky series, Apollo Creed, is introduced) but every single other minute was unoriginal and predictable from six scenes leading up. It was so by the numbers, it's a wonder anyone even cared to even mention the movie to me. I wish someone would tell me how this movie is so great and stands out from every other boxing film. 

Okay, the lead, Michael B. Jordan was decent, but he was just playing his role in this "should've been made-for-Lifetime-TV movie." Sylvester Stallone has reinvented himself many, many years ago, as an aging action star, and now he's completely beyond that. It's getting old and perhaps it's time, Sly

I guess if you're heavily into boxing, boxing movies AND just want to see the exact same movie you've seen countless times before, you might like it. Otherwise, it's an extreme waste of more than two hours.

First of all, I like to start out that the acting was pretty good, especially Sylvester Stallone, who is of course: "Rocky". The big problem with this movie is that it was written and directed by some one other than Sylvester Stallone. In all the Rocky movies Stallone was the writer, and besides the first Rocky and The fifth Rocky, Stallone was also the director. What my point is, is that this random dude, that both Wrote and directed this movie, made the movie "Creed", with his own style and junk that has never been in any of the 'Rocky" movies, and the story was very poorly written, as well as the whole flow to it. I really hated the sensuality in it, as well as the reasons why Adonis Creed became a full time boxer. The movie "Rocky" had so much more innocents and class and just the story all in all , just made so much more sense. Most importantly I felt no "Motivation" to "Creed" as a pose to "Rocky", because the story of "Rocky" just felt so real and innocent and full of purpose, which is complete opposite in the movie "Creed". In the movie "Rocky" you felt the motivation. Overall, to basically summarize everything, this movie had no class nor respect, for the previews movies, and the writing was so lame and so empty. Pretty much "Creed" was made for only one purpose... Money, cause the most of the stuff in this movie was a complete fail. The Creator of this movie knew that people would come to watch it,because of how great the "Rocky" series were, but like i said before, this movie was a complete bust, with only one intention, to put Rocky's name in this terrible film just to make money.

Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. 

Creed perfectly mixes elements from past Rocky movies, especially the first, with modern culture. The amazing Rocky score is complemented by modern styles. Creed's story is told just like Rocky's and it is so beautiful to watch. The cinematography is also visually pleasing. Coogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. The boxing scenes are excellent. There is a fight that is done completely in one take and I have no idea how they did it. It was amazing. This movie is a drama that tugs at your heart a lot, but at times it still manages to be quite funny as well. 

I love Creed as a film. Its characters are so well realized and acted, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the boxing is glorious. Creed is definitely one of the best films of 2015. Creed gets an A.

As a boxing movie Creed packs a heavyweight punch.

Sylvester Stallone (as the film's producer) has covered a lot of miles with his Rocky legend, most recently with his 2006 Rocky Balboa. As such I had thought there was little milk left in the cash cow, but "Creed" proves me wrong. This time, with Stallone's advancing years, he wisely doesn't stretch credibility by having Rocky Balboa as the center of the pugilism, but hands the baton to young contender Adonis ("Donnie") Creed (Michael B Jordan). Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Rocky's protagonist and later close friend in the first four Rocky films.

Donnie is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a big chip on his shoulder and a reputation for finding trouble with his fists. Brought back from the brink by Apollo's wife (a touching performance by Phylicia Rashad) Donnie can't escape his family legacy and seeks Balboa's help to make it in the ring, using his own adopted name. Balboa's help leads to a number of 'traditionally' brutal Rocky-style encounters in the ring. 

I must admit I don't normally 'go' for boxing films like this, but this is extremely well done. All of the boxing training is gritty and believable and the actual bouts, particularly the classic finale, is suitably thrilling and a technical masterpiece of camera-work (hats off to cinematographer Maryse Alberti, who also filmed "The Wrestler" so is no stranger to the ring). 

A real surprise is just how good Stallone is in the role. There are scenes where Stallone really has to act  particularly an emotional locker-room scene when Rocky faces up to his own personal crisis  and any jokes about Sylvester "Expendables" Stallone's acting abilities are forgotten. Michael B Jordan is also a great find and a name to watch. He has to cover a wide range during the film and succeeds admirably.

Tessa Thompson, impressive in last year's "Selma", makes a similarly positive impression here playing the love interest in the form of songstress Bianca, with a difficult future ahead of her.

"Creed" is a love letter to the old Rocky films, and  with this quality, and likely success  the start of a whole new generation of films seems probable. The respect it shows to the originals is characterized by a moving tribute to the classic 'Philadelphia steps' scene that brings a genuine lump to the throat. That being said, the film is a lot more 'street' for a new generation, with a soundtrack (by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson) that mixes rap and hip-hop with more classic orchestral elements. Without outright plagiarism of Bill Conti's classic score, Göransson subtly weaves in some of Conti's themes, notably Adrian's theme, as well as coming up with his own "Fly Now"- equivalent musical high-point.

Impressive direction is by Ryan Cooglar in only his second feature film (after Fruitvale Station, also with Michael B Jordan). Cooglar also wrote the story and co-wrote the script. Without any spoilers, the story is delightfully 'un-Hollywood" by being unpredictable in where it goes. However, an area for criticism is that it took a few 'easy' short-cuts in places: a particular 'change of heart' in the film is way to glib and quick.

Finally, i would love to watch this film in a cinema in Liverpool, when the "hallowed turf" for a bout is revealed as being Everton's ground, Goodison Park.! Generations of Liverpool FC fans will be turning in their graves and I predict that cinemas in the city could become scenes of the worst hand to hand combat since the finale of Kingsman!

Crud may refer to:

Waste, dirt, feces, or something of poor quality.

^^^ That right there is what Creed is. A massive pile of waste, dirt and feces.

Lets start with the pathetically contrived opening fight. Could they have made it any more trite and pathetic. It was like watching a drama class over act and fail miserably.

Little hard done by black boy gets taken in by his step-mom (or whoever she was, who give a $hit) and lives a life of luxury in what looked like the equivalent of the white house in size and surprise surprise, turns out to be a spoilt brat. Why in the hell would i give a flying toss about this over privileged penile head at all????? Congratulations on making me hate the character in a matter of minutes. 

From there on in, I didn't give a flying toss about this loser. He is conceited and arrogant and offers up his prized car if anyone can beat him in a sparring match, and gets floored. Lol. What a loser.

How/why would anyone care about this guy? i get that he was supposed to be a bit of a big head like his father but you don't make him totally unlikeable. 

What else happens in this dud of a movie...lets see...a contrived, pointless, irritating love interest, which was a major ball ache and snooze fest. God awful dialogue that made me howl with laughter. Awful camera work. Don't even get me started on the Scouser boxer...ha ha. Worst acting in the world.

By the time the Liverpudlians manager came to talk to Rocky and penile head Creed about fighting, i turned the abomination off. A complete waste of everyones time.

The joke about taking a picture of the training routine and putting it on the 'cloud' was pathetic, rocky not being able to spell Shadow...

I find Michael B. Jordan to be a very unlikeable person as well. I also think he's a sub par actor. How many times does he have to pout throughout the film? It looks like there's something wrong with his chin, and I just got irritated looking at his smug face constantly. The guy is a massive bore.

Creed is a joke. shame on you Stallone for entertaining this bull$hit film.

what a shame this could have been such a good film not bad acting by Stallone but its the story line that lets this film down how it has got a 8/10 is beyond belief only has 4 fights and is the world champion no big build up the one guy who knocks him out does not reappear to fight him so no revenge the make up on the eye of the last fight was terrible the original make up was bad but i thought 2016 but no not even a little bit believable its was not bad acting that spoiled the film just a bad story line the fact that Stallone has cancer should have been a bigger storyline in ie just living long enough to see him win or his deaf girlfriend signing him to get up after being knocked down but none of this they could have had the ghost of apollo shadow boxing with him in the ring anything but this such a waste of a film that could have been so much better

Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.

But between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as Sly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of Philadelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It all really comes together with Creed.

But as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in that fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV he had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an illegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of Adonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster care as his natural mother had died and raised him.

Jordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son and wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis Johnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a mentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight championship. 

Rocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but he sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some personal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable help to each other.

I really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this point. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.

When we saw the review rating for this movie, which was very high, on On Demand, we thought we were in for a treat. It was incredibly boring and a waste of time. We sat through most of it hoping and thinking it would get better. It didn't and we lost all hope. Very little character development so that you didn't care about any of them. Sylvester Stallone seemed to have difficulty staying in character and he sometimes looked like Rock Hudson in a creepy way. Didn't believe the love relationship between Creed Jr and his neighbor; no chemistry there at all. Lastly, even though it is indicated that this review may contain spoilers, which is described as "A spoiler is usually defined as a remark or piece of information which reveals important plot elements (for example the ending or a major plot twist), thus 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film.", I doubt there is anything that could spoil this movie....it is that bad.

If you have watched the original Rocky and think it is a near classic, then Creed is close. Maybe not a classic, because only time will tell. But it is close in terms of look and feel. There are scenes, tempo, performances, music, and of course the setting (Philadelphia) which harken back to the award winning 1976 film. This is not a comparison piece, but Creed is what the earlier release this year of Southpaw could have been; a gritty, modern day boxing film.

Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station), plays the titular character (using the name Donnie Johnson) who yearns to exorcise his demons/ follow his dreams in the boxing ring. Without giving anything away, he's the son of the late, great Apollo Creed and he sets out to find any trainer willing to take him on. He can fight, but he's raw and needs refinement if he's going to be taken seriously.

His search lands him in his father's old Philly stomping ground, where he pester's one Rocky Balboa (Stallone) into training him. He pulls every angle to get Rocky to help him since his pop and Rocky were combatants and close friends before he died. Once Rocky begrudgingly gives in, things begin to coalesce. Stallone is excellent as the "Mickey"-esque Balboa. Although he didn't write the screenplay for Creed, he is one of the producers and his presence is felt. The dynamic between his character and Creed is perfect. The right combination of old school and new school. One scene is indicative when Creed takes a picture on his phone of Rocky's workout routine then tells him it's "in the cloud" to Rocky's bewilderment.

In Creed, director and writer Ryan Cogler is reunited with Jordan. As Creed, Jordan's performance is on part with Stallone's. He imbues his character with just the right amount of bravado, not cockiness, just confidence, hunger, and drive. He also trained and bulked up for the role. But he's not all fierce competitor, he has funny, sensitive sides as well. Cogler's team decided Creed should have a love interest. The relationship he forges with a local neo- soul artist played by Tessa Thompson (Dear White People) could have been syrupy, but thankfully it doesn't overshadow the main theme or feel forced. Frankly, some of the scenes with Thompson and Jordan are very good and so is their chemistry.

Creed is an excellent example of mixing newcomers with established names on both sides of the camera and having the end result come out perfect. The crew and cast turn in great work. Cogler had the fortune and skill to work with people who know what it takes to put together a film that would appeal to critics and audiences alike. There were a couple scenes that are "wow" moments, not just fight scenes, which are are amazing, but little scenes that are set up, shot (by Maryse Alberti) and acted that will have a lasting effect on the viewer. Maybe classic isn't a stretch.

After looking at the ratings, I was curious to know, why this movie was not nominated at the Golden Globes, Was it because of the tough competition? The answer is No. This movie is definitely not a top 250 material. Secondly, the movie is full of clichés, from starting to End. You watch, each and every element, unfold, just like all Sports movies. Knowing what will happen Next. The movie lacked an angle, playing on an angle about being Creed's Blood is not that catchy. The movie had some really sloppy contrived moments, specially When Creed finds the hospital brochure in Rocky's jacket and finds out that Rocky has Cancer. Now, why would Creed check Rocky's jacket. The whole scene looks contrived The moment when Creed runs and Bikers move around him and Rocky looks at him from the top and everyone is cheering for their favorite boy Creed, that is too old school and not something you expect from a great movie. The movie worked well in bits and pieces. The point with Rocky was that his opponents had a character, They did try to build Creed's opponent's story, but it was not well executed. Too many scenes featuring Creed and Bianca.. But Creed had its moments, Yes, Rocky looked like a pro,the way he dealt with situations, the way he was analyzing the moves of the opponent, he makes you feel that this is the same Rocky, I had cheered for in the past.

Look stop me if you heard this before but Once upon a time a poor downtrodden lad from the wrong side of the tracks finds a purpose in life and rescues himself from a dead end life and finds wealth and happiness from the fruits of his efforts Sounds like every story ever written doesn't it and the only stand out is that it's yet another movie in the ROCKY franchise . To be fair the Italian stallion isn't really the focus of the story and the story revolves around the son of the late Apollo Creed , a son has it happens he didn't know he had and a son no one else in the universe knew he had apart from the producers of this movie . Did someone say contrived ? How about another word beginning with C - cynical ? Yes that's the word we're looking for . Cynical 

But this isn't a film for cynics and it helps if you don't view this film through cynical eyes because like the original ROCKY from 40 years ago . It certainly tries to be feel good and might just succeed on that account if you're in the mood . Director Ryan Coogler does cast well with up and comer Michael B Jordan in the title role with real life boxers such as Ward and Bellew as pugilists and it's probably the only film you'll see where the climax takes place at Goodison Park in Liverpool . No doubt the people who enjoyed the previous films in the ROCKY series will enjoy this one but you've seen it all before many times even down to having the bad guys speak with British accents

This is not actually a movie rather than a Jordan shoes and chemotherapy 2 hour commercial.

I turned off the film the moment I saw Rocky training Jordan while doing chemotherapy. Who writes this crap anyways. Who's idea was it to give Rocky cancer ? Maybe in the next film Rocky dies, goes to Hell and trains Apollo Creed to fight the Devil. What a load of crap.

Everybody at one point made fun of the Rocky saga because one day we would see Rocky dying of old age but still fighting in the ring. Stallone actually made a Rocky film out of this joke. This is really weird.

What's next ? Adrian The Rocky Chronicles ?

The Rocky saga has been milked to it's last breath with this one.

Appolo's abandoned kid with social behavior problems, a deaf girlfriend who is a singer, Rocky has cancer, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey, Appolo, Appolo's wife are all dead. Everybody is dead but yet Sly filmed another Rocky movie and had a director who has never directed a film before.

Give me a break man, it is a failed attempt to do a sports drama movie all the way to the grave. Stallone did an excellent drama job with the first movies and no one was dead or dying.

I have only one message to Mr.Stallone. Let the Rocky saga be, man. Just let it go. You don't need the money and we don't need a Rocky movie inspired by a school joke from 1985.

Just like it's counterpart, even this 7th installment to the franchise has proved the fact that the true story of the universe has just begun. Creed just like the original movie of the series has a strict focus on the characters, their struggles and eventual triumph, with only a role switch with the son of "The Apollo Creed " . This is one of the only few movies I loved watching this year, and I am pretty much thankful I did. In this review I shall justify the reason as to why this movie has received a rating as high as a 9/10.

1)Story :- The basic story is backed by a pretty good script and an engaging narrative that puts Adonis Johnson / Creed , son of Apollo creed in the centre of the fight this time. But unlike his father's story , this man is forced to battle his unfulfilled passion for fighting , unjustified emotions that cross him and a blockade that brands him as a man born from someone else's legacy. The story technically puts Adonis on the radar, while the people around believe him to be a man whose fame comes by his father's legacy. This is a story of how a man, with a will to create a mark in history for himself, steps into the ring, not only fighting the fight , but battling his priorities. The story sometimes is vague reminder of the first rocky, but the distinctive performances from both actors see to it that this movie rises beyond those insignificant questions. 

2)Casting And Characters:- The casting and characterization of this cast is what makes this movie splendid. Though the script is more or less that of a generic boxing movie seen a million times before , it is the distinctive performances by the lead Michael B Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. This is one of those movies that solely concentrates it's screen time on only those characters that require screen space to ideologically progress the story. While the movie consists of other members like Bianca the love interest and Mary Creed , Adonis's mother , all these plot devices are only meant to build the tension during the final fight and are completely disposable , since they add little to nothing to the actual plot to be significant . But what is evident is that director Ryan Coogler, has done is absolute best to pull the best out of every cast member who was a part of this movie. But when all is done and said, I cannot be absolutely fair while I express my love for the man who started it all , and the man who almost overshadowed Creed's performance in this movie , The Rocky Balboa a.k.a Sylvester Stallone. This man has proved the fact with this movie that he is not just the broody, rough and tough man who does action movies but is an actor who has the potential to ACT. That's right, Sylvester Stallone after a million fails has proved that he is no more expendable. His performance swelled my eyes with tears and without spoiling anything, Ryan Coogler's decision to modify the characters life in the way he did so , was not just best for the plot , but best for the ultimately produced definitive performances too.

3)Direction :- When directing a movie for a franchise that has spanned for many generations it is a risky move for us audience when we witness a new chapter. The movie could either be a project made as a nostalgic cash grab or a passion project that respects it's previous entries but becomes different and distinct at the same time. And just like the Creed in the movie, Ryan Coogler has proved that this movie is not just made as a product of Rocky's legacy but a project that has the ability to stand on one's own foot to essentially act as a reinvigoration of what Rocky was originally imagined to be. Coogler has managed to build a completely new atmosphere for this franchise that gives a sense of difference and change but at the same time , affixes us to the city of Philadelphia that we have known and loved since the original Rocky with the perfectly cued original soundtracks that assures us that we are actually connected to the world we always loved. It is evident that the style of direction that Coogler used for this movie is something completely different from the previous Rocky movies. This one goes in the line of other dark boxing movies such as Warrior where colours of the world around are dumbed down to create this dark and gloomy environment and everything in the frame of perspective is saturated with detail to create an exact and realistic picture of the sport of boxing in the best way possible . What I was let down by , slightly , was Coogler's quick jump takes and cut-shots during the final fight , that actually put me out of the intensity that the shot had to have. Overall, Coogler's direction is brilliant in many ways and it was his vision that was desperately needed to create , progress and continue the now 6 movie franchise. If you have already watched the movie, the final scene of Rocky climbing the stairs followed by a focus shot of the city from the height explains exactly why I praise his direction so much.

On a whole it was an absolutely unexpected journey filled with the excitement, vigor and energy that every Rocky movie had. If you are a person who would step in a theatre or watch this movie just for the fights, let me warn you right away and tell you that you will be disappointed. This movie is a directorial and character driven drama whose ultimate underline of boxing gives the much needed progressive element for the plot. And is definitely one of the best movies of 2015.

Boxers over the years have had a notoriously hard time figuring out when it's time to hang up the gloves and quit. They keep coming back, and it gets to the point of being pathetic as you watch once magnificent fighters fade away into shadows of what they were. Think Muhammad Ali. Or Larry Holmes. Or Sugar Ray Leonard. Or Evander Holyfield. All once great fighters who just couldn't let it go. Sylvester Stallone is, of course, an actor and not a boxer. But his most iconic role is Rocky Balboa - a boxer. And as I watched this movie (actually not much more than a few minutes into it) I started to think that Stallone was a little bit like Ali or Holmes or Leonard or Holyfield. He should have just let Rocky go. I rather liked "Rocky Balboa" - what I thought would have been the last film in the series. I thought it was a decent film, and a good way of tying things up. But almost 10 years later, Stallone had to do it again. And the result was Ali-like, or Leonard-like. Etc., etc.

The great thing about the Rocky movies was that you couldn't help but root for Rocky. Whether the movie was good or bad (and the series had both) you always rooted for Rocky. He was everyone's ultimate fantasy - the down and out guy with no prospects who gets to live his dream and makes good at it. But in "Creed" you don't get that. I didn't much care for Adonis Creed - Apollo's son (in a convoluted sort of way that I really didn't understand, probably because I just didn't care enough to keep it straight in my head.) The character didn't resonate with me. Win. Lose. I didn't care. What I couldn't figure out was why Rocky bothered with him. The basic story is that Adonis makes good after a troubled childhood, apparently has a pretty good job that he suddenly quits to become a fighter. (And who, exactly was Phylicia Rashad - who played Apollo's widow - to him anyway? And why did she care all that much?) He searches out Rocky, convinces Rocky to train him - and then everything comes pretty easy for him actually. But the character just didn't resonate with me; I had no feelings for him whatsoever. When you mix that in with a story that seemed to be lacking in direction or flow you end up with a movie that just bores you. And that's what happened to me. I struggled through it (I admit I may have lost the battle and nodded off for 5 or 10 minutes about halfway through, but I can't imagine I missed anything of vital importance) but it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

I know there was a bit of Oscar controversy. Stallone got nominated for Best Supporting Actor. And, in this year when charges of racism were levelled at the Academy, people wanted to know why, if Stallone got nominated, Michael B. Jordan didn't get a Best Actor nomination. Truthfully? Neither should have been nominated, nor should the movie have been, although I heard some folk speculate that it might get a Best Picture nomination - which it didn't. The movie just wasn't that good. The performances weren't that good. Stallone can play Rocky. We know that. And he plays Rocky well. But he's done it so often that nothing here would have stretched him at all. Perhaps more should have been done with Rocky's battle with cancer - but that was never really developed very much. Stallone's nomination was about honouring Stallone, and not about honouring his performance in this particular movie. And Jordan just didn't have whatever it takes to draw me onside with him. Best Actor? Even just a nomination? I don't think so.

I will admit that this movie has nostalgia going for it. Lots and lots of nostalgia. It's as if the producers (and there's too many of them to list!) realized that neither the story nor the characters would be a draw, so they went with nostalgia. "Creed" pays homage to various aspects of previous "Rocky" movies. Adonis is a sort of Rocky-type character. (Please promise me that they're not going to start a series of Creed movies. PLEASE!) Rocky visits the graves of Paulie and Adrian. He gives Adonis the Adrian speech from "Rocky III" - "you have to do this for you!" There's Mickey's gym, and Rocky comes across a bit like Mickey - having Adonis chase chickens around to build up speed. There's lots of nostalgia. But there's not much more worthwhile.

At times it really captures the feel of an 80s movie.

The central plot is striped down to the bare minimum. There's a strong character arc - a redemption story. A looming bad guy in the background. And visually it's a nice film to watch, with some masterfully shot boxing scenes.

But where it tries to be Rocky, it's not Rocky ... Rocky was the classic every-man story. A struggling, maybe a bit slow, man trying to make his way in the world... Creed is about an LA rich kid with a chip on his shoulder. And where it could have been a boxing film, it focuses far too much on the love interest - which is neither relatable or convincing... Ultimately what you're left with is a love story without any romance, and a boxing story without a struggle.

By my own admission, I've never been a huge fan of the Rocky franchise. It took me years to watch Rocky and though I recognise it as a well crafted film, I was unable to fall in love with it like so many others have. Regardless of this, I found myself looking forward to Creed and hoping that, despite my disconnection from the Rocky franchise, it would stand on it's own as an entertaining film, and I'm pleased to say that not only was it able to do that, it also made me want to watch the previous entries which I originally had very little interest in.

Rocky was so successful because it existed as not just a film about an underdog, but because it forged an emotional connection between audiences and it's central character, Rocky Balboa. One of the people that felt this connection was young director Ryan Coogler, previously known for his work on Fruitvale Station which also stars Michael B. Jordan. It's Coogler's love for the franchise that led him to write the screenplay for Creed and convince Sylvester Stallone that this was a film which had to be made in order to continue the legacy of Rocky, bringing it to a new generation of fans. Thank god he did, because Coogler has created a film that pays respect to what has come before it, as well as moving the story forward, and the amount of love and care that went in to crafting it is recognisable in every scene.

In order to tell this story properly, however, Coogler had to create a character that could stand alongside Rocky and forge an emotional connection with fans both old and new. Donnie is the underdog for a new generation, full of rage and pent up frustration when we first meet him as a child in 1998, two traits which have stayed with him as he grows older. The underdog aspect of his character is nothing we haven't seen before, yet he is so well realised as a man aspiring to be like his father, and so well portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, that it's much more effective than many other failed attempts to create a character such as this. His drive and motivation are extremely justifiable, as is his reasoning that he has to make a name for himself without relying on his father's legacy. The latter is an interesting dynamic within the film as it adds further depth to the character, showcasing the pride he has in his own abilities, while also hinting at the anger and grief he still feels due to the fact he never met Apollo Creed before his death at the hands of Ivan Drago. The relationships he shares with Rocky and aspiring singer/songwriter Bianca (Tessa Thompson) lead him to come to terms with his father's death, enabling him to move on from his anger and in turn providing a satisfying character arc. These relationships also show that pride alone is not enough, and despite his reluctance to use his father's name, Donnie realises that he cannot make it on his own. Enter the former champion and friend of Apollo, Rocky Balboa.

Sylvester Stallone's career has found it's legs again over the past few years thanks to the relatively successful, yet extremely disappointing, Expendables franchise. In Creed, however, Stallone proves that he can still act without relying upon a bunch of 80s nostalgia, and his performance may very well be the best of his career. One of Hollywood's hard men, Stallone shows a different side to himself here, delicate and world weary after seeing all of his friends and loved ones pass away. One scene in particular deals with this brilliantly, pulling at the audience's heartstrings as Stallone delivers a series of lines which highlight his grief. He also has some of the funniest dialogue in the film, his world weariness and age coming across as he tries to understand a world which features technology such as the Cloud. Recently nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Stallone is undoubtedly the best part of Creed and perhaps does the most to ensure the film doesn't become just another title in the long list of boxing movies.

As well as great characters, the boxing scenes in Creed are also extremely enjoyable to watch. Coogler opts to use long takes which show every aspect of the fights, including the brutal hits Donnie both receives and dishes out on multiple occasions. The final showdown with 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (played by real life British boxer Tony Bellew) is at times painful to watch as the two boxers exchange blows over the course of the fight, dripping blood and sweat onto the floor of the ring as they do so. There's no moments which are quite as gruesome as those seen in last years Southpaw, yet the scenes which do involve boxing are far more effective than any in recent memory, largely due to the connection we have towards Donnie and his trainer.

There are flaws to be found, mostly because of the parallels between the film and Rocky, but it's important to realise that this is not only a continuation of the franchise, but also a love letter to it. Coogler and his cast have managed to create a boxing film which will appeal to audiences both old and new, as well as fans of the sport and those that have very little interest in it. In a world that is saturated by remakes, reboots, and sequels, it's refreshing to say that Creed manages to stand on it's own as a great piece of filmmaking.
