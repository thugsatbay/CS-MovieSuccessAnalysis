### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I appreciate a pretty wide variety of films. I wouldn't call myself an indie junkie, but I like creativity that gets me to think or be aware in a new way and indie can certainly do that. Of course, sometimes aspects of a film will evade me (what was X about? what did Y mean?) and then I seek out others--and IMDb--to fill in the gaps.

I have to admit, I left this film lost and unsatisfied. Too MUCH of it was a gap for me. Sure, I had some basic insights: how the normal-ness of life is worthy of attention and how the painful constancy of loneliness exists in so many lives. The acting was good. I found the long pans and the "un-action" movie action interesting. At least for a while. But by about halfway, that was it. Those insights just repeated themselves. I spent the second half hoping for something to shed light, to at least tie some loose ends together. But it never came.

And it wasn't just me and my friend. As we sat in the emptying theater after the movie, discussing our thoughts about it, an elderly lady shuffled out behind us and said, "I don't mean to blow my own horn, but I have a Ph.D. in English Literature. And STILL I can't figure out what that movie was about! Do you?" So it wasn't just me.

This is all I can conclude: This film slowly detailed 3 vignettes, suggesting there was something being told. Then it had nothing to say. Maybe it's a Zen thing. But it wasn't a satisfying experience for me. The stories came out of nowhere and went nowhere, albeit with some beautiful scenes and emotions presented along the way and excellent acting. When it was over, there was no "there" there for me. I think that's what left me feeling unsatisfied. It was like a pretty mosaic left in pieces. I can infer that someone formed a design with it and I want to see that design. But it's in pieces and, try as I might, I can't put the pieces together. In fact, it feels like some pieces are missing. So I walk away baffled.

Maybe this says more about me than this movie. Whatever the case, I walked away unsettled and not in an enlightened way. That didn't feel good.

Greetings again from the darkness. This is surely one of the most intriguing movies of the year that is about women and by a woman. Writer/director Kelly Reichardt (Wendy and Lucy, 2008) has adapted the short stories from Maile Meloy into a film with 3 segments focusing on the daily perseverance of three women in small town Montana (including a rare Wyoming joke).

The first segment has lawyer Laura Dern returning to the office after an  umm  "long lunch meeting". Waiting for her is her client played by Jared Harris ("Mad Men"). The frustration between the two is palpable. Things take a turn for the worse as the sheriff calls Dern to the scene where Harris has taken a hostage at gunpoint. The issues on display here include the lack of respect for a female attorney, her unsatisfying personal life, and the one-way trust that can happen in times of desperation.

In the next story, we follow Michelle Williams and her husband James LeGros as they meet with a lonely elderly neighbor (Rene Auberjonis) and offer to buy some limestone blocks that have been sitting on his property for decades. The subtlety of the conversation embodies the missing respect and power of Ms. Williams' character.

Emotions are exploding beneath the surface in the third segment featuring horse handler Lily Gladstone as she stumbles into a class being taught by Kristen Stewart, and is immediately captivated by the smart young teacher. Where this attraction leads is further commentary on the challenges faced by those trying to escape the daily drudgery of their lives.

The above recaps don't come close to capturing the extraordinary quiet and stillness that director Reichardt uses in an emotionally powerful manner. These three women are all intelligent and filled with both pride and visceral disappointment  each quietly suffering, yet trudging forward with the emptiness each day brings. They each have a feeling of isolation  even if they aren't truly alone, and failed or lackluster relationships certainly play a role.

The acting and cinematography (film, not digital!) is as expert as the directing. Ms. Gladstone is truly a standout by saying few words out loud, but speaking volumes with her open and pleading eyes. The nuance of each scene is where the most interest is, and the overall mood of the characters and tone of the stories overcome the fact that we are plopped into these lives with little or no backstory. As each one softly crashes (two figuratively, one literally), we understand these are the faces of strong women who will continue to do what's necessary  even if that's shoveling horse poop. The film is dedicated to Ms. Reichardt's dog Lucy (a key to her personal and professional life).

You know from the movie previews and the rumblings from the multiplex's adjacent theater that today's movies are heavily weighted toward "action films." Writer-director-editor Kelly Reichardt could singlehandedly reverse that trend with Certain Women, which can most succinctly be described as an "inaction film." It's kind of hard to get used to Reichardt's pace, so you might watch this and think "Wha---?" Here, the drama is at the deep inside the characters, hidden from all views except the closest. And that's what it gets from Reichardt"a poet of silences and open spaces," says A.O. Scott in the New York Times. Based on short stories by Maile Meloy, the film is set in and around Livingston, Montana, and the views of the lonely snowswept plains are breathtaking. The story is presented in three separate vignettes that barely intersect. In the first, Laura Dern plays Laura Wells, a lawyer trying to convince her persistent client (Jared Harris) that he can't sue his former employer for on-the-job injuries because he already accepted a settlement. The client doesn't believe it until a male lawyer tells him the same thing. She's disappointed at many levelswith her clients, her career, her love life. The middle vignette involves Gina (Michelle Williams), a married woman with a disaffected teenage daughter. She and her husband are building a new house, and she hopes to convince a slightly addled, elderly neighbor (Rene Auberjonois) to sell them a pile of unused sandstone blocks in his front yard. Behind Gina's bright smile, you can feel her irritation that the neighbor focuses his attention not on her request but on her husband, eliding the decision, and finally the husband sells her out. Even within the bosom of her family, it's clear, she's alone. The dreamiest and most poignant sequence follows the young woman Jamiebeautifully underplayed by Lily Gladstoneon her daily routine, feeding and caring for a group of horses on a remote ranch. The repetitiveness of her tasks in the snowy, mountains in the distance, is mesmerizing. Her routine and her equilibrium are disturbed by a chance acquaintance with Beth, a harried young lawyer played by Kristen Stewart, overwhelmed by her own, very different grind. The extent of Jamie's disturbance is painfully revealed in her quiet face, upon which "silent passion surges like an underground stream," Scott says. The acting is subtle and true, and Reichardt closely follows the dictum, "show, don't tell." Her characters don't scream and rail and tell you what their issues are. You see it laid bare in front of you.

"Certain Women" (2016 release; 107 min.) brings several stories about ordinary women in a remote community in Montana. As the movie opens, we get to know Laura Wells, a lawyer who just had a quickie with her lover over lunch time ("I had a meeting", she says to her assistant upon getting back to the office). Waiting for Laura is a disgruntled client, who feels he's been cheated out of an injury settlement he feels he's entitled to. An exasperated Laura decides to take him to another lawyer for a second opinion. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director-editor Kelly Reichardt, the acclaimed indie movie director who previously brought us "Wendy & Lucy" and "Meek's Cutoff" (both starring Michelle Williams, who returns here as well). The movie brings three basically unrelated stories (based on Maile Meloy's collection "Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It"), and they all involve very ordinary people and ordinary lives that are shook up in one way or another (I'm biting my lips here, but won't spoil anything). The first story stars Laura Dern as the lawyer and Jared Harris as the disgruntled client; the second story stars Michelle Williams as the wife/mother in a strained marriage. The best, though, is saved for last, when we watch with fascination (and heartbreak) what unfolds between Kristen Stewart (as the Livingston, MT lawyer teaching a school law class in faraway Belfry, MT) and Lily Gladsone (as the lonesome horse rancher attending the class). I cannot recall seeing Kristen Stewart being more authentic in any previous role, even as compared to her roles in, say, "On the Road" or "The Runaways". Another major plus for the movie is that Reichardt lets a scene develop. Certain camera shots seemingly last forever. I don't mean to be snobby, but one of the reviews posted here gives this movie the lowest possible rating and compares it to 'watching paint dry'. I feel rather sorry for that person that he or she cannot appreciate a high quality movie like "Certain Women" (it is not a coincidence that this is rated 96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).

"Certain Women" premiered at the Sundance film festival earlier this year to great acclaim, and finally opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and you could hear a pin drop during much of the movie, as the audience seemed glued to their seat and the big screen. If you are in the mood for a top-notch indie movie with several great character studies and correlating outstanding acting performances, you cannot go wrong with this. "Certain Women" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This movie has great actors and was playing at Amerst Cinema which usually shows only very good films, many independent. However, I feel compelled to say this is not a movie worth paying to see in the theater. It watches like a hastily finished school film project. It had no real storyline, just slice of life stuff that wasn't really too interesting. Maybe I'm not as sophisticated as some film people but I'd guess at least 9 out of 10 people who watch this film won't enjoy it at all and those few that claim they did will do so only because they think it makes some sort of deep point but, if given truth serum no one would or could actually claim to have been entertained. As an aside, it also makes the wonderful state of Montanna seem like a terrible place, which it's not! Anyway, wait for Netflix because this is not worth paying your hard earned money to see - trust me!

Director Kelly Reicart knows strong women and the strong circumstances they've faced moving West (Meek's Cutoff) and more than 100 years later the modern Northwest (Certain Women). Big Sky Country, Montana, is the modern setting: Billings, Bozeman, and environs, the places where three women are ignored by men, misunderstood by both men and women, and call many of the shots that may end up putting food on their tables and courage in their hearts.

Although feminists should be proud of the three heroines in Certain Women, their actions are not so much the stuff of heroics as they mostly navigate around misogyny and sloth in a world that mostly listens to men first even if the women are right most of the time.

Laura Wells (Laura Dern) is an attorney with not really a thriving practice, but she gets along. One client, Fuller (Jared Harris), is a worker trying in vain to get more compensation for an accident while he slowly becomes derailed. In the most fraught incident of the trilogy, she must enter a building with a bullet-proof vest to face him as he holds a guard hostage. That she is the one to confront him, and not a crisis squad, is one of the stories' touches that clarifies why the heroines are "certain" women.

Gina Lewis (Michelle Williams) is building a prairie house, part of which will be built with a pile of stones, she, not her husband, tries to convince an old man to sell. Her quiet resolve in the face of mostly feckless men is not so much heroic as it is her certainty that she must be the strong one.

Jamie (Lily Gladstone), a portly ranch hand who falls for an evening school teacher-lawyer, Beth Travis (Kristen Stewart), is the least glamorous of the three (no I Phone for this cowgirl) but with an inner depth that eclipses the other two. Jamie and Beth's evening ride to the diner on a horse is romantic in a subtle way rarely seen before.

If you think I haven't described anything dramatically worthy of a full-length motion picture, you're right. The real drama bleeds out of the actors' interior depictions, the personal strength that overcomes diminishment by the vast plains, snow-capped mountains, and weak men.

Because the three episodes are derived from native Maile Maloy's short stories, Certain Women is a tour de force of feminism disguised as rambling stories of women making a hard living in a hard West. Hooray for them as the cowboys and the horses are not the real forces at work.

I like to see independent films,they have certain charm to them,they talk about personal things,without any showing off or big budget stuff in the big productions. But when it comes to this film, i failed to see the purpose to it. So all the leading characters are women,great then what. Sadly nothing,it's painful to see how much slow and boring it is. And you keep waiting for the big reveal ,the one that will make all this meaningless stories finally make sense. but that never happens as well. I mean what's the connection between the four women,what's so special about them,why are we watching them. No clue. I guess not all the independent films are worth seeing,this one is no exception.

Pretty fine piece of work, flawless.

But no one should review this film. Ignore the ratings. The best thing would be you sit down with the expectations you cultivated all your life, and take the trip. For my part, it was maybe 20 minutes after the closing credits I realized what had happened to me. And if you're lucky, you'll find out too.

I've written myself into a corner, and I don't care to discuss it. No wait, there is something I'd like to say here. The most interesting character is the director. Maybe that's how it should be. Kelly Reichardt is now required viewing for me. I wouldn't have guessed she was so young. And now I want to see her other work, but mostly where she goes from here.

I heard about this movie one morning watching the news. They made mention of a new Kristen Stewart movie, and that caught my attention. Mostly because I remember her from when she was here filming Twilight years ago, and the week I spent hoovering around the production crew watching how they make movies. So, because of that, I decided to pay attention to the interview. 

They showed a small part from the movie of her in the diner with Jamie. Clearly to highlight Kristen's roll, but it was actually Jamie (Lily Gladstone) that got me interested in the movie. There was just something about her that attracted me to knowing more about what this story was about. I looked the movie up, on here. Read about it, saw some trailers, and became instantly curious and had to go see it, and I really glad I did.

This movie is really easy to relate too for everyday life. That's one of the main things I love about it, but I couldn't relate with the first 2 chapters. I did enjoy the first, more than the second, but it was the third that really got me.

Lily Gladstone's character and the amazing job she did, will make you feel. We've all seen movies that have tear jerking moments where we wipe our eyes and move on like nothing happened. Not here...Lily stole this movie. 

Her performance was so amazing it grabbed my be all emotions, and held me on the edge. It made me feel in a way I have never felt before watching a movie with how real and how much I, and most people can relate to her in life whether someone is alone, or just lonely in our heads. We've all felt what she makes us feel. 

(Not spoiler, this is in articles) The way she feels isolated and lonely and goes out just to try and find interaction with anyone, the way she just wants to be surrounded by people and even sitting in the back of the class is enough to feel included and a part of something. We've all felt that. 

I also loved the ending, which I can only imagine was left open for personal interpretation. I could be wrong though... You'll just have to make up your own mind when you see it.

That's why this movie is a must see. 

Thank you Lily, for such an amazing, and real performance, and making me feel along your journey with you.

P.S. If you are someone who has been or still does feel alone, or lonely whether in life, or in your own mind. Just remember when you go see this movie. 

You will be in a room full of people who think and feel exactly the way you do. Strike up a conversation with someone. You might just make a friend.

This trilogy feels like a film school end of term project.

Nice try and some good shots, but if you want to get paid...

Might get an academy award if there was one for "three slices of boring lives."

MY GF and I searched long and hard and after significant stretching decided the theme here might be

lawyers get involved with strange, lonely people and need a lot of discipline to detach from those who cannot be helped and sometimes, especially women, they are stuck to their tar baby clients...

Though it's not clear the one certain woman is a lawyer, she might be.

This will have great value for film students as a lesson in how to make a nicely shot movie that goes nowhere. 

Take note of the "camera attached in and out of moving car or truck" shots with good audio, kids.

Kelly Reichardt is one of those director/writers who has made it their focus to film, the unfilmable, ordinary people in their downtime simply reacting or not reacting to things. This is all well and good, and each piece of Certain Women works beautifully on their own, but as a collection pulled together it feels random and unfocused and not in a good way. 

The three stories of Certain Women are all set in and around the same small town in Montana and are also loosely connected (a few side characters show up in different segments which are more of a distraction than a convincing narrative thread). The women of the three stories are Laura (Laura Dern) a personal injury lawyer dealing with a disabled and embittered client who won't accept that he signed away his rights, Gina (Reichardt's muse Michelle Williams, working with her fort the third time) an uptight woman trying to get the material needed for her dream home, and Jamie (newcomer Lily Gladstone, amazing), a lonely rancher who unexpectedly falls for a lawyer she meets in the strangest of circumstances. The stories are all very undramatic and subtle but in Reichardt's hands the material absolutely sings. There is a lot of depth and nuance to these characters and it is wonderful to watch them. Unfortunately she does not afford equal time to all the characters and this has the effect of making her film feel lopsided. 

The best segment in the film is the one with Gladstone's rancher, and I sincerely wish that Reichardt had worked out a way to pad it out with 40 more minutes of material because at 50 minutes it is the longest segment by far and it is the most interesting and the most poignant.

1. Some of the best acting I've seen. An honesty that grabs you without you knowing it. Cinematographic magic. 2. A story flow that defies description- three vignettes that define a time and space that elevates the mundane to aesthetic intensity. 3. Makes you reach down deep and learn what it means to be a human being, to possess empathy, to know quiet conflict. 4. Reached inside me to find places I thought were hidden, places I've tried to forget. 5. This is not hyperbole, the film is a masterpiece of commonplace realism and makes all other films I've seen about relationship, expectation and emptiness seem like child's play. 6. An uncanny sense of situation and direct immersion into the seeming actual lives of others. 7. If you understand the "Dogme 95" film movement, these comments will make more sense to you.

Kelly Reichardt wrote and directed this triptych of a screenplay set in Montana, based on a collection of short stories by Maile Meloy. Reichardt is known for slow-moving plots and prefers character studies to fill out her often lugubrious narratives. In each of the three segments that constitute Certain Women, Reichardt's protagonists are women who attempt to maintain a quiet dignity despite being stifled by people devoted to blocking their self-actualization.

In the first segment, Laura Dern plays attorney Laura Wells who is unable to shake off disgruntled client Fuller (Jared Harris), who seeks to re-open a civil suit but has been informed by both Laura and her attorney colleague that he has no legal leg left to stand on. When Fuller takes a security guard hostage at his former place of employment, Laura is called in by the local police to act (in the unlikely scenario) as hostage negotiator. When Fuller lets the security guard go and asks Laura to give him a head start as he scurries out of the back of the building, Laura immediately informs the police of Fuller's whereabouts, and he's placed under arrest.

In the second and least successful of the segments, Michelle Williams plays Gina who is married to Ryan (James Le Gros). Gina is constantly annoyed with her husband who appears to indulge their rebellious teenage daughter. Gina has placed herself in charge of building a new family home out in a rural areaall she has to do is convince Albert, an elderly family acquaintance, to part with the sandstone on his property which she would like to use in the construction of the new home. Albert tentatively agrees to selling the sandstone and soon afterward, Gina's workers come to take possession of it. But when Gina waves to him as her stares out the window from his home, he doesn't react. Did Gina intimidate him into doing something he didn't really want to do? This is perhaps the only real ambiguity in Reichardt's "what you see is what you get" narrative.

The third segment features Jamie (Lily Gladstone), a young Native American ranch hand, who stumbles upon a continuing education class on educational law taught by attorney Beth Travis (Kristen Stewart). Beth amazingly travels four hours each way to teach the class and Jamie ends up taking an immediate liking towards the moonlighting attorney. Soon afterward they go out to eat a couple of times at a greasy spoon but eventually Beth fails to show up at the class, much to Jamie's chagrin. Jamie discovers that Beth stopped teaching because she could no longer tolerate the travel time.

Jamie decides to make the four hour drive to see if she can find Beth. When she finally tracks Beth down, they have a brief conversation but nothing comes of it. Lonely Jamie makes the trek back to the farm. End of segment.

Certain Women is very loosely interconnected by a few plot strands. Laura has been having an affair with Gina's husband, and Beth happens to be employed in the same building where Laura works. 

If you can't stand lugubrious plots, Certain Women is an immediate "no-go." In terms of character development (the area where Reichardt is supposed to shine), that part of the narrative is also exceptionally weak. None of the three protagonists has much of a discernible internal arc, except maintaining the aforementioned "quiet dignity." One wonders what to think of Laura and Ginatheir egos are intact and they seem to accomplish their goalsdespite the obstacles put in their way (in Laura's case, it's resolving her "bad client" problem; with Gina it's consummating the sale of the sandstone and moving ahead in spite of her husband and daughter's "bad attitude"). Yet nothing much happens except for the quiet satisfaction of weathering a few not very dramatic opponents.

The case of Jamie is a bit different. She's the only protagonist who doesn't get what she wants, and is perhaps the only "sad sack" of the three. Sad sacks unfortunately don't make for good drama so when Jamie arrives back home, we're forced to revel in her failure.

If you must see Certain Women, see it for the plush Montana landscapes and the capable acting on the part of the principals. Unfortunately, good parts for women in the cinema today remain hard to come by. Certain Women certainly fails to contribute to such a pantheon.

The story is split between three characters. There is Laura Wells (Laura Dern) who is a lawyer for this man named Will Fuller (Jared Harris) who is just a miserable man thanks to a work accident. Alongside her is Gina Lewis (Michelle Williams) who is a woman who, with her husband, owns a company and they are trying to acquire sandstone from a man named Albert (Rene Auberjonois). Lastly, there is Jamie (Lily Gladstone) and Beth (Kristen Stewart).

Jamie is a young woman who takes care of horses, keeps to herself, and doesn't seem to have much in the way of friends. Beth is a young woman who is a lawyer who, through reasons not fully explained, ends up teaching a class on school law in the town Jamie works in. Jamie enjoys her company and Beth mostly is just cordial.

Highlights

I think every now and then a person should really see a movie which isn't trying to be over the top with the dramatics. For a lack of a better way of putting it, it cleans your palate. It helps you appreciate the lives people live, whether characters or real people, and how even the one or two odd connections we have can mean so much to someone. 

For whether it is Laura and Will, Gina and Albert, or Jamie and Beth, one of the things this film highlights is one-half of each set being lonely and may not outright say they are craving attention, camaraderie, or someone to listen, but their actions speak volumes. Mind you, not to the point of crying or bawling your eyes out, but without anything being over the top, it pushes you to really pay attention to find something to grasp onto.

Low Points

With that said, this film was honestly boring as hell. I can try to make it seem like more than it is by speaking on how it focuses on the loneliness of life in parts of Montana but, at the end of the day, everyone is a square peg. For while Will can be slightly erratic, demanding, and likes reminding you how much of a victim he is, no one is really trying to engage him. They talk to him, but there aren't any passionate speeches or stories which make you care about what is going on in his life.

Same goes for everyone else. Albert is old and seemingly coming to the beginning of that point where he may need someone to check on him every now and then. Then with Jamie, she is a nice quiet girl who needs a friend that isn't a farm animal. Each story is sad in its own way and may make you think how luckily you are to have the connections you do have, but everything is so subtle and subdued that I think the appeal will be limited.

Perhaps the worst movie I have seen. Granted there is a great cast of interesting actors, which piqued my interest and is the primary the reason I had higher expectations and was so disappointed. However, it's not the acting that makes this movie terrible, the acting is fine. It's the story line, or lack thereof, that makes this movie a real dud. What was the point? Three loosely connected stories featuring women with mundane lives. There is no sound track, the cinematography is bleak and mediocre, the character development is practically non-existent and the ending leaves you flat and empty feeling. It truly was a waste of $12 and 2 hours of my time. With the myriad of movies to choose from, do yourself a favor and pick something else.

Kelly Reichardt knows how to use a camera. Problem is, she only uses it for filming, not for telling a story. Doesn't help that she chooses non stories to tell. Or is that not to tell?

My wife and I have tried hard with her films, but after this dismal effort we've placed an embargo upon all her future work. Enough's enough.

The long, dull, opening scenic shot of barren land and a train rolling in sets the dross tone of the film and everything in it.

Ironically, despite the title, the only interesting character and trace of story is in Jared Harris' character.

The episodes/vignettes that comprise this film aren't enough to fill a bad 30 minute TV slot. There's simply nothing there, and nothing told.

What you do get, are endless scenes watching people doing nothing: Like someone driving, or feeding animals, or just looking at nothing. Scenes that have simply nothing to say  at least not of any interest.

But you'll also get what are nothing more than 'stills': Like a shot of an empty room AFTER someone's left.

Anyone can point a camera and press record. And that's all you get with this piece from Reichardt. No story. There's nothing special or particular about how she films. It's very much just point and shoot, usually with boring subject matter, and next to no movement.

As writers, we learn that every scene must reveal character and move the story forward. You will see in this film exactly what happens when you don't do that.

Somebody had the poor taste to compare this film to I'm Not a Serial Killer. Absolutely not. And let's not get started on assertions that it's "required viewing."

And like all independent films that are directed by people so entranced by their own sense of magnificence, this film ends abruptly with an unprompted, unmotivated CUT to black in the middle of yet another meaningless scene.

Reichardt's choice of when to end raises the burning question: Why wait for this dull, repetitive, meaningless scene when virtually every scene before it would have served the same point?

What disturbs me most, is that someone thought this was worth funding.

This film tells the stories of three women in rural United States of America, who all have different life experiences which showcase their resilience and toughness in their respective personalities.

"Certain Women" has three stories which are unrelated. The first story is about a female lawyer in a small town, who finds herself in a hostage situation because her client refuses to accept the outcome of his work injury case. This is the most engaging story, as it has a good story line which delivers some suspense and thrill. the second story is about a married woman who wants to get some stone from a neighbour. This story is very slow in pace and is the most uneventful out of the three. The third story is also very slow, but has emotional depth as the student comes to terms with sudden loss. Overall, I find the pace of the film far too slow, making the film unnecessarily long to fill up screen time.

A 5 rating is slightly generous because this film really does very little to capture your interest on anything more than an eyebrow raising level.

The performances and direction are pretty solid as are all the actors, in fact top marks all round here it has to be said. Unfortunately there just is no real substance to the film, and even though a glimmer of redemption always seems lurking in the next scene, it never materialises. It was like watching three totally separate stories inside a twilight zone episode. To say there was an intersection of the three stories is to say there was an intersection of my life with a beggar on the street I threw a few coins to as I walked on by... which is to say, none; certainly of any significance.

That said, I had a few hours to burn and as I watched it I really liked the performances. Each of the stories on its own could have been nicely developed into a full feature and I'm a little sadden that that didn't happen because as a collection within the events as they unfolded, they just didn't adhere well.

I'm a little intrigued about the producer of this film though, as there is an odd depth to this film I still can't put my finger on.

I have to admit I haven't seen an indie movie for a while. It was an interesting movie, though not one that deserves 5/5 as some reviews I've seen stated. The reviews focus on "independent" women is misplaced. More than independent they are disconnected. The stories are almost stills on how disconnected they are. The first is a lawyer who cannot connect with her client tragedy; the second is a woman who wants to build a house but cannot connect neither with her husband and daughter nor with her neighbour (she cannot even connect with the stones in her neighbour garden which she covets for her house); the third story is about a law teacher who cannot connect with one of her students, a young woman living an isolated life taking care of the horses on the family ranch with her dog. The latter would be perhaps the most connected of all if she didn't live in the middle of nowhere.

For now 7/10.

On the face of it, not a great deal appears to happen in this film. But scratch under the surface ever so slightly, and there is a great deal of real life going on.

People have also said that these are three disjointed stories - they are anything but. All three supply massive sub context to one another. The fling we see the lawyer having in the first vignette informs the second story, and our protagonist's increasingly futile search for an individual in the third piece gives us so much of an insight into the lives of others in the whole piece. Three different stories - but the three are inextricably linked.

Add in some stellar performances from a very strong cast, tremendously beautiful and in equal parts brutal cinematography, and a Director who masterfully leads us through the narrative, and you have an utterly compelling (if superficially unspectacular) and stimulating little masterpiece to enjoy.

This movie is worse than "Night Moves" by the same director - Kelly Reichardt. I'm a fan of "Night Moves" - this movie was a big surprise for me. Both movies have some similarities - intelligent, slow-paced, focused on something behind the scenes so you have to decode depending on your common sense however there's a big difference between these two: "Certain Women" doesn't work as "Night Moves" does. 

Three key stories of women didn't catch my attention so I felt myself like I was watching some rough material work for some reason. Movie simply doesn't provide any clues. Is this about feminism? Is this about twists of women's fate? Is this about lesbian love? No answer. I like slow-paced movies of this sort but this one is simply boring and rough bunch of meanings that I can't decode.

I was expecting a silly group of women, cooing about nonsense in Montana. Instead I was delightfully surprised to find 3 well crafted stories with interesting characters who soaked up the screen.

This movie provided a peaceful sadness to the viewer. Beautifully portrayed by the talented main actresses. Not a single redeeming male moment to speak of, other than the dad (who turns out to be a cheater) asking the daughter to be nice to her mother. A very pro women movie to be certain but for the stories it told, things made sense and never felt preachy. Just a sad display of humanity that left you routing for the main actresses to stay hopeful.

Just exceptionally crafted. Pretty fine piece of work. A ton of respect for the work itself.

The most interesting character of this film is undoubtedly the director. And folks, maybe that's how it should be. Kelly Reichardt is now required viewing for me because she has something to say about American life in a way that doesn't trivialize or stupidify our culture and youth. Her past films are equally the same and of mighty caliber. The performances are very much of a Reichardt genre, natural, subtle, about the moments-in-between. And this fine cast excels under her direction.

This is a film I highly recommend. Sit down and take the ride.

Certain Women (2016) was written and directed by Kelly Reichardt. The movie could have been called "Four Women." It's really three separate movies, with nothing connecting them except that they all take place in or near Livingston, Montana. 

In the first episode, Laura Dern plays an attorney who is now saddled with a former client. He has been cheated out of money he deserved as payment for company negligence. The problem is that he has been morally cheated, but not legally cheated. He can't accept this terrible fact. 

The second episode features Michelle Williams (who was born in Montana) as a woman who is working with her husband to build a new vacation home. They approach an older man named Albert (Rene Auberjonois) to obtain stone slabs that he has owned for years but never used. It's clear that Albert has early dementia. He understands what the couple wants, and he says OK, but it's never clear if he grasps exactly what is going on.

In the third episode, Kristen Stewart plays a young lawyer, who works in Livingston, but has taken an extra job teaching educational law to local teachers in a town four hours away. The teachers have no interest in what she is trying to teach them, and she is frustrated because she's making this dangerous and difficult trip and then getting about four hour's sleep before she has to return to work.

Lily Gladstone portrays a Native American woman who works by herself on a lonely horse ranch. I assume there's no one else there because the only living thing we see except for horses is a dog. (Gladstone was born and raised in Montana, so there's another Montana connection.)

She wanders into the class where Stewart is teaching, and develops a very real, very strong connection with the lawyer. It's not clear whether Stewart has any connection with the local woman. That's what makes the plot interesting.

This is a quiet movie. It has some exciting moments, but there's no real violence or action. Each plot spins out in its own way. What makes this movie worth seeing is that each of the four women play their roles very, very well. It's a pleasure to see so much talent in one film.

The scenery in rural Montana is breathtaking, and for that reason the movie will work better if you can find it on the large screen. We saw it at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. If you can't find it at a theater, try to find it on the small screen. Even though it won't work as well, it's still worth seeing.

This film has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.6. It's another film where I have to suggest that you ignore the rating, see the movie, and decide for yourself.

When I saw high reviews for this, my wife & I settled in to be entertained. So we waited, and waited...being from a small town I thought perhaps I could relate. Not many people will "get this" movie. Follow 3 small town people around for a day or two. Exciting? Not at all. Something's gotta happen soon!.....end credits. Pretty much every day life for some of us, nothing exciting, as much drama as watching the neighbor let the dog out...and sometimes that's more interesting than this film was.

Apparently this is one of the director's best works. I'll dust off the cobwebs, and skip those other movies as this was a complete aimless bore. Just one opinion from a speechless movie fan that was waiting to be entertained and would have had more fun watching paint dry. The only people that will find this compelling & entertaining (you have to be pretty damn desperate) is someone who has never lived in a small town, or the Mid-West, and then you probably won't understand it. To think money was spent producing such an empty plate, is beyond me.
