### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Lately the genre of teen comedies skew to the ribald and the are more sex romps than tell stories and introduce characters that you can not only root for but like. "Easy A" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risqué, but heartfelt.

In Emma Stone you have a Molly Ringwald for a new generation: relate-able, sexy, funny, sarcastic and lovely shines as Olive, a girl who leads her best friend (Aly Michalka) to believe she wasn't a virgin. The rumor spreads about her fabled loose ways and spurs different reactions from the school population: Brandon (Dan Byrd) wants to use it to his advantage, Marianne (Amanda Bynes) the school's self-appointed religious leader wants to shame Olive and Olive decides to run with it for her own gains.

There are many pluses with this film: A cast of young actors who are true actors who can convey the humor and uphold the tone of the film; a truly funny, vibrant script by Bert V. Royal in which not only the teens get to be smart and fully fleshed out characters but the adults (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's wry and whimsical parents are a joy; and Thomas Haden Church whose character is a new spin on the "hip teacher".) as well.

With Stone as the lead and the only face in the promotional poster people may think this is a "chick flick" but this film is for anyone who just likes a good film.

I attended a free preview of this movie and without having done any research on the movie and just based on a short synopsis, had pretty low expectations walking into the cinema. It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me, it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!) - it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!

Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.

The only parts that didn't hold up was a couple of logistical things (like a girl that good looking not having any guys following her around, and having a best friend who is such a ditz). All in all though the plot stuck together, was edgy in a few ways, and thoroughly entertaining. I'd put it on the shelf right next to the John Hughes films, and that is a distinguished place indeed.

June 2 2010 - saw advanced preview of "Easy A" tonight. Emma Stone plays sarcasm great in this one, and supporting cast works well with her. Emma also narrates heavily throughout, and though not rolling on the floor funny, this has the feel of a John Hughes film (even makes reference to him in a longing way). Thomas Haden Church is funny as the only teacher we really meet, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are well cast as the understanding and 60's hippy mentality parents. The crowd I saw it with laughed frequently, and there are a lot of "I've been there" or "I've seen that" moments that you can relate to from your own high school. The writing is a little bit above the age - that is to say, you'd be surprised to hear the advanced dialog coming from today's teenagers, but this movie worked for me and those with me. Makes for a fun night at the movies. Scheduled for release Sept 17 2010.

Emma Stone stars as Olive, a lonely heart who lies about losing her virginity to her best friend and soon rumour spreads she is a slut. Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut, wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.

Described as "the best teen comedy since Mean Girls" this is a must see because quite simply, it is. The comedy variety of clever performances, physical humour and beautiful word play make a combination of knockabout comedy a treat for anyone over 15 years of age that will entertain you for a glorious hour and a half.

Emma Stone in her first major leading role excels as a typical but not yet typical teenager going through life's friendship and educational battles, and thankfully with a difference. Olive narrates via an internet blog about how everything came about and her life and school reputation changed. Through some original narrative design and comic brightness audiences are easily engaged into the world of its heroine.

Stone's performance is indescribably funny. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing and making us laugh at the same time has made her a star for the future. One scene where she pretends to have it on in a bedroom is very funny and whilst marketed as a comedy, the inevitable drama sequences show Stone as a rock.

Stone steals the film but thanks to the experience of Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church we have an array of comic genius. Tucci has never been funnier.

The plot boasts some great twists and turns whilst marketing some great songs on its soundtrack. The way it separates itself from the normal comedy, by diversifying itself through visual aids such as the live web blog or plot differentiations makes it one out watch over and over again.

A couple of drawbacks include the fact Lisa Kudrow cannot shake the Phoebe tag and the ending is slightly predictable.

These minor things aside this is a knockabout comedy with a great lead performance that is certainly worth checking out.

Through much of the beginning of "Easy A," you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone, confesses she wants her life to have a "Sixteen Candles" or "Breakfast Club" or "Say Anything" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and surprisingly touching comedy, any time "Easy A" wanders down the path of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it. 

It all begins and ends with Stone, who can do a little bit of everything, which ought to ensure her a long career. She can do typical teen comedy lead autopilot/earn our sympathy, she can command the improvisation-like tangential dry humor that has defined the comedies of the last five or so years and she can be the sensitive, fragile Molly Ringwald type. Nothing feels forced or unnatural in her performance. She seems to be having fun and milking to goofy nature of Royal's script.

More importantly, the reason "Easy A" is so good is because it never stops being about Olive's story. A high school nobody, Olive lets her best friend (Alyson Michalka) pressure her into lying about losing her virginity. The simple lie gets overheard by the super-Christian Miss Everybody (Amanda Bynes) and suddenly everyone sees Olive differently, or sees her period. After deciding to embrace the attention as school slut (the story reaches here a bit), Olive then starts to pretend to have sex with guys in need of a reputation boost, which consequently sullies her own.

The only real problem with "Easy A" is that there's no good reason to believe Stone was this unattractive nobody given her actual attractiveness and the friends she has -- and we're supposed to believe that suddenly everyone is interested in her because she lost her virginity. Gluck tries to spin this into a positive by making it almost comical how everyone is staring at her or waiting in a perfect line for her to come down the hall, but it's the one scratch in this gem -- take it or leave it. The script and humor and situations that arise eventually more than make up for this road bump.

Gluck's filmmaking is hip and common of modern comedy while the writing is clever and spontaneous. For no logical reason, a scene when Olive's gay friend Brandon (the one she helps first) comes over, Stone and Patricia Clarkson, who plays her mother, do this quick exchange of pretending they're in the Old South and a boy has come over and asked for her. Though completely random and a bit forced, they actually work well at making the characters seem more organic, which is the challenge of most comedies, especially those made today.

Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as the parents are the comic relief. When was the last time parents in a teen comedy were genuine comic relief? They walk a fine line between wacko and genuinely caring and loving parents, but it totally works. Two more originally funny parents haven't existed on film before. Characters such as the aforementioned best friend Rhiannon and Bynes' are more by-the-book as far as being teen comedy stencils, but like every other small flaw with the film, they're covered up by all the multi-dimesional and more interesting ones. Worthy of mention are school faculty members played by Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm MacDowell.

Most intriguing of all is how the film actually succeeds at finding moments of genuine drama. A few well-thought-out and creative plot twists introduce an intelligence seemingly foreign to these kinds of comedies. The key once again comes from staying focused on Olive's story. The film is structured as a retelling with narration from Olive, so it's told in a reflective manner, which ultimately keeps it from veering off course. It's about Olive wrestling with this lie and her feelings about how she wants to be perceived, along with her understandable pity for the boys who request her "services." High school's rough and reputation seems to be everything. Some elements of the high-school experience in "Easy A" might be way off, but that's dead on.

Although it lacks the intangible innocence of the numerous '80s comedies it references, "Easy A" has a unique and lively spirit of its own and is the best teen comedy (at least featuring a female, finally!) in years. More importantly, it shows that the modern teenage sense of humor and good storytelling don't have to be mutually exclusive.

It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive (Emma Stone). Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone, and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway, Olive, without thinking things through, starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast, which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school, one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously, the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here, Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain, as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid, but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.

First off, the dialouge of Easy A is surprisingly great for a film set around these kinds of teenage archetypes. It is much more intelligent sophisticated than the typical pandering you hear coming out of the mouths of teenagers. It adds a whole new level of respect to the film that keeps it very lively and fresh. But the dialouge isn't cocky, thankfully, and I never got the sense the writer was trying boast his wide vocabulary. He went a totally different route, and used it to the advantage of more characterization. Olive is much smarter than her peers and her language reflects that. There are plenty of other characters in the film that obviously don't come close to her sophisticated insight into the world and are the true bimbos and airheads. Their dialouge is much more typical of a teenager, and it reflects a very distinct level of characterization that had hilarious results. Needless to say I felt much smarter watching this film than some of the other crap I've subjected myself to in recent years.

Easy A also has a great variety of characters. Olive is already a very fun character who leads the story perfectly, keeping it interesting all the way through. But then there are other characters like Amanda Bynes as Marianne, the Christian nut job of the school. It's obvious to see where a person who boasts about premarital sex versus a religious zealot is leading, and these two characters are hilarious to watch interact with all their snappy and quick witted dialouge. The male roles are arguably the weakest of the film, but its not as big of a deal when the whole story primarily focuses on the social interactions between high school girls. Gossip is obviously a huge part of the story. But apart from the younger cast the older cast also fall into some hilarious roles. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci play Olive's parents and there isn't a moment with these two on screen that you aren't laughing your head off. This duo plays off each other so well and it makes for some of the most hysterical scenes of the whole film. Then there are other great adults in the film like Thomas Haden Church as the fast talking and sarcastic English teacher who you can't help but love. Malcolm McDowell even cameos as the school's principal and has a couple of short but funny scenes. Overall you couldn't ask for a more fitting and entertaining cast.

Overall, Easy A doesn't provide anything groundbreaking or revolutionary to the comedy genre, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air that keeps my hopes alive for the comedy genre in this age where there are so many god awful comedies being released. Easy A isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The story sort of becomes a mess towards the end and it seems to be going off on a lot of random tangents. And then it is all resolved rather simplistically for how all over the place it was. I also have to say that the moral compass of all these characters, especially Olive, is pretty out of wack. Some of the decisions are a little strange and seem ridiculous at times, but I guess it only reflects the naivety of a teenager, and how much we still have to learn. But overall you can't complain too much when you are delivered an overall satisfying and hilarious experience.

According to Emma Stone's Olive, "A is for Awesome." "Easy A" is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" in this Twitter Age is whimsical, genuine, and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists, and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. "Easy A" is reminiscent of "Juno" in its clever and biting dialog. Where in "Juno" no one in real life actually speaks with those razor-like smarts, "Easy A" is witty and sharp in natural speak.

Stone's Olive is a smart ass, but never over the top. She is the straight man, self-aware of the social "no win" she finds herself imprisoned. During the staged fake tryst, Olive (Stone) locks herself with Brandon (exasperated funny Dan Byrd) in a friend's bedroom. Brandon is gay and tormented everyday at school for just being. Olive reluctantly agrees to this public staging to recreate his reputation anew. When Olive removes her thong as part of the theatrics, Brandon freaks. Olive says, "Do you think I have a gnome down there?" Brandon defends that she is not his type. Duh. Olive surmises could it be: "I have a V, not a P." Gluck and Royal orchestrate hysterically. Stone has natural impeccable timing. "Easy A" had won me over at this juncture.

Olive is a smart and decent high school student in Ojai, CA. She is never in trouble in fact nearly invisible. Olive gets caught in a lie, to avoid going on a camping trip with her BFF Rhiannon (charmingly spacey Aly Michalka) and her disturbing New Age parents. Olive tells Rhi that she had a one night stand with a college freshman over the weekendreally she was comically alone at home. School Christian Crusade Leader Marianne (gloriously bitchy Amanda Bynes) overhears Olive's restroom confession. Literally at the speed of light Tweets and texts broadcast Olive's promiscuity. Later Marianne tells Olive she will be judged by a higher power. Olive responds, "Did I just get saved?" 

"Easy A" opens with Olive's webcast, which is genius. She confesses, "There are 2 sides to every story. This is my sidethe right one." Olive's good intentions to resuscitate social outcasts by "fake rocking their worlds" soon make her a pariah. She is getting Auto Zone gift cards to have faux sex with boys seeking credibility. Olive's favorite teacher Mr. Griffith (disguised aloof Thomas Hayden Church) becomes concerned when she transforms, and wears bus tiers emblazoned with the scarlet letter A. She is reading "The Scarlet Letter" in English class. Also worried is Griffith's Guidance Counselor wife (wacky Lisa Kudrows). Olive's parents note the red flags. Her Mom (wonderfully loopy Patricia Clarkson) remarks that she looks like a stripper-- albeit "high end" according to her Dad (hysterically wise Stanley Tucci).

However, on a transactional date Olive realizes that someone crossed the whore line. Fortunately, "Lobster" Todd rescues her. Todd (gentle and strong Penn Badgley) says he dismisses the rumors about Olive. He always remembers the beautiful 7th grader, who was kind to him. Olive too has always been in love Todd, since then. This is the distinguishing charm of "Easy A". Although Olive is in the adolescent abyss, the people that know her soul like Todd and her parents have faith in her. In a hilarious dinner scene Olive requests that her parents dismiss the rumors of Chlamydiaapparently no big deal. Even her Dad tells her vehemently and comically, "I would take a bullet for you." Her Mom understands completely. While gazing at the stars she tells her daughter that when she too was young she slept with a lot of people"mostly guys".

"Easy A" poignantly captures and reminds us of the painful teen angst of fitting in, and just being allowed to be. When overweight dweeb Evan (sympathetic Jameson Moss) begs Olive to say that she had sex with him, she asks him why? Brandon says, "Just look at me." You can see the heartbreak in Stone's visage. While Olive is confronted by picketers, Todd tells her, "Screw all these people, Olive!" Ultimately, "Easy A" gets an "A" for its story about having the courage to take a stand, doing what is right despite what people think. Emma Stone is our hero on this journey. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit. She wins us over whether she is singing "Pocket Full of Sunshine" in the shower or seeing the suffering in her eyes when she realizes that she shattered the life of someone dear. "Easy A" is one of the best movies of the year. It's the kind of movie that is dismissed by the Academy, when it shouldn't. Perhaps, one day.

Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.

Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart, "invisible" girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.

Emma Stone ("Zombieland", "The House Bunny") delivers a star-making performance as Olive. Forced into a faux-confession by her best friend, Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her "V card". Even though this one is based in Ojai, California, it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel, The Scarlet Letter.

This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts, led by Amanda Bynes, take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time, the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.

While she is presented as a very sharp-witted, well-grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her free-spirited, yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.

I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached, but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy, Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher, Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor (in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen).

Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick. It is instead an insightful comedy that plays well for adults and teens. While you may not agree with all of the social observations, I believe you will agree the film is presented in a most entertaining and insightful manner.

Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks, and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had, and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good (a re-working of The Scarlett Letter, which the film unashamedly references and possibly over-references).

However, the main problems are ultimately fundamental flaws in the script. Olive (the smoking hot Emma Stone) is too cool. She's too self- assured, and too smart. It doesn't have the authenticity of teen life, unlike Mean Girls which had it in spades. Olive wasn't the cynical outsider the role called for; she was the confident adult narrator. Films that portray the hero coming out stronger at the end work for a reason, but the character was the same throughout.

The end of the film is a love story and fixes everything in only a few scenes, but it's tacked on, and felt contrived. The core of the film is the 'Scarlett Letter' concept, and it's a clever concept, but it kind of got muddled anywhere outside that. Olive's character didn't really suffer any great despair (at least the drew any empathy), so the ending (where she miraculously found love in about 5 minutes) was more a marriage of convenience than one of passion.

Overall, it was a strong film. Very confident, witty and well-paced. At the end though, it was just souless. No real losses or triumphs, no character development. Olive was just as smart and self-confident at the beginning as she was at the end. The audience didn't cheer Olive through the rough times because there weren't any that felt rough. We didn't really care that she hooked up with a decent guy at the end, as that subplot was woefully malnourished and not given any real development time.

Commercially? Okay. Artistically? Disappointing. It could have been the next Clueless or Mean Girls, but kind of wasted it's potential.

Worth seeing if there'e not much else on, and definitely worth seeing for Emma Stone in tiny blue shorts.

In California, the virgin student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) feels anonymous in the high school where she studies. When her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. 

Meanwhile, Olive is studying "The Scarlet Letter" in the English class and she identifies herself like Hester Prynne, the woman condemned by her Puritan neighbors in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel. Olive discloses the truth to her bullied gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) and suggests him to also lie that he had slept with a girl. Brandon asks Olive to help him and she pretends to have sex with him in a party. Then other outcast boys offer to pay Olive to improve their images while Olive's reputation degrades. When Olive loses control of the situation, she needs to take an attitude to revert it.

"Easy A" is a delightful comedy about an average teenager that is on the spot of her high school mates after telling a lie about an encounter with a fictitious boyfriend. The plot has flaws and some attitudes of Olive are unreasonable. Despite this remark, I loved this film, mainly because the sensual Emma Stone and her sexy voice. My vote is seven.

Olive decides that she's tired of being a 'Virgin' and makes up lies that she has lost her virginity to a boy...But then she makes the mistake of saying that she has slept with a fellow friend to help him from being bullied in school...and soon it seems that all the boys in school want her to do the same.

I thought the plot was quite intriguing from what I saw in the trailer, I thought that Olive was making up stories in order to get A's, but it was not..Instead what I got was a lame comedy that does not know what it wants to be. At first I thought Olive was quite clever, but she doesn't seem to understand the repercussions of her actions. People try to pass this off as intelligent...but I didn't see any of that.

There are a few meagre laughs but its not for me...And I felt that Christians were portrayed badly...I am not a Christian but why does Hollywood have to portray any group of people continuously through stereotypes?

EASY A  CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!

Noble effort to make a movie with a questionably helpful message. I did enjoy the movie somewhat, but a few nagging things kept distracting me from really liking the movie. I will attempt to elaborate: 

1) Aryan High. This did not look like a public school...more like a junior private college for jocks, models and cheer-leaders. I recommend the next time Hollywood makes a high-school movie with a contemporary setting, they actually GO IN one. The kids in this school did not look, OR ACT like kids in any contemporary public school I've ever seen. The plot may have been more successful in a 1950's setting. Promiscuity is not a major concern in today's public high-schools. And they weren't in the 80's, which is when I went. Either you were having sex or wanting to or thinking about it. No one was decried for having done it, or talking about it, or, for that matter bragging about it. Even girls. Granted, the girls were more discreet. On the contrary though, in today's schools you might just get more cred by claiming to be a virgin...especially if attractive like the main protagonist in this story. 

2) Somewhat related to the last topic...if making a high-school movie...make it with kids that at least look like they're in high school. It's ironic and hypocritical that a minor plot-point in this movie is a student that's 21 years old and sleeps with a teacher, when ALL the students look like they're in their early 20's. It's about time the ticket-buying public make an issue out of this. I think it's humorous when watching noir movies today like "Grease" and the actors all look as old as the teachers. I guess today's movie-makers aren't worried about the future "snicker-factor" that might hinder a potential classic, otherwise they'd put more thought into it. I understand the pool of young acting talent is limited...but they are out there. Bust your butt and find 'em. It'll pay off in the long run...and you may just find the next hot star. Oh, and your movie budget might just be more palatable.

3) They hypocritical Christian. If you're going to portray a hypocritical Christian, why not go and meet one? Make the character realistic and believable. I know they're a caricature, but the girl in this movie was portrayed WAY over the top. Really. It kept me from rating this movie higher. I mean, if I was to make a movie with a German, I WOULDN'T give him a swastika arm band and a Hitler mustache...too cliché. Put a little effort into make your characters at least a little realistic.

I know, I know...this is an exceptionally harsh review. I did like the movie and felt bad I couldn't enjoy it more. I thought the message, being comfortable in your own skin, was positive...but done way better with movies like "Napoleon Dynamite". A little thought could've made this movie a much more enjoyable experience.

I am honestly surprised to see the good reviews that this movie has been getting. I found it to completely lack direction or logic. The characters were hardly likable or even realistic; and I think the message it sends is not a particularly good one to send to the clearly intended younger audience. Not a fan.

As an observation, I noted a fair amount of Christianity bashing, through the use of exaggerated stereotypes and stepping on a Bible. Some of it came off as a bit obvious and overdone.

I do think Emma Stone is a talent actress, however. Given her age and good looks, I think she will have a strong career in film. I like her better in her more adult oriented roles though.

I think this is one of the best movies of the decade. Emma Stone is awesome and such a great actress. The story is impressive and super truthful to American's high school current reality. The Story: Olive Penderghast is a normal high school student just trying to "blend in the crowd". At some part, she says she lost her virginity to a boy in community college and everyone starts to call her a "dirty skank". Then, she starts dressing like one and pretending to have sex for money. This girl just wants to find true love but anybody would ask her out. The movie ends in a high note with a precious lesson: don't worry about what the others say about you. Just live your life. Such a great movie. I do really recommend it. :) :)

Yeah it was pretty bad and hopelessly overrated too, I just watched it then came online immediately to comment. Nobody is gonna look back on this clichéd, heavily stereotyped, unfunny farce 10 years from now and say oh! wow! It's now a classic like the greater movies of the same genre from the 70s and 80s. Too much of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. That high school was more like a resort than a school and none of the kids looked like teenagers, they all looked like super-duper seniors. I respect Aly Mischalka for taking such a blink and you'll miss her role, I would be embarrassed too if I had been presented with such a lame script about nothing that addresses and resolves nothing. Pretty girl can't get dates so she pretends to be a floozy to get the attention of all the guys in her school...ugh! Okay. With so many jokes about other epic literary works, better films and stellar acting you would think that Easy A was about to take it to the next level but unfortunately it all falls flat about halfway through and follows the cliché of other similar movies rather than be the different film everybody expected it would be. Nothing new here people, same script, different cast.

I first saw this movie a couple of weeks ago at a friends house. I didn't think it looked good enough to wait ten dollars on at the movie theater, and so glad I didn't. where to start?... it was awful! First of all this would never happen in high school, teachers and faculty would never allow it. I know Olive was trying to dress like a slut but maybe she could have found some cuter slutty clothes. Word does travel fast around school about rumors. But people really don't care that much about someone's sex life. The movie was way too exaggerated on the scenes with the rumors. One thing i did like was the little surprise that Mrs. Griffith was sleeping with the student Micah.

I don't normally watch modern teen comedies, in fact almost never, but a very good cast (a rarity these days) attracted me to this movie, and by that I mean Emma Stone and the adult i.e. older actors (apart from Lisa "Friends" Kudrow). I should have known better. I understand that this is just a mindless teen comedy, but even the lowest-common denominator genres have to subscribe to some level of basic logic and ground rules.

1. Stone gets called an "abominable tramp" during English class, to which she responds by calling the other girl an "abominable tw*t". And yet Stone is the only one that gets sent to the principle's office. Duh. 2. Right off the bat Stone is presented to us as a teen of above-average intelligence (which admittedly isn't saying much). In fact, as is typical in these movies, she is given lines of a middle-aged man with 5 university degrees, AND she is full of 5-cent movie "wisdom". And yet she agrees to the gay guy's preposterous plea to pretend to have sex with him even though that would clearly only make her phony reputation as an easy lay even worse. We were given to understand that Emma wasn't enjoying that reputation too much, so why the decision? The reason: just so the writer of this lame script could advance his shaky plot. The poor sap couldn't think of a logical way of doing this, so he chose an illogical plot-device. Nice going. 3. "Everyone claimed they slept with me, but no-one really bothered to actually sleep with me." (Stone) That's about as dumb as it gets. If your comedy has absolutely zero basis in reality than very little in it will be funny, it's that simple. 4. The writer, probably some middle-aged male, simply projected himself onto Emma's character, a teen, and the result is a girl that doesn't appear even 1% believable, at any point in the movie.

Not to mention casting an incredibly geeky, ugly girl to play Emma Stone as a 12 year-old. If only it was meant to be funny, but it wasn't.

One of the more annoying aspects of EA were Stone's parents, played by Tucci and Clarkson. Always cracking wise, their totally unrealistic hip-understanding-always-cheerful-intelligent-parents shtick gets old very quickly, as does their almost clownish behaviour. But that's the problem of the whole movie: nothing here has an ounce of realism hence it's hard to either care for the characters or laugh at the gags that seem to get increasingly formulaic as the time drags on (and on).

Mocking "Jesus freaks" is too easy, it's been done so often by Hollywood by now it's hardly interesting anymore. Besides, didn't "Monty Python's Life of Brian" teach Americans how to do religious satire properly? That must have gone way over their empty heads. These Christian gags are so lame they were more than cringe-worthy.

But what could one expect? This director calls up on John Hughes as a major filmic inspiration. But just as "The Breakfast Club" cannot be enjoyed by anyone older than 18, the same might be true for EA too. (Admittedly, "Ferris Bueler's Day Off" shouldn't be enjoyed or watched by anyone, regardless of sex or age.) Even more embarrassing is that after all the cardboard, utterly absurd characters and goings-on that EA offers us, suddenly they give us Emma Stone CRYING  as if one hour into this goofy mess we can possibly take anything "dramatic" that occurs here even half-way seriously. Double-duh. You don't create a cheese-ball comedy environment but then suddenly expect the viewer to take the characters seriously  well, you don't if you're a writer with any amount of common sense.

Predictable and obligatory left-wing political correctness is sprayed all over this turkey: the usual pro-gay stuff, "the only thing that trumps religion is Capitalism" (Stone), Florida being commended for voting for Obama, the school's principal being labeled a "Fascist" because he doesn't believe in liberally-orientated New Age BS education systems, a black kid being adopted by Tucci and Clarkson, "the Civil War was just about racism" (Stone), etc. The whole left-wing movie propaganda alphabet, it's all here. Yes, even in a daft teen comedy. They never let up. Ironically, that makes them just as persistent and self-righteous as the "Jesus freaks" they mock here with such childish gusto. (When are American liberals finally going to smell the roses and realize that religion and their precious Marxism are just two sides of the same smelly coin?) 

In the end, were it not for Emma Stone being present in nearly every scene, EA could have easily been an unwatchable bomb with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's a pity her films so far have been nearly all garbage. The fact that she seems to be a rising star in Hollywood only means her roles will get even worse. Watch her lift an Oscar in an overrated costume drama, a left-wing propaganda thriller, or a drama about a woman with no legs.

On second thought, no. Oscars are awarded nearly always to homely women with nepotist ties.

I have seen this movie countless times and can say that it easily goes into the category of my favorite movies of all time. I am a huge fan of John Hughes and his classic 80's teen comedies, to me this just felt like another one of these with a modern twist and a storyline that more can relate to these days. It had a great cast, director and extremely well written script. The story follows Olive who tells a lie about something very personal and it spreads like wildfire through the school. She loses her friends and decides she no longer cares what people think about her. The movie told through a web-cam point of view and is accompanied by a soundtrack full of classic songs, many of which were featured in John Hughes' movies.

"Easy A" starts off OK for about 10-15 min of the runtime but degenerates into trashy reprehensible mockery. Watching a bunch of 20-somethings parade around a fictitious high school as utterly unconvincing high school students with ADD, false-religion, and zeal fails at being a farce. The rip-offs from older and better done "teen" and John Hughes movies litters this movie and signals it's bereavement of ideas. Particularly awful are decent full-aged and experienced adult actors as parents reduced to mocking child-buddies especially Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. For example in several scenes, you have Clarkson giving inappropriate WAY over-the-top sex talks with her high school daughter, lead Emma Stone. This movie is a sad example of supposed aimed parody that utterly fails. Stay away or if you have to pick it up at the library.

... makes for a once in a lifetime film. Forget all that stuff about bringing the Scarlet Letter into modern times. It's noise. Pay attention to the fact that, despite the major success of this film, Emma Stone (who was technically in her 20s when this was filmed and therefore "playing younger") has no aspirations to become a teen idol nor get her own Disney show. What makes this film special -- aside from a script to die for and a superb portrayal by Stone, showing no strain whatsoever under the burden of dual duty, that is, both acting and doing a first person narrative, like Bogey in a filme noire -- is the simple fact that Stone will not be reprising this role (or anything similar) in either her lifetime or yours. And that is special. That's makes this film not only a one-of but also one of the best "smart comedies" ever, irregardless of age or audience.

Being a teenage girl is no easy task, believe me. In Jr. High I had a boyfriend and the first thing on young teenage minds is the curiosity if there is sex in the relationship, fun rumors began to spread and it was one of the worst times in my life. Funny enough, this isn't something that just started when I was a child, or my older sister or my mother or my grandmother. Girl's reputations have always been fragile since the beginning of time, even Shakespeare knew when he wrote Much Ado About Nothing. The Scarlet Letter challenged the double edged sword of how if a man sleeps with a woman, he's a pimp, a lady's man, or just simply "the Man". If a woman sleeps with a man, she doesn't get as kind treatment, we get the names "slut", "whore", or "tramp". No matter how much you know it's the truth that you're not those names, it hurts. But what if a girl actually took pride in those names and love the attention she got, even if it was too rough to handle? Emma Stone proving that she's leading lady material handles herself extremely well in this terrific re-imaging of The Scarlet Letter for teenagers that will prove to be more positive and every pre-adult lady should watch.

Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast just wants to be popular. So much so that when her best friend, Rhiannon, asks Olive how her weekend went, she decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne, and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith, is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife, the school counselor, is in full agreement. As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.

I think this is a very important film for girls because unfortunately this generation doesn't read as much as they should, plus as much as I loved the book The Scarlet Letter, it wouldn't appeal to everyone. We need a new update to grab someone's interest and I was really impressed with the way the cast and crew handled this film. Emma Stone has a lot of charisma, such maturity for a young lady and she carried herself so well. She even provides comic relief to give the drama little break. Same with Amanda Bynes, almost taking on the character played by Mandy Moore in Saved as the "holier than thou" bible thumper who feels that if you have sex before marriage, your soul is damned. Even Lisa Kudrow did a great job, as a high school counselor who puts Olive in a bad situation blaming Olive for her crime and you are just in shock and feel total sympathy for Olive when she realizes that her reputation is destroying her mentally. Easy A provides great education for both teens and adults(parents or soon to be parents) on how hard it can be to be a teenage girl. I wish that I had a film like this when I was 13 because I would have felt a lot better knowing that a lot of girls go through the same thing where you feel so hated for doing something that you didn't do. Easy A is easily one of the year's best films and I'm very happy with the way it was handled, very classy, sexy and funny, I would highly recommend it.

This movie is highly overrated, I found it unwatchable, it tried to be Juno, but the story, writing and characters are so poor that it's not even close. I guess I have hard time believing a teenager could be the smartest person in the room all the time. I know teenagers, most of them don't have a clue. As for Emma stone being cast as a misfit, big mistake. Her parents come across as cartoon characters, totally unbelievable in my eyes. Stanley tucci is unbearable as her dad. Has all the typical Hollywood stereotypes, the hypocritical Jesus freaks, the misunderstood gay kid in the closet, and the slut that's really all talk. This movie was a complete waste of time, more annoying then entertaining. Don't waste your time.

I was talked into watching this movie, due to its charm value. Emma Stone's hotness also did not deter me. Regardless, sitting through this movie I was bored out of my mind. There was no real struggle to be had, it seemed to mostly be some valley girl drama fest where the main character was the catalyst for her "struggle". If the purpose of the movie was to make the viewer feel sympathy for her, it simply was not a reasonable goal in my eyes. This movie seemed to be another one lost in the grouping of "hip movies for awkward teenagers to seem trendy". I would highly suggest saving your money and your time on something more profitable and enjoyable, like passing a kidney stone or volunteer for training K9 units.
