### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
My wife and I (in our 50s) went to see this with my parents (75 and 80). Mom was sorry to see it end. Yes, this is a movie that will appeal to an older crowd, especially if you have children or are divorced, and it's unfortunate that the younger sect will likely ignore it. It presents a very accurate perspective on parenting, especially as a divorced couple, and relationships at an older age. The dialog and portrayals of events/situations was very realistic and interesting enough to hold my attention.

It would benefit each generation to see movies that realistically address a different generation, to give us all a better perspective of life in general. I personally think I'd have enjoyed this movie even in my 20s, but in my 50s, I loved it. So did those in attendance with me. Makes you a little sad to know James G. won't be around to do more work of this quality.

Considering that James Gandolfini is dead now and we'll never get any more from him I would have seen this movie if it was a $300 million bankbuster about a drunk Indian with a dead bird on his head. Thankfully it wasn't.

You never really know how good an actor is until you see him (or her) do something completely different than what you're used to. Gandolfini was incredible in this role, making you forget Tony Soprano or anything else he's done. He completely loses himself in the role.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I haven't seen since Seinfeld so I'm not as familiar with all her talents but this character definitely wasn't Elaine Bennis. 

If you're tired of all the schlock Hollywood has been pumping out the past couple years and would just like some good old fashioned entertainment then this is the movie to see.

When I see a film and are still thinking about the characters the next day, I know I liked it."Enough Said" is one of those films..

A quality script that the all star cast brings to the highest level. The dialogue is so subtle, intimate and at times evasive that I could easily see the work on a stage. It has a modern day Pinteresque quality to it! The bitter sweet note is that as James Gandolfinos' last role, before his untimely death, it is his best. It seems like he was just starting to feel his potential as a diverse actor and "Albert" is a character we have never seen him in. Julia Louis- Dreyfus continues to amaze us with her portrayal of "Eva", a California single mom masseuse. I have always enjoyed her work especially in "Veep" but I think we will be delightfully surprised in the future with the range of characters she creates. Catherine Keener and Toni Collette who I would watch and listen to read a phone book, round out the cast. Go see it if you are in the mood for a "grown-up" film. Enjoy!

I saw this movie this past weekend, when it FINALLY made it to a local theater. The fact that I found a lot of kinship with Julia Louis Dreyfus' character helped push it up a notch or two. Like her character, I'm a divorcée, and my only child, a boy, went off to college this past August. Fortunately, I'm not as needy, and would never think of inviting one of his (younger) friends to live with me after he went off to school. :-) All in all, very realistic dialog (it's not easy dating in your 40s/50s), and I think this captured an empty-nester's mindset very well. Great acting by all, but James Galdofini's performance as Albert was charming and bittersweet.

The unusual thing about this story is that it is about a woman between two people; not two lovers as one might expect but her boyfriend and his ex wife with whom they are friends and this ex wife cannot stop dishing the former husband her current friend is dating.

Another dilemma this woman is facing is the fact that her current boyfriend whom she has come to really like, is 'flabby' as she refers to him and on this matter I am pleased that Hollywood is raising this issue. Do overweight people deserve to be loved? This woman clearly was very hesitant due to the fact that he is overweight and could not fully express her affection becoming torn in the process between the poison spouted by his ex wife as well as expecting her circle to approve of him.

Interesting, intelligent and heart warming would perhaps be a fitting finale to the great James Gandolfini.

ENOUGH SAID is quite simply wonderful. Its plot is straightforward: a middle-aged woman (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) falls in love with a divorced middle-aged man (James Gandolfini). However the course of true love never runs smoothly, as the woman also becomes friends with the man's ex-wife. This ultimately leads to trouble. Within that straightforward plot, director Nicole Holofcener obtains two absolutely wonderful central performances. Dreyfus doesn't want to fall in love, yet finds herself inexorably drawn towards Gandolfini's shy yet bear-like personality. Physically imposing, he has a basic insecurity both about himself and his relationship with the two women in his life, his ex-wife and his daughter (Eve Hewson). Photographed amid the suburban sprawl of California, Holofcener explores the cracks underlying life behind the closed doors and immaculately manicured gardens. While the plot might seem familiar, the performances redeem the film, which is truly bitter- sweet and spell-binding. This was Gandolfini's last film before his untimely death; it stands as a fitting epitaph to a wonderful actor.

Earlier this year we lost James Gandolfini. Although he already left a rich legacy with The Sopranos, it felt like he still had more to give us. I saw an interview with Julia Louis-Dreyfus yesterday and while she put on a brave face, when asked about Gandolfini, you could tell how deeply saddened he was by his death. Good thing that Enough Said is such a joyous and light- hearted film despite inevitably destined to be associated with his death. I'm a fan of The Sopranos and I've never really watched or liked Seinfeld, but it's a genius idea to pair these two actors up in such off-type roles. There was a huge goofy grin on my face when they were on screen together. They shed those past screen images with surprising ease and reveal effortless human beings. That's the beauty in their performances. It's incredibly funny at times and quietly poignant in others. But it's a gentle film in its very casual visual approach and lack of emotionally explosive scenes. Unfortunately the subplots really bog the film down. They don't add to the film's point and are just not up to the same quality. The daughter subplot is the only one close but it wasn't focused enough. However, Enough Said is still a very charming film with a mature look at adult love and second chances.

'ENOUGH SAID': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) James Gandolfini (in one of his last film roles) co-stars with Julia Louis-Dreyfus in this romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. Holofcener also helmed such critically acclaimed movies as 2010's 'PLEASE GIVE', 2006's 'FRIENDS WITH MONEY' and 2001's 'LOVELY & AMAZING'. This film also co-stars Catherine Keener (a usual player in Holofcener's movies), Toni Collette and Ben Falcone. I think it's one of Gandolfini's best and most likable performances and Louis-Dreyfus has never been better or more lovable as well. Fans of honest and real romantic comedies should be more than pleased.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus stars as Eva, a divorced massage therapist who is not looking forward to her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway), going away to college. She goes to a party with her friend Sarah (Collette), and Sarah's husband Will (Falcone), and meets Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is a divorced father who's also not looking forward to his daughter, Tess (Eve Hewson), moving away for school. Eva and Albert hit it off and begin dating, despite the fact that Eva is not physically attracted to Albert (due to him being overweight). Eva also starts giving massages to a client she met at the party as well, named Marianne (Keener). The two become friends and Marianne tells Eva a bunch of horror stories about her ex-husband. When Eva learns that her ex is Albert things become complicated as she doesn't know how to tell Albert or Marianne that she knows the other.

The film is funny but in a very real way; I was really impressed with how much the movie felt so true to life. It has a lot to say about attraction and relationships, as well as family and divorce. Eva and Albert's relationship is the driving point of the film and the two lead performances really make the whole thing work. Gandolfini is once again awkward and kind of crude but ultimately very lovable. It's Louis-Dreyfus that really surprised me though. On 'SEINFELD' she was so self centered and unlikeable (like all of the characters on that show, except for Kramer) so it's really refreshing to see her be so adorable. She's really sweet and so is this film; Holofcener gives the movie the perfect touch once again and proves why she's an awesome indie film director. I really liked this movie and think most others will too.

"I've been listening to this woman say the worst things about the guy I'm starting to really like." Eva (Louis-Dreyfus) is a masseuse and a single parent who is tired of being single. When she meets Albert (Gandolfini) at a party she is surprised when he asks her out. She has a few dates with him and begins to really like him and tells her new client about him and the client begins to bash her ex-husband. When Eva realizes they are talking about the same guy she is torn as to what to do. I was interested in watching this because my two favorite TV shows ever are Seinfeld and The Sopranos. I also went in a little depressed because being a huge Gandolfini fan I was saddened at his passing and knowing this was his last movie made it a little bittersweet. All that out of the way I have to say that I did like this movie but it is not a typical romantic comedy. Most movie like this are light, mostly fluff and leave you feeling happy. When this ended I felt sad and depressed. Some of it had to do with Gandolfini and some with the movie itself. While this is still a romantic comedy it is very real and that added to the sadness. I'm not saying not to watch this because I did like it but don't expect to have a super happy time watching it. Overall, good and worth watching but the saddest romantic comedy I have ever seen. I give it a B.

first of all, i would like to say that i do miss James Gandolfini. his sudden past away indeed made me feel very regretful and sad. this film is perhaps his last swan song but like always sang in a such nice and natural way, making this film a very heart warming film that has become rare and rare in recent years. this film also re-telling us what could be called or categorized as a 'comedy', a 'good' and a 'very good' comedy. what i like most is that when you watched this film, it gave you a very mature, quite realistically down-to-earth feeling. of course, the coincidental relationships between and among these modern day couples or divorcées somehow felt not quite possible, yet at the same time, it also allow you to accept it to be happened possibly. the casting job was top notched, all of them were convincing and likable. there's nothing i could be picky to criticize or cursed, because it's such a nice film that left a very nice after taste when it ended. a very very lovely romantic comedy and most of all, a REAL comedy.

Saw one of the most wonderful movies in years tonight. I've been a huge fan of Nicole Holofcener's ever since her first feature "Walking and Talking," through "Friends with Money," "Lovely and Amazing," and "Please Give." But with "Enough Said" she has outdone herself. Perfect is the only word for it. 

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a divorcée working as a massage therapist and getting ready to send her daughter off from California to Sarah Lawrence College. At a party she meets two people, a man she starts dating (played by the late James Gandolfini) and a poet who becomes her client and her friend (Holofcener regular Catherine Keener). To say more would constitute a spoiler, but nothing seems contrived or manipulative. It's the dialogue, hilarious and touching by turns, and the superb acting that sell the story. Holofcener is an immense talent as both writer and director, and Louis-Dreyfus is marvelous in the lead. But the most memorable thing about the movie is the charming, funny, indelibly poignant last appearance of Gandolfini, who was never this good in any role other than Tony Soprano. A posthumous Oscar is a necessity.

Excellent romcom with top of their game acting by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini (in his penultimate role) as a pair of mismatched divorcees attempting a relationship that is complicated by the fact that his ex (Keener) is her masseuse client leading to a comedy of errors and a lot of emotional juggling. Funny, real and spot-on dialogue highlight a great screenplay by Nicole Holofcener allowing her leads to sparkle and display some subtle nuanced charms. A winner.

Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, Enough Said is an effort aimed at adults about one adult and one not-so adult. 

Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a divorced masseuse with a daughter leaving for college in a short while. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) at a party and discovers he is also divorced and also has a daughter leaving for college in the fall.

Eva and Albert hit it off at the party in a subdued, measured way. Albert likes Eva. He likes her sense of humor and her openness. Eva thinks that she may also like Albert, although she is surprised that she might be falling for someone who is fat.

After a short while, the movie takes a sharp turn south and becomes more and more absurd. Eva meets divorced, navel-gazing, pop poet, Marianne. Eva doesn't know it, but Marianne is the former wife of Albert. Marianne needs a confidant and turns to Eva. She talks about the shortcomings of her ex-husband constantly. They are never issues of integrity or values, but petty laundry lists of annoying habits. 

Eva absorbs Marianne's petty, superficial judgments like a sponge. At a dinner party hosted by her best friend, Eva suddenly and continually humiliates Albert in front of her friends. She spews out cruel, vengeful criticism and mocks Albert. Albert is crushed. He thought Eva cared for him the way he cared for her. Eva broke Albert's heart.

Eva was needy and shallow. She attached herself to her daughters best friend to make her a surrogate daughter and didn't even bother to wait until her own child had left for college to do so. She realized that she made a huge mistake with Albert, not because she's sorry for betraying his friendship and love, but because she "misses" him. 

Seriously, how is the audience expected to connect with a character like Eva? Albert is presented as a loyal, trust-worthy man with quiet dignity and immense integrity. Eva is presented as a clinging twit without an ounce of self-awareness. Great acting jobs by Galdolfini, Louis-Dreyfus, Toni Collette (as Eva's best friend), and Catherine Keener (as Albert's ex-wife). Weak script, character development, and directing. Enough said.

Romantic comedies are predictable even for fans of the genre. Beautiful girl meets gorgeous guy. They're clearly made for each other. Invariably, they fall madly in love. But something or other gets in the way  a narrative obstacle that's serious enough to break them up but not drastic enough to keep them apart forever. Cue tears, misunderstandings, tantrums and more, until the inevitable happy ending trots along to wrap everything up neatly. It's all so painfully predictable that fans of romantic comedies now feel the need to qualify their taste in films: "I know they're terrible/predictable/silly/unrealistic/etc, but I like them anyway!" In other words, we're a long, long way away from the heyday of the romantic comedy in the 1930s and 1940s  when screwball ruled Hollywood and the films being produced were the finest in any genre.

Fortunately, every once in a while, films like writer-director Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said happen along  films so warmly romantic, funny and realistic (after a fashion) that they prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there's life, quality and potential yet in a tired genre.

Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a divorced massage therapist about to send her grown-up daughter off to college. She meets Al (James Gandolfini) at a party, and strikes up a sweet, tender relationship with him  without realising that her newest client Marianne (Catherine Keener) is Al's bitter ex-wife. Instead of coming clean when she first makes the connection, Eva remains friends with Marianne, picking up details about Al's greatest failings and foibles along the way.

A sillier, more farcical version of Enough Said could easily have been made  one that plays up the more ridiculous nature of this unusual love triangle: one side love, one side hate, one side initially blissful ignorance (on poor Al's part, at least). It would have, invariably, wound up on the ever-growing trash-heap of today's rom-coms: bland, silly, forgettable.

Instead, Holofcener has crafted something far finer and wiser: Enough Said is a sunny, charming comedy of manners, deception and relationships that cuts surprisingly deep. The film is startlingly powerful as an examination of the ebb and flow of a relationship: the way in which it can shift, deepen and curdle with the simplest of gestures. Eva and Al's courtship unfolds in the gently awkward way real relationships do, as they test each other's comfort zones and senses of humour. The connection between their characters feels genuine and not forced.

There are no outrageous, contrived twists breaking Eva and Al up: it's all on Eva, as she stumbles through her awkward friendship with Marianne towards inevitable disaster. Eva's slow, agonising betrayal of Al's trust  for that is what it is  is treated with maturity and intelligence: it's something we can imagine ourselves doing in her situation, a complication wrought by human curiosity and error rather than the typically ludicrous twists that break couples up in more traditional rom-coms.

Louis-Dreyfus, radiating charm and sunshine, is a huge reason why Holofcener's film works as well as it does. She makes Eva enormously sympathetic without ever suggesting that she is anything but a normal human being with her own pile of issues to sort through. In Louis-Dreyfus' skillful hands, watching Eva puzzle through her feelings towards Al in light of Marianne's complaints proves enlightening rather than alienating. It might be reprehensible, but it's also understandable, rich with insight into relationships, secrets and trust.

Enough Said is, tragically, Gandolfini's final film  and one of his handful of lead roles on the silver screen. It's a fitting farewell to an excellent actor, one that sees him eschew the histrionics and drama of some of his more flamboyant supporting roles. Here, he inhabits Al's burly frame with teddy-bear sweetness, lending him a quiet dignity as he finds himself increasingly, eerily reminded of his ex-wife with every day he spends with Eva.

Perhaps most impressively of all, Enough Said takes all the tropes that you've come to associate with rom-coms, and gives them a little spin for the better. The boy and girl here are a man and woman who have lived through their share of life and heartbreak. They meet, and fall in love: not in a saccharine-sweet montage of horse-drawn carriages and kisses atop the Empire State Building, but in long conversations and through meeting each other's daughters. There's even a sardonic best friend who provides comic relief, except here, she's a woman who feels frustratingly suffocated in her marriage, played with an undercurrent of sadness by Toni Collette. It all adds up to the finest, sweetest, deepest romantic comedies in years  a film that glorifies its genre while being so good that it comes rather close to transcending it.

Turns out, i got more than i bargained for, it actually turned out to be one of my favorite films of the year, not just because of Gandolfini, but because of the other cast such as the wonderful Julia Louis-Dreyfus and many others. Loved what they did with it and i am so glad that the great life of James Gandolfini will be ending on a great memorable note.

Bittersweet, of course, as it was one of James Gandolfini's last films before his sadly untimely death. Melancholy, too, as his sweet, smart, and gentle portrayal of a fundamentally decent guy was spot on, and such a lovely departure from the brutality of Tony Soprano. For those of us who had watched his career, we knew he was capable of more (see his sensitive enforcer in "Get Shorty,"), but despaired of him being typecast as a heavy. 

Those morose reflections aside, this is a funny and honest film. Some of the honesty is wince inducing, especially when showing the stupid things we do to keep from being hurt or compromised in a new relationship. Ms. Louis-Dreyfuss for the most part did a good job, but a few times the character seemed to verge on a slightly saner version of Elaine from Seinfield. 

Still, it was a good character piece, a rom-com for the romantically jaded, middle-aged person with both kids and baggage. Well worth your time.

"I've been listening to this woman say the worst things about the guy I'm starting to really like." 

Directed and written by Nicole Holofcener (Friends With Money and Please Give), Enough Said is a charming middle aged rom com that benefits from an incredible chemistry between James Gandolfini and Julia-Louis Dreyfus and a witty script. At first I had a hard time separating Julia's character from her sitcom roles, but eventually she began growing on me and I ended up enjoying her performance. The true highlight of the film however was the late James Gandolfini's performance. He was absolutely charming and delivers on a completely different range than what he showed in The Sopranos or most of his other film roles. Here he plays a very sympathetic and sweet middle aged divorced father who is having a hard time accepting the fact that his daughter is leaving for college. It was one of his best performances and he deserves all the accolades he's been receiving. Enough Said is one of those rare mature comedies that delivers authentic moments. It's a realistic and warm film that adults will enjoy. People who say that they don't make films for middle aged adults anymore should check this out. I am glad Holofcener is receiving so much love for this film because it's good to have a strong female voice in Hollywood. This is a film for grown ups about second chances and finding love after having failed in the past.

Eva (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) is a divorced middle aged mother who works as a masseuse. Her daughter is about to leave for college and so she's beginning to feel the void her absence will cause. After going to a party with her married friends, Sarah (Toni Collette) and Will (Ben Falcone), she meets Albert (James Gandolfini) a divorced father who is going through a similar experience with her daughter. The two hit off pretty well and begin dating. At the same party Eva also meets Marianne (Catherine Keener), and she becomes one of her clients. Eva quickly becomes friends with her admiring her style and good taste, but when she discovers that Albert was her ex-husband who she speaks terribly of, she begins having second thoughts about starting a relationship with him. She continues to date Albert and befriend Marianne without ever telling them about each other while she tries to make up her mind about giving love a second chance.

This romantic comedy drama is charming without ever being unauthentic or ringing false. It seems to hit all the right notes at the right time. I loved the scenes that Gandolfini and Dreyfus shared together, especially their first date. The scenes they shared together sitting on his front porch were also very touching and charming. Toni Collette's accent in this film felt a bit out of place, but I enjoyed the rest of the performances and every character was developed pretty well. The film does say something important about the power behind words and how much the opinion of someone we admire affects us in the way we perceive others and make decisions about them. Despite how much Eva liked Albert she let Marianne's perception of him influence her in the way she saw him. Enough Said is just one of those warm films that are hard to resist. Gandolfini truly shines here.

In "Enough Said" we meet Eva...a divorced, needy, aimless and apparently frustrated middle-aged masseuse. She spends her days performing a job which brings her little joy while simultaneously parenting her college-bound daughter, Ellen (Tracy Faraway). At a dinner party, where she plays the role of third wheel for another couple, she meets a new client, Marianne. Marianne, played by a sleep-walking Catherine Keener, is a famous yet isolated poet who needs a new friend. Eva is happy to oblige. Meanwhile, at the same party Eva is introduced to Alfred who will become her love interest. Like her, Alfred is lonely and has an ex-wife and a college-bound daughter in tow. Unlike her, he is slightly more fulfilled in his job as a classic television program restorer and cataloguer. Cue the hilarity.

Okay...NOT! Billed as a smart "romcom" for adults, Enough Said is at best a "rom-drama." Now, this isn't to say that there aren't moments of humor. There are. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an expressive face which serves up several chuckles in the first half of the film. However, once the oh so predictable plot twist finally occurs...and keeps twisting for the remainder of the movie!...humor is cast aside. Instead, it becomes a squirm-inducing marathon as the audience watches Eva mismanage every relationship in her life.

Meanwhile, along the way we meet other characters who are part of way too many sub-plots. Eva's best friend Sarah (well played by Toni Collette) is a therapist who at home is locked in a tug-of-war with her husband over whether or not to fire their maid; Ellen's friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson)is misunderstood by her own mother, so Eva steps in to fill the gap; and Alfred's daughter Tess (Eve Hewson)is alternately snotty and sympathetic. Confused? I was too. By the time Enough Said ended, never have I been more surprised when I looked at my watch. With everything going on this movie, I'd though it'd been much longer than its 1 hour 33 minute run time.

Now, "Enough Said" isn't without some commendation. For his part, James Gandolfini...in what was sadly his last role...did an admirable job with his character. Alfred is sweet, patient and clumsily kind. We can't help but root for him. The same can be said for Sarah's husband, Will, played by Ben Falcone. But unfortunately any bright spots that illumine this film are overshadowed by a darker than expected plot, poor editing and a plodding music score which only adds to it's general heaviness.

In a moment of uncomfortable small talk during the film's opening dinner party scene, Eva blurts out "only ugly people here." This sentence foreshadows what comes after it, 1 1/2 hours of ugly behavior and blurred relationship boundaries. Combine that with the aforementioned editing problems and a bleak musical score, and what we have is simply a mess. Enough Said.

Enough Said is the latest occasional cinema offering from writer and director Nicole Holofcener whose mainly television credits include Six Feet Under and the witty Parks and Recreation.

It is a middle-aged rom-com centering on a budding relationship between two fifty-something divorcees Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Albert (James Gandolfini). Eva, an unfulfilled masseuse finds a common bond with the overweight and slightly slob-prone Albert, a television librarian. Both are struggling with the realisation that their respective daughters are soon to leave home and State as they go off to further education. Eva shares her experiences and details of her incipient romance with a coterie of friends, the therapist Sarah (Toni Collette) and successful poet Marianne (Catherine Keeler).

The film's comedy though pretty firmly rooted in safe, white bread territory is nonetheless both funny and nicely played. There are some very enjoyable set pieces and the dialogue between all the protagonists flows nicely  the characters are well drawn. There is distinct chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini, in his penultimate screen performance. Eva's slightly down-trodden persona matches nicely with Albert whose perceptive nous is perhaps under-rated by those who judge him on his physical appearance.

The twist, when it comes, relies on a previously latent and unknown familial relationship  a fairly common device for a rom-com. But, unlike the similar twist in Crazy, Stupid Love this one is both believable and within the flow of the film's story.

The film's main strength lies in the high quality of acting from the two romantic leads who are ably and well supported by Catherine Keeler and particularly Toni Collette. Gandolfini is given the strongest role by Holofcener  a wise decision, giving the film better balance with he being the only non-peripheral man in the piece.

The main criticism to be made is of the sub-standard editing which jars several times and is distinctly off-putting. The musical score is nothing to write home about either. But both these minuses need to be put into the context of an amiable and pleasant film which, whilst not delivering anything new, is well paced and engaging  it has no pretensions to be avant garde. It knows its niche and sticks to it.

Last year, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel defied the mainstream critics and became a success as it found an audience who enjoyed the sight of people far from the first flush of youth who had not given up on love or the idea of sex. I believe Enough Said might enjoy support from a similar audience. It deserves it.

My wife and I went out last night to see a movie that would help us relax after our dinner and Enough Said was perfect for our digestion. If you have an appetite for a light romantic comedy than Enough Said will not disappoint. The two main stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini play a pair of divorced and currently single parents who each respectively have a daughter who is going off to college in a few weeks. Through a chance meeting at an evening party Eva (played by Julia Louis- Dreyfus) and Albert (played by James Gandolfini) bump in to one another and exchange what appear to be a few meaningless words about the dating pool being a bit sparse at the party they are attending. Of interest to some viewers, this was the second last movie appearance by James Gandolfini before he passed away in June 2013 well before he should have. He is missed dearly.

A few days later Eva's good friend Sarah (played by Toni Collette) who was also at the evening party suggests to Eva that Albert was interested in seeing Eva sometime. With a little bit of prodding by Sarah, Eva eventually agrees to a first date with Albert, and they enjoy each others company after exchanging a bit of information about their respective daughters, their divorces, and their now ex spouses. 

We as the audience are keenly interested in how Eva and Albert's relationship will blossom or blow up. Albert has a unique job as a Manager of a television archive library which he truly loves, and Eva works as a masseuse but she is not crazy about having to carry her heavy massage table up and down clients stair cases and listen to some of her customers' blather on to no end. One of Eva's recent new clients is a poet named Marianne (played superbly by Catherine Keener) who she coincidentally met at the same evening party that she first met Albert. Marianne appears to have a connection to Albert that we the audience do not take long to figure out based on Marianne's griping about her ex husband and the father of her daughter. 

Eva is very fond of Albert but she admits to her good friend Sarah that she is reluctant to make the same mistakes that she made with her previous relationship and her first husband. Even the difference in the way Albert is bringing up his teenage daughter leaves Eva questioning his parental skills compared to her own. 

These are two very different people Eva and Albert. They have different physiques. Eva is petite, and Albert is a big bowl of jelly who is very comfortable in his own skin and his pajamas. They have different home lives, and different career paths. Albert is definitely the more laid back person in this relationship and he is willing to hang out (sometimes literally without knowing) with Eva without hiding anything in his past life. Eva on the other hand is more judgemental and willing to give free advice to Albert and others but not so willing to be on the receiving end of criticism.

Enough Said has many humorous segments and interactions amongst the main characters. The characters are all flawed (as we all are except you the reader of this review of course) and the story line if there is a message is to try and let bygones be bygones and move on with your life and learn from your mistakes. No one is perfect, so if you find a mate that your heart is saying warm and fuzzy things to you, tell your judgement to give it a rest because there is enough said!

The late and great James Gandolfini will always be Tony Soprano. No doubt about that. Although he never garnered the kind of roles and acclaim that he undoubtedly deserved on the big screen, he will forever be remembered in the halls of TV history for his iconic and powerful portrayal of the troubled mobster. Following Gandolfini's tragic and untimely death in Rome earlier this year, the most that fans could look forward to were the final films he had been working on. One such film is Enough Said, the story of a divorcée's relationship with the ex-husband of one of her massage clients and the obvious, resultant complications arising from this. The good news is that the great actor's final screen performance is, deservedly, an appropriate farewell. Eva (Julia Louis- Dreyfus) is a single divorcée of ten years about to watch her daughter go off to college. With no romantic social life to speak of Eva whiles away her time as a masseuse, forced to persevere with the bad breaths and incessant chattering of her clients. At a party, however, Eva meets Albert (Gandolfini) and though mutually agreeing that they aren't attractive to anyone there, something seems to click between the two. Things only get better as they begin dating with Eva succumbing to Albert's charms even though, as she repeatedly remarks, she was initially put off by his overweight appearance. There is only one problem. And quite a big one at that. At the same party where she met Albert, Eva bonded with Marianne (Catherine Keener), a divorcée like herself, who decides to enlist the assistance of Eva's massage skills. If you didn't see it coming, or if you haven't seen the numerous trailers which give it away, it transpires that Marianne is actually Albert's ex-wife! As Marianne continually disparages Albert during their massage sessions, Eva increasingly finds herself torn between her own affection for the new man in her life and the character she is building in her mind through her client's appraisals. Enough Said is a nice, pleasant indie rom-com which won't get you thinking much after the ending. It is helped by the great performances and on-screen chemistry of its leads as well as from a sharp and witty script. Director, Nicole Holofcener, also deserves credit for giving Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus plenty of time during scenes to assert themselves as their characters, making it hard not to crack a smile during many of their exchanges. Dreyfuss is great as the funny and intelligent Eva who jeopardises her relationship through an all too willing ear and her own insecurities. The film feels like it is missing something however whenever Gandolfini is off-screen. It is hard not to associate the large, bear-like frame with the patriarch of the Soprano family but Gandolfini proves why he was chosen not only to play a mafia don but also a therapy-driven man struggling with his overpowering emotions. Combining wit and charm, Gandolfini brings an added sensitivity to the good-at-heart but slovenly and overweight Albert who expresses only confusion and sadness when he discovers the truth behind Eva's misgivings. It is a subtle performance truly worthy of one of the actor's final films. Additional, good support is provided by indie regulars, Toni Collete as Eva's friend and Catherine Keener. While some scenes may feel repetitive like the numerous comedic moments squeezed from the issue of Albert's weight, and the inevitable complications arising from it, this is still an enjoyable, light hearted film which is a satisfactory send off to the great life and career of James Gandolfini.

I was really looking forward to this film, mainly because I really liked director Holofcener's previous efforts, Walking & Talking & Please Give. However this to me came off as a trite, predictable sitcom episode guest-starring Dreyfus & Gandalfino doing their usual shticks. Hahaha.

Particularly irritating are Dreyfus's constant mugging & over-acting to every situation in every scene in order,I guess, to please to her fams. Gandolfino mostly shrugs his way through his part, looking bored & maybe even a little embarrassed & never upstaging his co- star but never being very funny, either. 

This is like a contemporary vesion of those awful Bob Hope comedies they cranked out in the 60s & 70s when the star was far too old for his parts but his routines were still bankable with an ever-gullible public.

I really like Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) in Seinfeld and I thought Enough Said would be a heartfelt romantic comedy. While the storyline is interesting, the execution is quite weak with great room for improvement. 

I did not expect to see another Elaine but Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is just another Elaine except she is older  a divorced masseur who has a college-bound daughter. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) at a party who is also a divorced parent with a college-bound daughter. They go out a few times afterwards and it seems there is some attraction going on.

At the same party, Eva befriends Marianne (Catherine Keener), a poet and a potential massage client. After a few transactions, they become very good friends and Marianne begins to pour herself while Eva shares her excitement with her new date. Very soon Marianne starts to badmouth her ex-husband.

The interesting part begins here when Eva tries to get some insights of her new dates and finds out his identity. I can sympathize with Eva that she wants to learn more about Albert from other people, but as a modern woman and a fellow divorcée, she should be smart and rational enough to filter what she hears from his ex, which is susceptible to be biased. I can't help but feel sorry for her when her judgment and hence behavior become clouded by his ex's comments and hence her behavior could be hurtful to Albert.

That's about it for all the interesting and positive part of the movie. The supporting cast are more enjoyable to watch than the main actors. Marianne play excellently as a bitchy, snobbish, and rich single mom. Toni Collette plays the role of Sarah, a therapist and a very supportive friend who is obsessed with firing her domestic helper. What a waste to put her in such a minor role.

In addition to being another Elaine, Louis-Dreyfus's acting is too exaggerating and superficial. Albert seems to be quite a boring character although he is trying to appear to be a relaxed and carefree slob who has good sense of humor. But I really cannot find Albert attractive in spite of his figure. His sense of humor could make up for it but his jokes are not funny either. I also do not see any sparkle between the couple although they say they like each other. So it seems a double disaster (bad acting and script).

On the script, there are also too many sidelines  Eva's relationship with her daughter, daughter's friend always hanging around, and Sarah's relationship with her maid and husband etc  all of these have very little to do with the main plot and serve no purpose (bad plot and script). Sometimes I wonder what Woody Allen would do for the same story. The writing is way weaker than Sex in the City though the poster compares these two works together.

On the whole, I find the story development too bland, the plot too unfocused or too ambitious and the humor too lame despite the interesting storyline with good intention.

There is one very good reason to see 'Enough Said' and that is of course the late James Gandolfini's performance. It was nice seeing him in a role where he played a character that was the opposite of Tony Soprano, the part he'll always be known for. Here he's a self-effacing, low key, 'good guy', probably close in temperament to the way friends and family have described him in real life.

The film's inciting incident occurs when Eva, a divorced masseuse with a teenage daughter, is introduced to Gandolfini's character, Albert, at a party in an affluent section of Los Angeles. Eva also meets Marianne, a successful poet, at the party and she takes her on as one of her massage clients.

The film proceeds slowly as Albert courts Eva. Despite his girth, Albert manages to charm Eva who confesses that she usually isn't attracted to large men but is gradually won over by his sense of humor.

The break into Act II, occurs when Eva discovers that her new massage client (and newly found friend) is Albert's ex-wife. The main weakness of the plot hinges on Eva's decision not to tell Marianne that she's going out with Albert. The explanation given is that Eva somehow also likes Marianne and doesn't want to upset her. This, of course, is at the expense of her relationship with Albert.

It's hard to believe that Eva, due to her poor choice, didn't anticipate that she would end up in such an awkward position like trying to hide in the bushes, to avoid making contact with Marianne's daughter, who she had met earlier as well as that even more awkward moment when Albert finds her at Marianne's house.

The bulk of 'Enough Said' hinges on Eva's bad decision and one keeps wondering why she simply couldn't have been honest with Marianne from the get go. But of course if that's the case, there would have been no movie.

As a character, Marianne is unlikeable and one-note, with her constant put-downs of her ex-husband. But she also serves the purpose of putting doubts in Eva's mind as to whether Albert is truly a good catch. Most of the complaints do seem trivial, including Albert's penchant for separating the onions in the guacamole and his inability to clean up after himself. But his rigid insistence that he does whisper (when he clearly doesn't), is a point, which, if I were Eva, would not overlook.

Nonetheless, as things play out, Eva does realize the error of her ways, leading to the heart felt reconciliation at the film's climax.

'Enough Said' also has a number of sub-plots best described as only slightly amusing. One involves Eva's daughter's friend, who enjoys spending quality time with Eva, much to the chagrin of her own mother.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is most enjoyable when she plays off of Gandolfini's self-deprecating humor. The banter between the two is what makes 'Enough Said' so engaging. Nonetheless, Eva's failure to come clean at the onset, resulting in the plot's complications, is not something I believe most people would have chosen to do in real life.

For those of you looking for a grown-up/realistic movie with beautiful acting, you will not be disappointed with this gem. I am sad now that I will never got to see other work by the late James Gandolfini. He seemed to have finally reached a new height with his role in this movie. I admired how he depicted his vulnerability and limitations so openly and honestly without trying to be anyone else or emulate anyone else. Truly unique and uncompromising in his own right. I never warmed up to his Tony Soprano character but he was an absolute gem in this one. Julia Dreyfus just moved to the top of my awesome actors list. She shows her frailties and limitations and potential for human expansion in such a beautiful way. I hope she gets an award for this. The story is around her seemingly mundane life wanting more and looking for love but in a real way. She is willing to explore all her shadow parts of herself without sparing others in the process. Loved the simple yet realistic love story that takes a few cynical, and downturns but full of human frailties that are depicted in such a realistic way.
