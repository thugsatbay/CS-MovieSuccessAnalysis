### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I have never wrote a review for a movie before now, and I have written this because I am so annoyed with people's ignorance towards a good animated movie. 

I watched 'the good dinosaur' yesterday at the cinema, not knowing what to expect as I had not looked at any reviews and I had only watched a 30 second trailer...

I entered the cinema with my mum and we were the only adults without children with us! So, before it started I was slightly sceptical, thinking that it was going to be very kiddish! Then the film started.. through most of the film, my mum and I were in tears! It is the most heartwarming, emotional, animated film I have watched and it really touched my heart, some of the scenes in the film were so brilliantly thought out to show real messages! There was one scene where I was in floods of tears, the scene dealt with a serious theme, but did it so brilliantly! (you'll know what I mean if you watch it!) I even came out of the cinema with my eyes still watering!

All I am saying is do not listen to the bad reviews. Most of them will be expecting something complex but, this film is really not about that! This film is inspiring! Especially for children! It is a simple film, but the subtle messages, such as overcoming your fears, the importance of family, and making your mark were heartwarming, and make you think, a lot! 

And for those reviews that said the film scared their child? Well, I was in a cinema full of children ageing from 2-10, and throughout the film they were asking questions, laughing, and full of excitement! This film was very funny, but emotional at the right times, with a great plot that really makes you think! I loved this film a lot more than other Pixar films such as wall-E, Up or Toy Story. Yes, I know that these films have imaginative, classic plots, but this film teaches you a lot more than they do, and also makes you feel for the characters! So go ahead and watch! But don't listen to the bad reviews! Make up your own mind!

Pixar have always been a shining light of absolute quality in story telling, characters and animation.

Where DreamWorks and Disney often labor the point of a story, or fumble around in sentimentality, mediocrity - Pixar have always been absolutely genius at bringing something original and truly memorable to the screen. 

A company that produces such wonderful movies as Cars, The Incredibles, Nemo, Toy Story and Wall-E - should not, could not - produce this completely worthless piece of nonsense.

My three year old spends his days singing the songs from Cars, recreating the action with his toys, and playing with his Woody and Buzz - he's also a HUGE dinosaur fan - so while something like "Inside Out" is a bit beyond him, how could a dinosaur movie where the dinosaur is good rather than 'scarewee' as he says go wrong!!!!

Seemingly on every single level.

While the scenery is gorgeously rendered with absolute realism the characters themselves are completely devoid of any effort at all. There is nothing about Arlo the dinosaur or the small human boy that is even slightly interesting or novel. They are drawn and animated as though someone said to an animator - you have 10 minutes to render a dinosaur and a small boy. It is saying something when the toy dinosaur in Toy Story is rendered with more love and affection, and more genuine character than any dinosaur in an entire movie which has the word 'Dinosaur' in the title.

Apart from a small 2 minute section of the movie, where they meet a very interesting hippie dinosaur who was brilliant but who they inexplicably just bump into, exchange about 20 words with and then leave - there is no redeeming or interesting character anywhere in the movie.

Arlos father seems to be more interested in Arlo murdering a child, his siblings seem to be evil bullies - Arlo himself is a wimp and the human child is more wolf like than human. Every other character they meet seems to be either racist (some deep South accented dinosaurs portrayed as dumb hicks) or some weird T-Rexes who gallop along rounding up bison with accents straight out of John Wayne movies.

The film moves from one scary scene to the next, so from horrible storm and a badly injured limping Arlo, to Arlos father being drowned in the river, to Arlo in another storm falling down a hill and passing out in the water, to him falling off a cliff, to him running out of food, to being attacked and hunted and so on and so on.

It is completely relentless in its desire to just move to another cliff hanger. The friendship between Arlo and the human boy seems like fluff - with just silly setups like character A gets stuck, wakes to find character B has helped them. Character A gets hungry, finds character B leaving or shoving food there way. Character A and B fall asleep and wake up to find they're leaning against each other. There are no genuine touching moments, "Ice Age" while garbage compared to most of Pixars output, still managed a more convincing buddy story of odd companions traveling together than did this movie.

At the end of the movie Arlo finds his way home and inexplicably pushes the human boy onto a random human family that he moments before rejected for some reason. He makes his way home and is allowed to leave his foot print on a wall which he wasn't allowed to do earlier because his family viewed him as a giant clumsy wimp who wouldn't kill a human.

There was so much opportunity for a movie which had the premise that "What if, the dinosaurs weren't wiped out". But apart from the farm that Arlo and his family come from, there is no indication of any dinosaur civilization other than random ones that try to either attack him or eat him. I was expecting something more Flintstones - but it seams that the only premise for the meteor missing the earth was to allow a dinosaur and a human to co-exist in the story.

I was beyond disappointed with this movie. I actually checked online in the middle to make sure this was actually a Pixar film. The writing was so abhorrent that I almost got up and left in the middle. One line that I just found unbelievable was when the scar-faced dinosaur said he drowned the crocodile in a pool of his own blood! There was absolutely no comic relief and I only felt relieved when it ended. It is on par with the unedited version of Toy Story. Will think twice about going to the theater to watch another Pixar film. Don't waste your money. We went to see Inside Out at the theater and even though it had adult themes and was stressful at times, it had a deep redeeming meaning. I know that they were trying to show the bond of family and friendship but it was so lacking. If the whole script was rewritten to be funnier and less scary, then it would be worth it.

Probably the worst animated film I ve seen the last decade. What annoyed me most was the fact that Pixar decided to use a very common plot such as "farm boy lost in the wild try to find its way to home with the help of a wild animal" but in order to mix it a bit and attract more audience, the farm boy ended up to be a dinosaur and its wild pet a human...For real? Is this a dinosaur movie? Seeing dinosaurs behaving like humans and humans as wild animals isn't what I call a plot!It is just disturbing! Moreover, the fact that Pixar decided that the evolved dinosaurs would create human-like societies instead of following a different path shows lack of imagination! Everyone loves dinosaurs because they represent something exotic in our minds, humanizing dinosaurs at this level is just disgusting!

Let me begin by saying that I've never seen a Disney film I didn't like, but this was the first movie I've ever walked out on.

Inside Out went viral and word spread it was a charming movie. The opposite is the case for The Good Dinosaur; word is spreading that it is an awful movie. You can't rely on stunning graphics to make a successful movie. The storyline was boring and it recycled the same plots as Land Before Time (not Disney), Finding Nemo, and The Lion King making it extremely predictable. However, unlike those three successful movies, there was very little humour, charm, or heartfelt moments present in this film. It relied heavily on action and cliffhangers. Although the moral of the story is good, "sometimes you've gotta get through your fears to see the beauty on the other side", it was nothing profound. Think of the message as though it was a gourmet dinner served on the lid of a trash can. 

Although the film is promoted as a children's' film (Its rated PG but it's advertised on the preschool Disney Jr channel), it is not a children's' movie! Forget the intense moments of the Poppa dying near the beginning Mufasa style, or the violent dinosaur fights.. The same happened in The Lion King and I expected it in this film as well. Don't be naive to think that animal violence wouldn't make an appearance in a dinosaur film. However, many of the dinosaurs in the movie are cruel and down right creepy! A gang of pterodactyls manipulate Arlo into helping their search and rescue team (which turns out to be a cult, 'the storm provides') and after Arlo saves a baby animal, the leader eats the baby alive. Really Disney? Not necessary. 

There is also many inappropriate drug references in this film. The obvious being when Arlo and Spot ingested some rotten berries and hallucinate. If that was the only alcohol/drug reference for the sake of humour, I could look past it (Think Dumbo's pink elephant parade, Tangled's drunk Cupid, etc). However, there are at least two more drug references that were more sneaky and clever to impress the adults in the audience (the paranoid drug induced spiritualist triceratop, the gang of meth addicted hillbilly velociraptors). Just inappropriate in my opinion and they made for a cast of unlikable, creepy dinosaurs. I guess Arlo was the Good Dinosaur because he said no to drugs...

I hate it when reviewers say this movie is inappropriate for children because of the animalistic violence. Again, what did you expect? It isn't scary, it's more disturbing and unlikable. As a major Disney and Pixar fan, I am sad to say this movie is a major flop and does not live up to the standards many parents expect from these studios.

I'm in my twenties and to be honest, I still enjoy watching Pixar films with my family. There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn.

When I initially read the reviews about "The Good Dinosaur", they were all so bad. It didn't stop me from watching though and I do not regret that decision. This has got to be one of the most heartwarming Pixar films I've ever seen and it tugged at my heartstrings. I was crying throughout the movie especially towards the end. 

The thing about being an adult, we tend to overthink something so simple. The plot isn't something grand. It's not funny. It's cute. If you're looking for a film like the classic Pixar favorite "Toy Story", forget about watching this. It's a really simple storyline that focuses mainly on teaching the importance of family, dealing with fears and overcoming them as well as finding oneself or making your mark in this world. View "The Good Dinosaur" with an open mind and just be ready to enjoy the movie without reading too much between the lines. The good thing about Pixar films is that they remind you how wonderful it is to still be a kid at heart. This movie is no exception. In fact, I think this joins the ranks of "Finding Nemo","UP", and "Inside Out". Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I can't help but wonder why majority just plain dislike this movie. 

If you're on the fence after reading one too many 1-star reviews, I say go ahead and still watch it. Judge for yourself. Be pure hearted like a kid and try to embrace the beautiful lessons of the film. Allow it to engulf you and touch you. If you have a kid/kids, this would be one of those perfect films to have a hearty conversation with afterwards. It's very inspiring, really. 

Give "The Good Dinosaur" a try. Oh and one more thing, don't be afraid to cry while watching this. I've seen this twice and still end up a mess every time.

It's pretty amazing that so many people seem to want to trash this movie. I watched this with my 2 daughters and my 10 year old said it was the best movie she's ever seen. She identified with Arlo's anxiety and insecurity as she also feels this way sometimes. His journey in dealing with these issues by facing his fears and, even if sheepishly at first, challenging them one by one helped her to understand herself. It allowed her to see that others struggle and can overcome these struggles in a way she hadn't seen before... up close and personal. As a child and adolescent therapist in practice for over 16 years, I can definitively tell you that any movie that prompts a child to look into themselves... to challenge their fears... and ends with them hugging you tightly, is a true marvel to behold. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. Having an emotional connection to a movie or any work of art for that matter, will always win out over special effects and beautiful backdrops. It's the reason Star Wars: A New Hope was brilliant and The Phantom Menace sucked. Anyone have any kind of emotional connection to The Phantom Menace these days?

I went to watch it expecting to find it childish, or perhaps a little predictable, but it was far worse than I could imagine. Not suitable for kids, and absolutely terrible for adults. It practically is a very, VERY bad imitation of The Lion King, along with a bit from Brother Bear, Ice Age, A Bug's Life etc., but completely lacking the heart and meaning of any of these movies. The movie doesn't even explore the implications of dinosaurs existing along with humans, to the point where it made me wonder why they didn't just pick some random animals to tell their story and let go of the whole alternate reality of dinosaurs and humans co-existing altogether.

There isn't really much of a plot to begin with. It's a road trip kind of movie (like most recent Disney and Pixar movies), during which Arlo, a young dinosaur, meets a human child with whom they become unlikely friends (surprise surprise), and many random characters along the way, who do very little to move the story forward. There is too much unnecessary violence, as well as a very weird drug scene, neither of which seem to serve the (limited) plot in any way. In addition to all that, the film isn't that visually beautiful either: the backgrounds are extremely detailed, whereas the dinosaurs look very cartoony and out of place.

Almost every scene of it felt familiar, from the human boy stealing the dinosaurs' food and them going after it, resulting to Arlo's father's death (Brother Bear), to Arlo and his father having 'meaningful' conversations about bravery under the, well, fireflies (The Lion King), to the supposedly bittersweet moment in which Arlo lets the little boy stay with the other humans (The Jungle Book/Ice Age). The Lion King kind of moments in particular where countless; Arlo even roars at some point, to little effect, until he manages to do it properly towards the end of the movie, for heaven's sake! Also, for some reason I do not seem to comprehend, the human boy was behaving, not like a human or an ape, but more like a dog, much like Maximus in Tangled and Sven in Frozen.

All in all, don't watch this movie. Stay home and re-watch the Lion King; it has so much more to offer, even if you're watching it for the millionth time.

As a parent, I've come to expect a lot from Disney/Pixar - always a safe bet for my little ones. Until now. This movie was pretty slow, and when various critters they show first as cute are suddenly eaten before my children's eyes, that was the end of the movie for us. This came after the scene where one character rips the head off another creature. My children were alternately bored and scared - definitely not what you expect in a Disney children's film. Not a film for little kids (preschool or younger) with some scenes that are guaranteed to give my young ones some nightmares and yet too boring with almost no comedy for children beyond grade school or adults. We left when my five year old turned to me and said "Mom, can we leave? This isn't fun."

Let's be honest: We've all seen bad movies before. But, did you expect one from Pixar? I definitely didn't. I entered the theatre with my dear friend, eager to see a cute and hilarious movie about a dinosaur and his human companion. I was wrong. The short featuring the little, Indian boy was actually cute. I loved it! It was an adorable way to portray Hinduism. I was happy to see it, however I'm worried some kids didn't understand it. Like Inside Out, it was enjoyable for adults but not for children. Our story begins with a pair of dinosaurs on a farm. The movie seemed okay so far; good graphics and a good start. (Speaking of the graphics, they were probably the best graphics I have ever seen. I hope they stick to the hyper realistic style.) Anyway, three baby dinosaurs were born. One of the babies was the protagonist named Arlo and he was the smallest and wimpy of the three. Once again, it was a good movie so far. I thought my friend and I were in for a treat. But, everything changed when the dad forced Arlo to almost murder a baby human. What?! Is this a PG film anymore? The father drowns in a very graphic way and Arlo runs away from his starving family. "This reminds me too much of the Lion King," My friend and I both agreed. This movie recycled plots over 2 movies! Then, some more kid-inappropriate scenes occur: Arlo is manipulated into saving a baby creature, to which another dinosaur eats it psychotically, Arlo's companion is nearly eaten alive, and Arlo and Spot (his companion) eat hallucinogenic-like berries to which they have a euphoric reaction (anyone get reminded of Dumbo?). How were these scenes even accepted into the movie?! Besides the inappropriate scenes, the movie was very bland and there were hardly any comedic scenes at all and even less, comedic scenes that were actually funny. In fact, the movie was so unfunny that I found the audience funnier and more entertaining! Also, Arlo rejected Spot's desire to return to his family... what?! That's ridiculous! Anyway though it did make my friend and the audience cry a little please do not see this movie. It's the worst Pixar movie I have ever seen. You WILL be disappointed and you WILL leave the theatre thinking that you wasted your own money. Save your money for an actual good movie, like the Lion King.

This movie is completely inappropriate for young children. My three and five year old were very disturbed by the dark and violent plot. Half- way through the movie another child yelled out, "I don't like this movie." And many others loudly agreed. Between this and the scary short before, my three year old has began to have nightmares. It was just too intense. I wish I would have read reviews before basing my opinion on it through the trailer, which lends no reason to believe the movie would be inappropriate. 

*****Spoiler***** Like in many Disney movies, the parent dies. Not only do we have to sit through an intense scene watching his death, but we get to see it replayed in an even more upsetting manner. There also many violent scenes that made my children and I gasp- like when a creature pretends to save a cute little animal only to scarf it down psychotically. 

There are some sweet touching moments in this movie but overall the plot is not entertaining. Because of this, intense and violent scenes are thrown in to keep you on your toes. But for this mama, it just kept me stressed wondering how much of this would bother my children. And unfortunately, it left them very upset. If you have sensitive young children, just don't do it!

We took our 4.5 yr old to see this movie and we all loved it. The story line takes you through all your emotions from tears to laughing. Adorable. Even my husband kept saying "wow that was a great movie!". The family dynamics portrayed in the film were great. The struggle that a child, that maybe isn't as successful as their siblings, goes through is perfect. The friendship with a creature different from oneself is such a valuable message. The struggles to fit within a family and outside of a family are real. This movie highlights all of it in a sweet and sometimes harsh manner, which is just like life. Overall worthy of a 10.

No point talking about the quality of visuals. This is Pixar, so you know exactly what to expect.

Plot wise, the story is called "The Good Dinosaur". Revolves around a create who tries to earn his mark - the rite of passage, by doing something good.

And how does he accomplish that? First, by causing the death of his father and blaming it on a human creature he was supposed to protect the food from. Then while the dinosaur goes on his little adventure, the family is left to starve, taking care of their crop field without a breadwinner. Though his journey the dinosaur naively exposes a small creature to vultures, who violently devour him in front of his eyes. He nearly loses his human companion to the same group of predators. Redemption does come, if one is to ignore that the dinosaur selfishly denied the creature the chance to re-unite with his own kind earlier, which would've prevented the whole ordeal.

He also encounters a group of T-Rex ranchers who tend a flock of buffalo's. The dinosaur helps them recover their lost herd, after being explicitly threatened by the head T-Rex. I can assure you, those carnivores don't raise buffalo's as pets, but unlike the vultures they somehow get to be the good characters in this movie.

When the journey ends, the dinosaur earns his mark, which might work from the audience's perspective, but if you judge him by the merits of his family all he's really done is abandon them with no prior warning. The good dinosaur left and came back later without a father just in time for the harvest. A true hero! I give the movie 2 stars. 1 for outstanding graphics and 1 for manipulative tear-jerk moments that worked as intended. The movie may be inappropriate for smaller kids due to occasional violence.

As for the lessons it teaches kids, the best one, I guess, is not to trust vultures... when they try squeezing $15 out of you for a movie ticket.

The fact that this movie still holds a score of a 6.8 with hundreds of 1/10 scores shows you just how good it is. I'm not here to preach that it's an awesome movie, but give it the score it deserves. (It's not PIXAR's best, but still fits the bill of a good movie.)

Honestly the highly negative scores are just because people were not BLOWN away. A PIXAR movie sets the bar so high, so the fact that this one isn't an A+, people are bashing just to bash.

I watched this with my cousins, all at the time were under 10 ( 7 & 9 ) and nothing was too scary. Could it be over the top for 4 or 5 year old, of course, but it's not that bad. The Lion King is regarded as one of the BEST Disney films ever and there are similar scenes with death, scary bad-guys, hard times, etc. 

Give it a watch.

The Good Dinosaur is beautiful movie with kind characters, a wonderful story about friendship and family and the artwork is just amazing. Of course there are evil characters too- it's about dinosaurs, so that seems obvious. Compared to other computer animation movies there are only a few action scenes, instead there are beautiful generated landscapes. And about tragedy: it's as "disturbing" as "Lion King" and "Bambi". We really enjoyed The Good Dinosaur every minute! Maybe not the best Pixar Movie out there but with the Heart at the right Place. Nice twist to the Boy and his Dogs Movies.

If I may caveat this review first. You know your children better than I do, and will know if they are able to handle the content of this movie.

First, I don't feel this movie was well marketed. In fact, I found it misleading. I think they presented it as a typical child friendly animated movie with a goofy looking green dinosaur and his silly companion (human/dog) on an adventure. Certainly, Pixar films often include content that is oriented to older audience members, but have maintained a balance that appeals to all ages.

The Good Dinosaur, however, fails at this. It is a surprisingly violent movie, and not a cartoonish violence. There is a flash flood that kills a character within the first 30 minutes, and a flashback later in the movie, with a second flood in the finale. It isn't unusual for the character of any animated film to undergo a trauma (e.g. the Lion King), but whereas those maintain an animated feel, the flash flood was very realistic. The whole movie is a strange contrast between the cartoonish green dino and a very realistic natural environment. The visuals are impressive to be honest. My son (6) found the flash flood and the thunderstorms to be terrifying, combined with the loud sound effects and darkened theater. There were also the "bad dinosaurs" that demolished a little furry mammal, and fought over the carcass. And a strange triceratops that tried to name the human/dog character by calling it "murderer" and other violent names. It was really bizarre.

So as a parent, I give it 2 stars, because it was not age appropriate for younger kids, and I don't think there has been sufficient warning about the content of this film. I guess I can't let Pixar just slide by given its past work, and should try and find out more about their films before going. As I say at the start, your kid may not be bothered by the elements in the movie, and certainly older ones will be better able. If your kid has a fear of natural disasters, def. skip it.

As an audience member, I might give it 5 stars. Beyond the really impressive natural landscapes they have created, the story is quite boring. It is a traditional, boy on adventure finding himself style movie. It has been done so many times before, and better.

After being blown away by Pixar's previous film 'Inside Out' (which is one of their best too), while not really deserving of so many 1- star reviews 'The Good Dinosaur' disappointed on many levels. 

Not just lesser Pixar but a contender for their worst too, even more so than the often panned 'Cars 2' (which to me while not great was not that bad). It is a long way from an awful film, certainly much better than several reviews have lead you to believe (seeing as 1- star indicates no redeeming qualities, which is not the case here), but considering Pixar's usual incredibly high standard I was expecting so much more. 

There are a number of good things here in 'The Good Dinosaur'. Much of the animation is spectacular, including some of Pixar's most gorgeously vivid colours and some of their most stunning and rich- in-detail backgrounds. The music score is both whimsical and energetic, and the film also benefits from some clever casting and very strong voice acting, Sam Elliot in particular stands out. Many have complained of Arlo's voice work, it wasn't a problem personally.

On top of those, 'The Good Dinosaur' does have some genuinely funny moments (mostly visual), parts that are genuinely touching, some thumping, thrilling action, a beautifully realised central friendship, an endearing lead character in Arlo and an inspirational main message (as a matter of fact, all the lessons and messages the film teaches are great). So a lot to admire. 

However, 'The Good Dinosaur' does fall short. While there is much to admire in the animation overall, it also contains the least appealing character designs in any of Pixar's film, the photo- realistic look looks cartoony rather than realistic and jars against the vivid backgrounds . While keeping things simple can work in a film's favour, 'The Good Dinosaur' is rather too simple and straight-forward that the storytelling while not completely dull lacks momentum and veers on being too paper-thin and simplistic as well as being too predictable and familiar. Target audience is also an issue. 

Adults may find themselves checking their watches, not that it's completely dull but unlike much of Pixar's other films it is not consistently captivating. And with children, while this viewer usually tries to not complain about anything being too dark or unnecessary and has been known to defend films criticised for that 'The Good Dinosaur' is an example of a film where that criticism is valid and understandable, because there is some dark and disturbing content (like a decapitation and a drug reference) that added absolutely nothing and quite frankly had no place in a family film. The violence is similarly gratuitous. The script is inconsistent in the laughs and emotional investment factors and is not as clever, witty, insightful or as intelligently structured as the writing for Pixar's best, coming across as even more paper-thin and simplistic than the storytelling and the dialogue itself is often cheesy and clichéd. 

In conclusion, not as bad as most have made out but very much a lesser Pixar. Has enough good merits to make it watchable, but it's the only Pixar film to date to disappoint me. Very hard to decide between a 5 or 6, as it was actually not easy to rate, so it's got a 5.5/10 (somewhere in between). Bethany Cox

This film is cutely animated but completely warped in its nuances about human existence. Even from an evolutionary point of view it is ludicrous, assigning dog-like characteristics to early humans. Basically, the movie is dehumanizing nonsense not fit for a young audience, nor any other audience for that matter.

Human characteristics are instead transferred to the animals, in particular dinosaurs. The human child (main supporting character) makes dog-like sounds and exhibits dog behavior, whereas the dinosaurs and most other animals in the movie take on human characteristics (anthropomorphism). Granted, the movie is fictional but it misses an opportunity to engage the audience convincingly because of this ridiculous notion. Give it a miss!

Warning: Contains spoilers.

I'd like to start off by saying I had high expectations for this movie. It seemed like a unique premise from the trailers and it was coming from Pixar which has its share of top-quality movies. 

Issue One: This movie was rather disturbing for young audiences 

The main character gets tricked into lifting a log that an animal is hiding under by vulture type dinosaurs with large teeth. The animal is then eaten alive! -The main dinosaur is told to kill a human boy by his presumably good father -A boy unintentionally pulls the head off of a massive insect, which dies (well, that was pointless) -The main character, Arlo, is visibly bruised and bloody in scenes -And his father dies in a flood -And his mother is show weak, and overexerted

Issue Two: Animation

The animation in 'The Good Dinosaur', I felt was very strange. The animation is very realistic in parts, and there are some gorgeous nature scenes reminiscent of something you would see from National Geographic. Sometimes I found it hard to tell if something was animated or filmed traditionally. And then there were poorly animated cartoon dinosaurs. The combination did not mix at all. I felt almost as if Pixar was showing off its animation skills without caring about character integration or plot.

Issue Three: Yep, the plot.

Pixar has had some really great ideas. The Good Dinosaur, however, had a ridiculously simplistic plot that seemed to cater to 6 year olds. A six year old plot, with 10 year old violence.

Issue Four: Voices and dialogue

Throughout most of the movie, the main character, a dinosaur named Arlo could be heard whining, complaining, or yelling as he got injured. Where are the nuances in the plot. Where are the communications and dialogues that make you really grow close to the characters (such as in Frozen or Up).

Something was definitely missing from the Good Dinosaur. Hopefully, Pixar can get their act together. The movie started off well enough, with some cute scenes of Arlo's parents watching him hatch but then went steadily downhill from there.

Rating: 1.7/5 stars

Pixar's latest feature wonders what life would have been like if the asteroid that had killed the dinosaurs hadn't hit Earth. According to writers Peter Sohn (who also directed), Erik Benson, Meg LeFauve, Kelsey Mann, and Bob Peterson, it would have been like a western movie, with dinosaurs as farmers, cowboys, and outlaws. That's not a story, it's an idea, and a half-baked one at that. Sohn and company, whose prior credits consist mainly of grunt work for Pixar (animator, storyboard artist, additional voices etc.), were pathetically unready for prime time, and the result of their blown opportunity is an unrelieved disaster.

First and foremost, "The Good Dinosaur" is an excruciating bore, with no story whatsoever, and inhabited by dull characters.

Secondly, what happened to the basic premise highlighted in the trailers and the film's opening act of what could have been had that asteroid not hit 66 million years ago...the writers dangled a candy before audiences of mind-boggling potential, and then totally abandoned it to offer up a mundane tale with plot elements that have been done to death several times over. It was a story that didn't need the what-if-dinosaurs-had-survived setup, a story that could have just as easily have worked if any other main character had been featured as its protagonist. That's my biggest point of contention (besides many other higgles) with this film - in the quest of showcasing human traits and making the story identifiable, the main character ultimately has no defining appeal, something most Pixar characters possess despite their stories rooted in human realism.

And finally, regardless how dinosaurs might have evolved, T-Rexs couldn't have suddenly turned all affable, and no way would human have become rabid, sniffing dogs - alright now I'm nitpicking, but that's the level of frustration this film evokes.

I've never reviewed before but made an account just for this. My 4 and a half year old daughter was a mess after this movie, my 4 year old niece was worse. It was an emotional onslaught for the kids. Very few light hearted moments to break up to constant high intensity of it. Everything from parents dying, loneliness, everything trying to kill them and sad goodbyes. It was barely punctuated by any humour, and the "happy ending" was an afterthought after a sad goodbye that kicked my girl right in the feels and broke her down. I could hear kids crying all around the cinema through it and more than one family left early. At the end half the kids were in their parents laps, including my own. 

I can see what they were going for, but they fell short. Maybe for kids around 10, but for the demographic it was targeted at....no thanks.

Pixar did their job with the animation, but the storyline is so far beneath Disney that they should be ashamed and embarrassed to attach their name to it. They have toys representing the characters already in the Disney stores, but nobody who has seen the show would want the reminder of it. The PG rating puzzled me at first, but it's deserved, in my opinion, for mean-spirited eating of live creatures, humor situated around peeing, depictions of joy in hallucinating after eating red berries, and unnecessarily intense drama and emotion throughout. There is no musical score to speak of and a very narrow, if any, market for this hideous movie, unsuitable for all ages.

I took my 4 year old daughter to see this movie because she loves dinosaurs. After seeing the previews I thought she would really enjoy it and It seemed like it would be a safe and entertaining child's movie. It appeared to me it would be like a Finding Nemo but with dinosaurs. I was WRONG. The creators started out on the right path but then in a blink of an eye sent it burning to the ground. *SPOILER* the scene that really ruined it for me was when the boy and the dinosaur ate the rotten fruit which made them trip out and hallucinate. The first few minutes were tolerable but then it just kept getting weirder and weirder. It was a completely worthless scene that was inappropriate for a child's movie, regardless of the point the film makers were trying to make. There are plenty of other ways they could have made their point without sending a child's character through a shroom induced trip. If that wasn't enough the violence and language was out of line for a child's movie as well. Stuff like "I'm going to kill you" and "I drowned him in my own blood" I mean seriously? If I had known that there was scenes and language like this I would have never taken my 4 year old to see this. I had really high hopes for this, it's sad that there are adults especially in the film making business that think content like that is appropriate for children.

1. This is not a Pixar movie. What is that Indian shot film in the begging of the movie mean any way? I almost though they played the wrong tape, and what is that Thank you letter for? It is only good if this was a good movie but it is not, which makes that thank you letter looks like a beggar. 2. The kid is a totally screw up who can't do anything right. He killed his dad they he blame on the little one. He can't even take a fight on it and fell in the river and for some reason he survived and made friends with the little kid and went back home, end of the story. The transition of the story line is not there, there is no soul of this movie. 3. The only up side of this movie is the amazing graphics, one of the best I even seen in years but is that worth 15$ and 2 hours to watch? My answer is no. I rather spend that 15$ as gas money, and enjoy some state parks for 2 hours. 4. Steve is rolling in his grave...

Totally disappointed in Disney/Pixar. The Good Dinosaur was too disturbing for young children (Lets watch the cute animal with the big eyes get eaten alive) and too boring for older kids and adults.Why is there a drug scene in a kid's movie that makes drugs look like a lot of fun?

For What age group was this movie made. My 5 year old Grandson asked to leave because he didn't like it. He never has asked to leave before a movie is over. 

I expected the same quality as Toy Story, and Finding Nemo. Boy was I wrong!

The opening accompanying cartoon was also very scary and definitely not for little kids.
