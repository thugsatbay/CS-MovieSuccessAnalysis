### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with "negative" marks, earning scores of "1 out of 15" likes.

So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. 

Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. 

The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!

There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.

I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. 

I've got enough already.

How real is "Straight Outta Compton" when the movie totally omits the fact that Dr. Dre beat the hell out of his full-time/part-time girlfriend/singerMichel'le?

According to Michel'le in interviews and in her Lifetime movie, Dr Dre repeatedly physically abused her on an ongoing basis.

She was a significant presence in Dr. Dre's early years and yet no mention of her at all in the movie? She does not exist because representing her would make Dre look like the horrible person he is and not the glorified hood rat this movie portrays him as.

This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty. 

It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?

You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements.

I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie.

Gosh what the hell is going on with this movie?.

It ain't worth watching!.

"Straight Outta Compton" portrays the life of ruthless beggars who abruptly rose to fame as a result of their infamous vulgarity.

Everything is boring and disgusting about this bad and violent movie.

The music really sucked and the acting was artificial.

The few enjoyable things that lustful adults could temporarily enjoy are the naked prostitutes and the blow job scene.

I think this ain't a musical biography but rather a story of evil men who enjoy pornography and who fantasize about committing every kind of sin.

REALLY IT IS A GREAT SHAME!.

I am not a big fan of N.W.A and their music does not interest me. I have to admit that after seeing this movie I was overwhelmed with dismay. It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film.

Alas what a boring film!.

From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me.

Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult.

What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels .

Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money.

So I know people within the music industry that have been in it for over 20 years. I usually have access to V.I.P./backstage....

So that being said, when this came out quite a few of my musician buddies mentioned they had been around N.W.A. in those days or knew people close to them. Their responses though were not so kind. They mentioned quite a bit of this movie is made up/Hollywood fluff just to sell it. So don't take this as an actually history piece, because it is NOT. Pretty much all of them were disgusted by it. Think the real story will ever happen? Most likely not.

Sure, I grew up to their music, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish watching this.

Straight Outta Compton tells the bad way of life about NWA corrupt artists who seem so happy to be bad,aggressive,violent and depraved. They enjoy their perversion and rejoice in being angry and ruthless thugs. What A Great Shame!. The music in Straight Outta Compton Is Completely Disgusting Just Like This Nonsense Movie.

I know that rebels should not resort to any violence if they want to get their rights. Those dirty rascals always swear and enjoy being evil and corrupt and they suck so bad indeed.

"Straight Outta Compton" is not a musical biography nor a drama,it is rather a semi porno movie.

"Straight Outta Compton" tells the story of five contemptible outlaws who have been living a dissolute life where everything is allowed.

This movie takes place in Compton in the mid 80s.I am totally astounded:"Were Black Men So Aggressive And Shameless during the 1980s?".

What is the theme of this rubbish movie?.

Those five Black narcissistic individuals do not respect themselves,nor they respect others and they shamelessly act (swearing,acting like horny sex maniacs and perverts).

Alas!. This was the worst movie I have ever seen!.

Straight Outta Compton is the worst movie of 2015.

Don't believe the Hype!.

It is enormously over-rated and too boring.

A commercial movie with sex,nude women and fellatio.

Worst Drama ever seen and the worst acting ever!.

5 Black scum men who sees no shame in practicing shameless sex ,drinking too much alcohol,using drug,swearing too much and enjoying seeing graphic nudity of shameless sluts.

This movie was previously rated X (for the blow job scene).But even the rating is unfair.It deserves NC-17 for all the disgusting things in it.

For all of these above reasons,Straight Outta Compton is truly the worst and most over-rated movie of 2015.

I think that if you're going to make a movie like this then you need to show all sides, the good and the bad. 

-Like Eazy and Dre's disrespectful, repugnant "black b*tches" comments (No wonder Dre seemingly never had a problem with Eminem's infamous "black b*tch" lyrics). 

-Like Dre's refusal to have anything to do with his black kids. You put your white kids into private school while the black ones are stuck in the ghetto. Doesn't the fakery just gnaw at you, Dre? As a black woman, I have zero respect for you. 

-Like the abuses that women faced at the hands of Dre, that he only apologized for when this hokey movie was about to come out. 

Aside from Ice Cube, a family man who doesn't deny his kids or disrespect black women (at least not anymore), these are not the people you want your kids to emulate. Watching this movie was painful because even though I grew up to this music and used to have at least a modicum of appreciation for it all, as an adult I see the damage that it's done to an entire generation, and to watch these men painted as martyrs and heroes and such literally turned my stomach. It's SO FAKE. You can see through it even if you don't know anything about the real rappers. I'd advise you all to do your research on these people. Dre especially does not deserve respect or even a portion of your paycheck.

So glad I waited until it played on HBO. I would never buy this junk.

The movie was poor, I was expecting a real rag to riches story and the films to portray the troubles of easy e, as he made nma.Instead it hown him to be a money grabber, when in fact that was dr dre and ice cube.

The movie is a typical " lets make black people cool" movie, gloryfying mindless violence, over the top swearing, and thuggery, its not cool, its not big and its not clever.

It really is a poor portrayal of what could have been a half decent movie, It if would have employed decent actors, stuck to a real life story and made the characters more likable then it might have made it but it was just another " lets glorify black men as being cool thugs" movie. Boring, over rated, tedious, and had every stereotype under the sun to go with it. who ever rates this movie above a 1 is either a mindless teenager or someone who knows absolutely nothing about movies.

I cannot stress how disappointed I was with this movie. I expected a powerful, raw and real view into the true story of the revolution of hip hop/rap. I was quite young when all of this actually occurred but (growing up in the 90's) music was evolving in new and significant ways that was truly exciting. As far as the stories behind the music we were left with what little we heard on MTV news, read in the few gossip columns of magazines and word of mouth. That's why I was eager to see this movie. With social media now we know every step everyone takes-and they are aware of that-so I was looking forward to seeing a depiction of a time before that. A behind the scenes look at what really went on when nobody was looking-because then compared to now-nobody was.

...Instead what I got was 2 1/2 hours of horrible acting! I've seen more character in infomercials than in this movie. Seriously I'm more emotionally invested in if Bob can get that burnt cheese off his non-stick pan than I was of the deaths in this movie. The actors seemed as if every single blink was scripted, nothing seemed natural or real at all-which to me is important when you're portraying something that actually happened! 

If the intentions of this movie were to take a real life, hard, emotional yet exciting revolutionary story and make it seem fake and drab it gets 10 stars. But it wasn't, therefore I give it 1. It could've and should've been something great.

I really tried to look at this movie with an open mind although this type of movie isn't really my cup of tea anyway so to speak. It was awful to say the least with no cohesive plot whatsoever! It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the "thug" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on "Hip Hop" culture. Just not a good movie in any way, shape, or form. Do not go see! If you want to see a great movie with an African American cast that is uplifting and shows what is admirable about our great society then go see "War Room"!!

{Straight Outta Compton }is a movie everyone must avoid.It has a lot of offensive words ( Profaning Jesus As mother fuc.er) by a blasphemous white man who often shouts in the face of his own dad and describes his own dad as a (mother fuc.er)!!!!. This film instead of teaching people how to respect others ,it has a destructive theme of corrupting the youth and speaks in favor of using random drugs . Parents Beware!. It has unnecessary violence especially against women. Feminists must beware of this movie. Furthermore,there is no single didactic theme in this movie except corrupting teens and instigating boys to rebel and torture their own beloved fathers. All I know is that peaceful rebels who want to get their rights should never ever resort to violence. Concerning the music,it is not my type.This movie's plot is weak. I could not find any suspense in this movie at all except boredom.

If by voting this a 3 or lower I could send the real life versions of these losers along with their shameless "gimme ma money dawg" sellout "actors" to jail, I'd still vote a 1, and so only because I cannot cast a lower vote.

What's there to say? If the reviewers who gave this a 10 are paid to raise the rating (and this is most certainly the overwhelming case) then please do not have children! You are moral sellouts. If on the other hand you actually enjoyed this movie, sorry, but you're an idiot. 

A story--er nightmare, about scumbag filth who prostituted their way through the 80's and 90's as the moral fabric of society was being systematically destroyed by a new brand of media and television, and used this gap in evolution, as these types always use any possible opportunity to capitalize where the least amount of intellect or work is necessary, to make themselves downright rich so they can then spend the rest of their useless, oxygen-thieving carbon waste lives to further deconstruct decency by telling their tale of filth to the world with actors who don't have the skills necessary to clean a truck stop restroom. The lower your IQ the higher your rating will be. For those who have not seen it and wish to retain some sense of dignity, don't even watch this on pirated sites. You'll lose over an hour of your life for nothing. Read a book instead - even a comic book! Your time will be better spent.

This movie is testament to the fact that this generation is lost and worthless. Anything good to come out of the last 2 decades seems so rare that it deserves a statue. One can only hope that this trend ends and soon, so the world can start rebuilding a sense of pride and decency again. Yuck! Ugh! Blah! No amount of Listerine rinses will help you get the taste of this movie out of your mouth.

This movie tells the story of 5 corrupt musicians who live a depraved life and are happy about it!. This bad biography film is about the life of the Rap group NWA. The story basically follows the life of Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and Ice Cube.

The film is so boring and have a slow pace . The women nudity and the hardcore could please horny men for a temporary period of time.

After seeing the movie I was really disappointed because I did not see any drama in it and the boredom in it really kills and sucks so bad.

This is a typical movie that glorifies one party and demonizes another. There are three sides of the story: party A, party B, and the truth. Cops had just as much reason to target young black men as young black men had reason to target innocent people in the streets. The thing that should not be glorified encouraged in young people who are inspired by this film is the terrible attitudes and general lack of respect for anyone. Aside from the dominating racial theme of this movie, the truth of the events that took place is stretched to put it lightly. Fact checking any number of the scenes that were portrayed will lead you to see that the facts were warped in order to convey the story that they wanted rather than the truth. Along with the fictitious plot-line, the acting is cheesy and not believable. There is no stand out performance and one can expect that, as this is many of these young actors' first big time film. This movie is a renter at best; the only saving grace is the music.

Not that their life stories aren't bad or respected it's just the movie was all about rewarding ignorance I feel like anyone that watched this has been tainted it's not the cast, I respect some of the cast it just put the wrong message out to people especially the ones underage that will watch this. The swearing, drugs and violence were a huge impact on this and now more teens will do it monkey see monkey do.

...I had to watch the movie since I actually liked at the time some of the music of NWA, especially the title track of the movie. Yet what happened after-wards, after their success, is just a sell out to make a bunch of money with no more attitude than all the others. 

And now the movie and it would deserve just one star, yet the music brings back some memories when things could have been changed in a different way than they wanted to. Look at them now, nowadays...thats all that there is to say about the characters of the movie. 

The acting is typical for the gang banging crowds nowadays and so it can be seen on every street-corner in major cities and is nothing special and that I mean not in a good way. If that was meant to change things, well Sirs, screw you! The story itself, well I do not know what is true and what is not, but like stated above, in the end it came to make more money than others. What they have changed is just that violence and negativity can bring success, that youths of today look up to them what they could do and want to do as well...THAT is what they have changed and just because Compton is nowadays almost everywhere, does not make this a success in changes, but a success in stupidity. And so it does not matter to me if you become legit than after-wards and make movies about your awful youth and how you can succeed and then make funny movies, like Ice Cube....

So what remains is the music...there was once a dream of a few guys who wanted to change something, what they have changed is to have today an attitude, which became wide spread, for the big buck. Nothing wrong with it, yet don't be surprised when you get now the attitude that you spread and so...please straight BACK to Compton and please try again! 

For former NWA fans a must, for people who love the attitude nowadays a must, for normalos who aren't impressed but rather appalled by the success of a negative attitude and the real change they created, a no show!

Ask five narcissistic, self centered, selfish, juvenile, thugs to  create a movie about themselves and this is just the garbage that will  come out. Most is obviously not accurate but embellished by the  creators to make themselves look like heroes. And they are far from  heroes. Sure, they were angry, but now that they all are millionaires,  the whole thing seems very self-serving. It makes me wonder what kind  of person would be proud of such a dismal portrayal of their life. I  think NWA now stands for Not Worth Attending. Graphic nudity, sex,  drugs, violence...what great role models these gentlemen are for the  new generation. And the fact that extra security has to be assigned to  the theaters showing this garbage speaks volumes for the type of people  this crap attracts.

As a white Englishman, I loved N.W.A. back in the day mainly due to their controversy and anti-establishment lyrics. This is exactly why I loved The Sex Pistols and punk rock 10 years before that.

But this movie is just a con job, it's so disingenuous, and false. There are so many facts, and people ignored in this ego trip of a movie it insults our intelligence. But with the group involved as producers, and advisers, what do you expect but a pompous and narcissistic movie.

The two stars are for the music and the cool Lowriders in the movie, but also the feeling of the late 80's is very well realised and the gig performances are pretty well staged.

Ghurghgh. I loved N.W.A. for their gall, anger and methods, but hated their misogyny. Still, this film focuses on that, disses MC Ren's abilities to lift the group after Dre left, and yeah, there's more misogyny here, still. Drab. Sad. The best bits are of the band shaping their first album. The rest should be read in books and preferably forgotten. It's not hard to see why Ice Cube went on to surpass what Dre did later, even on his first solo album. I wish one would hear more dissing of Dre courtesy of Eazy-E, buuut--Eazy's dead, so Dre's words take precedence, I guess. And there's even a whole buckload of distasteful ad for beats headphones at the end of the film. Truly bad.
