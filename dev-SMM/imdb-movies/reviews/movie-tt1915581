### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, butas Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, "That's what I doit's not who I am." Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term "self-actualization" in a review of "Magic Mike"; I told you you might be shocked.

At any rate, plenty of folks (like the pathetic woman who was sitting behind me in the theater, the one who clapped like a poorly trained seal, guffawed, and cackled any time the least bit of male skin appeared on screen) will go see this movie because of all the hype about the hot male bodies in various states of undressand they will certainly enjoy the film on that very basic level. But let's be honest here, folksthis is a Stephen Soderbergh filmand Soderbergh does not use sex and titillation gratuitously. The plot is compelling, the film is well written and masterfully directed, and Channing Tatum proves that he is much, much more than a hot body and a pretty face. For his sake, here's hoping that "Magic Mike" can propel him along a career path similar to those of other handsome actors who managed to overcome "Movie Star" looks to prove that they were genuine actors. Like Brad Pitt.

Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a "male stripper movie," like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a "gay cowboy movie." This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, "Worst movie ever." On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.

To state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, "Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.

The cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never really liked in the films he starred in before, but he is just phenomenal in this film. Horn, on the other hand, seemed to come out from nowhere, but her rapport with Tatum is terrific. Let's also not forget about Matthew McConaughey. Even though he isn't in the film that much, he steals every single scene he's in. He's just that good.

MAGIC MIKE will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to "a movie for the ladies." MAGIC MIKE is funny and dramatic when it needs to be, but the main reason it succeeds is because of the cast. Overall, MAGIC MIKE is a very good film. Just don't expect a lot of stripping.

I am going to make my review short, sweet, and to the point. Something Magic Mike was not. As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next... NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY... but one of the main characters in the movie has a HUGE LIFE ISSUE, and they NEVER SOLVE IT, they give you nothing... just "WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, THE END"

As I watched "Magic Mike", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.

And then it ended.

I was confused. So many things didn't make sense. So many questions were left unanswered. Where was the conflict's resolution? What happened to Adam? When did Mike and Brooke fall in love? What was with Tarzan's character? Did I have the wrong mindset? 

The problem with "Magic Mike" is that it attempts to appeal to every form of movie watcher and, instead, appeals only to the ladies fanning themselves while mesmerized by abs and biceps. While Mike (a surprisingly decent Channing Tatum) is an interesting character, the movie's structure and story suffer from Steven Soderbergh's direction.

1. "Magic Mike" has no goal. No themes, no morals, no bottom-line. We see hints of anti-drug sentimentality, and Soderbergh draws a little attention to the effects of the male stripper world on the male mind. But these elements are only hints, and are abandoned by the time the credits roll. Mike doesn't regret his actions as a stripper, only that he continued to be one into his 30's. He dabbles in drugs in one (hyper-extended and annoying) montage-esque scene, but that event too has few direct consequences.

All this would be okay if the movie was a comedy. However...

2. "Magic Mike" isn't funny. Not by any stretch of the imagination. We have some witty remarks that are bound to induce some smiles, but the only laughs come from people's "shock" from the dance numbers. There are no jokes, no slapstick humor, and the dance numbers really aren't that amusing (to a male). The only truly funny scene is when Adam (a bored looking Alex Pettyfer) is first backstage with Tarzan and the other strippers.

If this movie lacks a drama's thematic elements and a comedy's laughs, then it must be a romance, right?

3. "Magic Mike" isn't romantic. In fact, Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) don't let any sparks fly at all. A relationship between the two isn't even a possibility until they get into their first shouting match, near (what I assume to be) the movie's climax. Their relationship is never given time to grow because the movie's first half tries to build a story around Adam and Mike's relationship. However, the second half drops Adam almost completely and attempts to bring in Brooke. Both relationships fall flat, not to mention Adam ends up as a terrible human being.

In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies because Soderbergh shoots high and misses everything. Also, "Magic Mike" is peppered with extended "erotic" dance numbers that add nothing to the plot and exist purely to satisfy the target audience: middle-aged women. These scenes, in addition to the movie's schizophrenic lack of direction, will disappoint any movie lover's hopes of seeing a film that provides insight into the mind of a male stripper.

At least, the audience could have used a decent ending.

A good poster, and an effective trailer, make excellent marketing tools for a truly awful movie.

Anything good is in the trailer. The only scenes that are the slightest bit interesting are on stage in the club. The rest of the time it's actors spouting bad dialogue with little or nothing to do. Classic lines like "Hey" and "Hey do you want to get something to eat?". They walk and talk. They sit and talk. They drink and talk. They stare toward the right or left or look at the ocean like it's supposed to mean something.

Some of the original music is interesting and fits. The film has a golden tone appearance to the scenes outside of the club which becomes distracting and adds nothing. 

There's a scene after the sorority fight scene that seems out of place before the confrontation in the club. There is no reason to like the thinly drawn characters, and even less reason to like the movie. It's too long, often boring and feels like it is yet to be written. Steven Soderbergh is tied for the most overrated director of this generation.

Don't waste your time, money, or eyes on this one.

Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants "something more" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.

I won't spoiler the actual film but here's what its about: Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a construction worker by day and male stripper by night. He meets pretty boy Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn) at work and gets Adam a stripping job at the strip joint owned by Dallas ("I see a lot of law breakers"...must a say HIS name?). Romantic fireworks explode between characters and Adam gets into trouble along the way.

Here's how I'm going to analyze: 

Story: All I can about the story is that it is your typical romantic 21st century Hollywood film. You can predict the whole movie and ending very easily.

Characters: These characters were walking cardboards. Mike, Adam, Brooke, Joanna, Norah, even Tarzan, etc HAD NO PERSONALITY! The character that was somewhat interesting was Dallas and he stripped the least (sorry ladies). I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times.

Acting: I hated to judge this part because there isn't much to judge. The acting is...mediocre at best. Channing Tatum plays the role he plays in every film of his: the good guy with little personality. I feel Tatum CAN really act but he needs to expand his range like Johnny Depp does or Heath Ledger use to. Adam Pettyfer has tried to expand his range (like in "Beastly")but the kid, as good looking as he is, just can't act. Cody Horn was the weakest link. She'll probably be the next Julia Stiles, meaning she'll be cast in the same role in every film (good films probably) next to good looking guys even though she can't act.

These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. The only song in the film I could remember was "Its Raining Men". The directing had some shaky camera. I remember that. The visuals were...okay. If you like naked men.

Overall, the film was..."eh". I was bored through most of it and I left the theater with no intentions to ever see it again. I gave the film three stars out of ten. The film needed more "magic" in storytelling and originality then "Mike" just being your typical Hollywood dream guy that doesn't really exist.

So many elements that could have made this a truly original movie. Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all, entertaining and little, very little else.

This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.

First let's get the nude issue out of the way. There is only one full frontal in the movie--it's off to the side, is partially blocked and is probably faked. It's also very funny. There's mostly butt shots only but all are from Tatum, Pettyfer and Adam Rodriguez. This movie is NOT about the nudity. The movie moves slow (although I was never bored) and main events happen off screen OR are never explained! Still the movie works. For one thing all the acting is good. I was surprised at how good Tatum was. I never thought he could act till this. He captures his character perfectly. Pettyfer was equally good as Adam. Even Matthew McConaughey was good as the group's owner named Dallas. The strip acts themselves are incredible. All the guys are in good shape and Tatum shows some moves that are jaw-dropping! However they're not shot in an exploitive fashion. They're done in a matter of fact way that actually makes them seem quite funny. This movie (script wise) shows us nothing new but it was well-made and entertaining. This is not just for women and gay men--I think everyone would enjoy it. I give it a 7.

my girlfriends and I were so excited to see this, we were thinking it was going to be a fun movie with some hot guys. Let me put it to you this way. In the beginning all the women in the theater were cheering and clapping like they were in a real strip club so I thought yaay this is going to be fun, then after the first hour there was no more clapping or cheering, you could hear crickets and I felt the same way. By the end, nothing gets resolved for anyone and you're just left thinking "what just happened" I give it a 2 because SOME of the dance numbers were fun and Channing was very nice to look at. As another reviewer said, if you rent the movie, fast forward to the strip dance scenes I promise you won't miss anything else. It's sad because I really wanted to like this movie :(

Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking "You can't just get enough of pretty naked men". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of "Let's make a good film" attitude rather than purely "Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club"... It made me sad - I was counting on something that would be a start of amazing acting careers for Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and Alex Pettyfer. Well, in my opinion this film won't help. Period.

It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same "the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie". I couldn't disagree more.

I went into the movie with basically no expectations. In my opinion, Soderbergh is completely hit or miss. He has classics like Sex, Lies, and Videotape and stinkers like The Girlfriend Experience. This is the only movie of his aside from Sex, Lies, and Videotape that I have truly loved through and through.

I don't know what people are talking about criticizing the acting. This is one of the best roles I have seen Tatum pull. Matthew McConaughy is perfect as the head slime ball. The lead who plays "The Kid" or Adam is a completely believable representation of every guy who is in his shoes in the world. And the sister Brooke, while coming off as a little obnoxious with her grim stares around the beginning of the movie, had a tough role to play but she did it with flying colors as well - by the end of the film she becomes a quite endearing figure.

The soundtrack was good. The camera work and editing was innovative. There were some really cool montage-esque segments towards the middle of the movie that actually worked really well and were pretty stylish. The cinematography during the dance sequences are especially vibing and impressive as well.

People complain there is no plot or ending - I think these people must be lacking depth or lacking a brain in general. From the very start, the movie flowed very well, a slow and smooth grind into the world that we will end up spending the rest of it's length existing in. The movie maintains an impressive realism through the majority of it's scenes - instead of trying to feel like a blockbuster feature, it feels like what it would feel like in reality. The focus of the plot changes slightly throughout the film, but stays open and interesting. And the ending, I don't think could have been more perfect - if you take nothing from it, well, you must be missing a lot of things in life.

I dunno what else to say! This is absolutely one of my favorite Soderbergh movies and easily one of the best movies I have seen this year in 2012 so far. I recommend it to anyone with brains.

I went to see this movie last night with some girlfriends. We had some cocktails beforehand and were primed to drool over the hunky men doing their stripteases. How sadly disappointed we were. The lead actress had one facial expression the entire time. The dialog was hardly developed and gave me the feeling of bored students reading a book aloud with no emotion. I eagerly waited for the next strip scene and while the choreography was good, it really wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie. There was no chemistry between Brooke and Mike and am I the only one who was disturbed by Brooke watching her brother strip? Frankly, I'm surprised at how many good reviews this movie received. I really wanted to like it, even if just for Matthew and Channing. Even though I went in knowing the plot was not the greatest (from someone who saw it before me), I was surprised at how truly bad it was. Wait for the DVD and use your fast forward!

I found nothing to like about this movie. It is billed firstly as a comedy and then as a drama. There was no comedy. I didn't laugh. The script was dreadful. There was no drama. Why did anyone think it would be a good idea to make this film? This is the worst film I have seen this year. My only purpose in writing this review is to warn you not to go and see this film.

The acting was wooden. The story line weak. The soundtrack abysmal. The dialogue dire. I was bored. I kept hoping the movie would have at least one redeeming feature. It fails miserably on all counts. I want my money back.

This movie has blinded people with lots of washboard abs. I was one of them, and I flocked to the theatre. While the stripping scenes were fun and well choreographed, that was the movies only good quality. 

They had three plot lines going during the movie, all were not developed enough and it made the entire story scattered. Furthermore, they didn't give those story lines appropriate endings, so we just ended with breakfast and kissing and called it an effing day. What a waste. 

Channing Tatum was okay in his role, but there were times where he stumbled over his words and I was left wondering if that was an error and poorly edited, or if it was left in to make it seem more natural.

The sound editing was weird to me, conversations from the upcoming scene began before the shot of the ending scene was over.

The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: "A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money." "Magic Mike" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.

Soderbergh crafts a powerful but almost self-defeating film that I doubt will be a huge popularity winner due to its unconventional story. (Sidenote: why is it that filmmakers can make critically-acclaimed masterpieces about female strippers/prostitutes, like "Leaving Las Vegas", but if the g-string is on the other gender it's just goofy fun?) Due to its deceptive marketing, "Magic Mike" is passed off as crowd-pleasing entertainment, but it's really a very sobering look at life with more introspective moments than laughs.

Channing Tatum plays Mike, a guy with the bod of a Greek god, probably not very educated but with a very smart, creative ambition: to build artistic furniture. Somehow, instead, he ends up thrusting his pelvis on stage for screaming ladies. Enter Adam (Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year-old kid who, like many 19-year-olds, doesn't have a clue. Mike takes Adam under his wing and introduces him to the night life, all the while promising Adam's sister Brooke (Cody Horn) that he'll take care of Adam.

If you can see where this is going, then great. That's the point. "Magic Mike" does something that few films have the guts to do. It sets up a predictable situation and then takes us through exactly that. No wacky, contrived plot twists necessary. Instead it focuses on how different people react and change when confronted with a predictable set of events.

Another thing this film does, better than any other I've seen in recent memory, is that it gives us REAL dialogue. I'm talking about the scenes between Mike & Brooke. It's every bit as real as something you'd experience in real life, right down to the stammering, the awkward fidgeting, the "flubbed lines". I put that in quotations because I'm not sure if the script was written that way, or if Tatum actually flubbed a few lines and Soderbergh left them in. My point is that the dialogue & chemistry between those two is so believable you'd think they didn't have a camera on them.

"Magic Mike" is not for everyone. It can't be accurately summed up with some exuberant catchphrase like "Laugh out loud funny!" or "A tragic masterpiece!" or "Nail biting suspense!" Also I would say that this is a very uncomfortable date movie, a very uncomfortable bro movie, and it's probably too heavy for a fun, gal's night out movie. If you do see it, it's probably best watched alone so you can really soak in the personal story it's telling. On an individual level I think we can all relate to the idea of being sidetracked by the pursuit of a dream, rather than the dream itself, regardless of if we're guys wearing buttless cowboy pants in front of 200 squealing, undersexed women.

The usherette tittered when I bought my ticket. 'Why do you laugh?' I asked. 'Because only girls are watching this'. Clearly this is someone who doesn't believe in the universality of cinema. Yes, Steven Soderbergh's latest features male strippers, and yes it will appeal more to a certain demographic, but so will every film. Audiences may be disparate but films are androgynous. Or should be. 

As 'Magic' Mike, charming Channing Tatum naturally gets top billing, but the film revolves around Adam (rising star Alex Pettyfer). Adam is a congenital loser, the kind of guy who refuses to wear a tie and wonders why he can't sustain a job. He lives with his sister, Brooke (Cody Horn), whose acting conveys a suspicion of men, presumably because she has only her wayward brother as a yardstick. 

Adam finds work on a construction site with Mike, who sees the desperation of Adam's situation and entices him to join his exotic dancing troupe, Xquisite, led by Dallas (Matthew McConaughey). Dallas astutely exploits Adam's naivety by branding him 'The Kid', an amateurish, sloppy act, which the ladies love. The next three months are a non-stop orgy of girls, booze and drugs: everything a man like Adam could wish for. 

This lifestyle has lost its appeal for Mike, now 30, who only took up professional undressing to become a bespoke furniture salesman. He no longer wishes to hold out for the phantom 10% of the business Dallas keeps promising him, but poor credit keeps him on the pole. (Tatum again stars in a role which brings out his effortless charisma and sweetness.)

McConaughey recently impressed me in William Friedkin's 'Killer Joe', and now this film has completely changed my mind about him. He's gone from my dud to my stud list in just two films. And Pettyfer works because he doesn't work, if you see what I mean. Although an ex-model, he's not 'stripper material' (not that I'd know much about that sort of thing), yet there's a naturalness to his acting, which works. 

Although not in the same league as some of Soderbergh's other titles (notably 'Traffic' and 'Out of Sight'), there's enough going on to warrant a viewing. Characters are well written, lives intersect in an unforced manner, motivations are believable. There's plenty of saucy (and quite impressive) dancing to keep the majority of this film's audience happy, but there's also a decent story for those who aren't watching exclusively for nudity.

Surprisingly, I went to see this movie on my own free will (not dragged by my girlfriend, not with family, or even friends for good laughs). I was not there to see the stripping, but there to see if this movie had any sort of a plot. Here's the main focus of the plot: Mike is an ordinary man by day and stripper by night. Although it may not seem like it, Mike has a dream of owning his own business with stripping as his only means of funding that dream. He then mentors a younger co-worker (Adam) in the life and style of stripping (good and bad). As the movie progresses, Mike becomes aware of Adam's sudden change of personality, behavior and the movie shows the darker sides of his night job. From then on, Mike wonders about whether he needs to leave this lifestyle or continue to do what he does best.

Seems like a generic plot but it does have a nice flow to it. Tatum really brings out his character. There are some good laughs and definitely not as explicit as some would've thought. We don't know much of the supporting cast, outside of Adam, Brooke, Dallas and Tobias. Matt McConaughey's character is very good and yet very underutilized throughout the movie. That is one of the cons I have for the movie. I also think the casting for Brooke was very odd as Cody Horn doesn't seem comfortable in this role, nor is she any good for this role.

Overall, it was a good movie. I know some of you will judge me for watching this and that's okay. I'm an avid movie goer and I felt this was an enjoyable movie to watch (even if it's targeted to females 13-50)

I can only say that my children could have written better dialog than the crap that was put up on screen. No depth in any of the characters,no conflict to move this thing forward. Don't waste your money unless all you want to see is the dancers. then again, you can get that all for free on the internet, so its not even worth it for that.

The story is very weak at best, the "love" interest creates absolutely zero compassion or desire within the audience to even care if they end up together or not.

Unneeded forced drug use at a sorority dance job. No real situation has a bunch of guys hanging at a sorority house in the other room while the male revue is dancing for the girls. 

All i can say is thank goodness I rarely go to the movies if this is what is being pushed on audiences.

Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims "I was hoping it was all a joke." I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, "No, but it is pretty funny." He's also right.

"Magic Mike" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.

Shortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.

Also as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the "proper" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.

I am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.

Soderbourgh's made a movie that really seems to get the joy of stripping. The scenes that are the movie's reason for being I have to admit are very well shot, well lit, well choreographed, and really get at the joy and pure giddiness that both the guys feel performing and the joy that the women in the audience feel watching them. They're the centerpieces of the film, and the film whatever else you may or may not feel about Channing Tatum's character or the rather vacuous supporting characters orbiting him---those scenes really pop and bring the movie to life. Its unfortunate that everything that's in between those scenes feels like so much filler meant to beef up the film's dramatic quotient so that its not just seen as that dude stripper movie. (Not unlike how Soderbourgh's previous film "Haywire" also only really came to life during the various action scenes of its main character springing to life and doing the real fighting scenes that were that movie's reason for being made and how everything else there was also filler--albeit somewhat more entertaining filler) 

I appreciate the efforts that have been taken to make Tatum seem like a three dimensional character with desires to make something of his life that he just can't because of--well various reasons actually (bad credit, not being taken seriously, etc)--none the least is that he can't seem to make up his mind about whether to grow up and pursue a serious adult relationship with an actual woman or continue playing friends with benefits with Olivia Munn's rather fickle and pretty arbitrary character. (or something like that i guess) Tatum like the movie itself is all right---i don't think this is a particularly revelatory performance the way some of the professional reviewers are talking about---he's definitely not John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever here even if their situations and circumstances are similar. (You will not for one second get me to believe that he has even half of Travolta's charisma in that movie here, even if he has the dance moves....frankly Tatum was more Travolta level charismatic in 21 Jump Street.) However Tatum definitely handles the very good monologue Soderbourgh throws at him in the last 20 minutes or so perfectly--and the disillusion that he feels as the movie goes along is believable--although the ending is really pretty inconclusive--its almost as if they didn't wanna end it because they knew a sequel would be imminent--but i don't think there's really any more story to tell here quite honestly. I mean Tatum's character reaches the decision that he makes and then what's left for him or the movie to do except repeat itself with stuff we've already seen? I suppose the sequel could focus entirely on Matthew McConaghey's character or Alex Pettifer's character but neither is really all that fleshed out (no pun intended) to the point that either one could be the main character in their own movie. (although at least McConaghey has a character that could hold your attention with his non-stop patter and admittedly that patter is pretty funny at times.) There's enough in the in between filler scenes that i kinda wish they were better written, or at least better thought out, and not so low key--i understand there was probably an effort to keep all of the non-stripping scenes low energy so to highlight the difference between their club life and their real everyday life--but it just adds to the whole non-club scenes being filler vibe that the film is only too happy to accept. The film isn't bad, its never less than watchable--but really the only time the movie even approaches the level of those stripper scenes is when you see the dancers rehearsing their moves--and not because of the dancing--its just because that seems to be the only other time the movie's energy level actually perks up and manages to even be funny as well, would that the other scenes had as much humor, or any emotion expressed besides Tatum's slightly depressed brooding.

"Magic Mike" has a comedy genre and by seeing this I neither enjoyed nor dishearten a lot. Some of its comedy scenes were good but most of them were below par. When the film movie trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was noticeable as just a "male hooker film, like many others. But "Magic Mike" has its own style and unique contents. For those who haven't been deceived by the film movie trailer yet, Magic Mike is a story of Mike, a persistent man who lifestyle in Florida. To obtain his objectives of beginning up a personalized furniture company, which look like Phil Warhol designs, he functions several projects, one of which is losing. Yes that's right Mike's main income is showing off his human system to a lot of women who are fulfilled to variety his slangy underwear with costs. However, one lady manages to go through the go of cougars, drunks, and dreamers and somehow manages to stimulate something further in him. As for the tale, well it's different from the common really like tale I believed I'd need to look at and actually is a tale of two strippers. One tale specializes in the go up and down of the character known as Adam and his leap into the planet of female's entertainment. The second and perhaps primary tales of course is on the fall and improve of Mike, aspect of such as the enchanting lady you've seen in the movie trailer. Unfortunately both experiences consist of the excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, which the movie seems to market as the only way to have pleasant development. It's difficult for this author to keep in mind surroundings where Adam or Mike weren't put over or without a alcoholic beverages in their hands, which to me is just sad. Although they display the terrifying of treatment usage, Magic Mike also has some visible treatment use and humorousness that I didn't proper take proper. Although it is most likely used to highlight the low aspects of their lifestyle, showing several shots of treatment triggered mountains, sex, and attack is not my concept of pleasant. The actions in this film were downright amazing. Channing Tatum has lately just getting better and better with every film that he has been in. His character in this film is so considerably and interesting that you can't help but want to know more about him. I can mainly say that for all the celebrities as well because every character is so well developed and so considerably that you really get invested into this film. The stripping/dancing moments are the most exciting factors of the film and I linked with myself worn out with everything else. It tries to be more than a stripper film, but it isn't able at it. It's not fun, it's not excellent it's trapped in the center and it seems to be an automated a lot of a lot of your power and power. I think if the film had taken more possibilities and tried to be further, it could have been somewhere along the choices of Appear Night here we are at the stripper market. It's a great misuse of Soderberg's ability.

Mild spoilers follow.

So I decided to take a look at Steven Soderbergh's "Magic Mike" because of both its content matter and potential film historical importance (Soderbergh has announced he is retiring, making this his third to last film) of the work itself. I admit I didn't have terribly high expectations, especially after the weak acting and shallow plot of the last Soderbergh film I saw, the beat-em-up "Haywire"; I was pleasantly surprised by the interesting narrative construction and the seemingly quick and dirty camera-work.

One thing he's known for is having Directed, DP'd (shot), and many of his films himself and from what I can tell, this is no exception. It has the same semi-verite style that began in The Girlfriend Experience and managed to keep my attention despite everything else in Haywire. Creative framing and unusual angles (sometimes even breaking the fundamental rules of cinematography) go wild here to great success. When "the kid" is first brought into a bar by Mike, he's tasked with chatting up two barely of-age girls. Mike arrives and the scene becomes a series of circular low-angle shots that are edited furiously in a dizzying circle. At first, it really bothered me and my film-school educated mind. The constant switching of screen positions and 180-degree violations made my head spin. Then quite suddenly I got it -- It wasn't hard to follow the dialogue, nor did the audience loose a sense of place. We'd seen the space in the beginning of the scene, and it allowed us to "be" intimately involved in the conversation. The swirling edits around the characters helped us to experience the same vague disorientation that "the kid" was. One particular moment I liked was a dialogue sequence shot as a long take as the two characters walked around a shallow sandbar. The camera tracks them 180-degrees as they walk from being half-in-sunlight to being backlit and then back again as they skirt the tiny island. At one point the sunlight shimmers off the water and reflects between the lens and (I assume) ND filter, creating a sparkling flair across the actors. It's a beautiful moment, and not just due to the unusual cinematography -- the dialogue is witty and believable and the actors are natural and comfortable. 

Channing Tatum really came into his own in this one. I haven't, admittedly, been much of a fan of his through his previous acting endeavors. The part of Mike, however, seemed to fit him like a glove. Completely natural and unforced, he delivered an honest and vulnerable performance. It's the kind of breakout that Jim Carrey experienced in The Truman Show. I had assumed that Tatum was just a pretty face. I stand corrected. Cody Horn was excellent as the romantic interest, as was Alex Pettyfer as her little brother, "the kid." Matthew McConaughey's smarmy character Dallas was literally oozing the sexuality and back-room cash-only inuuendo that one would expect from a strip club owner. His confrontation with Tatum's Mike was a particularly well-acted scene.

Narratively it was what you would expect, but I enjoyed the way it was constructed, with the storyline of the starry-eyed kid following a trajectory similar to Mike's past, combined with Mike's own coming-of-age plot and a pleasant romantic sideplot. It reminded me of old Italian neo-realist gems -- it felt like a slice of life, and ended on a up note but without a whole lot of resolution. The dialogue was witty but not forced and felt natural, as if in a documentary. 

Overall, a good film and definitely worth a look.

Yeah Channing Tatum is hot, but the storyline of this movie sucked.. Mike ruined the other guys life by getting him into sleeping around, hard core drugs, etc and he is oh so thankful in the end to be where he is? Like no your life went down the drain why are you happy. Is that what happiness is these days? And I didn't like the girl they used for Brooke as the main girl. This movie was extremely unsatisfying to me. I think they just wanted to make a movie about strippers so everyone would come see it and then realized they had to come up with a plot so they just tried to throw together 3 separate crappy plots. Overall unsatisfying.

I can't believe people are giving this movie rave reviews - I cannot understand that one single bit. This movie goes down as one of the WORST movies I've seen in my 40 years on this earth. 

The main girl (who I had never previously heard of) was not only a terrible actress, but she was uncomfortable to watch.

Speaking of uncomfortable, the dialogue was extremely uncomfortable and awkward. It was as if there was almost no script and the actors were just giving a direction to go and hit certain points and from there they had to ad lib - which they did poorly.

There was not even enough "skin" to make this movie worth it. In my opinion, women who were "wooed" by this movie must not be getting much action in real life. My advice: get out and get a real man or at least go see a real strip show. 

I wish someone would've warned me about this before wasting my money AND my time (that was the longest 2 hours of my life). I'm pretty confident my girlfriend and I (who hated this movie as well) aren't the only ones who felt this way. When we were walking out of the theatre, I didn't see anyone who looked liked they had a good time watching that movie.

(+) Great dancing. Not too much background music to distract. Dialog along with the mistakes (whether intentional or not) made things more authentic.

(-) Not enough dancing scenes! Serious tone of the plot inhibited enjoyment of the club scenes. Needs more male nudity to complement the amount of female nudity.

(=) Magic Mike and The Kid team up and do stripper stuff
