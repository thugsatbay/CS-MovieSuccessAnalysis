### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I saw Me & Earl last week at Sundance and have not stopped thinking about it. That is a long (6 day) shelf life. What more can one ask from a film? The writing and execution is elite quality. All scenes seem necessary. Parent/child relationships, peer relationships, teacher/student relationships all are captured in humorous and touching ways. Life and death realities are also visited through the lens of "kids" who make as much sense as possible when facing the grim possibilities of severe illness.

Sorry to be redundant from other reviews but this darn film has HEART and should be required viewing for anyone who sees at least one movie a year.

Thanks to the team that made this one happen.

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl offers a very accessible, honest, and humorous look at not only how someone deals with being diagnosed with cancer, but it also turns the clichés of the coming-of-age story on its nose, and the people behind this film are able to do that by finding the perfect balance between drama and comedy within this unfortunate tragedy. 

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl centers around Greg (Thomas Mann), a very sarcastic and self-loathing high school student going into his senior year. Greg believes that if he shuts everyone out of his life so that he won't have to deal with anything, then things will be okay, and this gives him a sort of self-gratification. So to uphold his philosophy, he doesn't try to be friends with anyone, but makes sure he's on low-key, good terms with everyone in his school. However, he does spend his time with his co-worker/"friend" Earl (RJ Cyler) making parodies of classic foreign cinema together. However, when Greg learns from his mother that a childhood friend of his, Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is diagnosed with Leukemia, Greg begins a blossoming friendship with Rachel; a friendship that would take him through the best of times, the worst of times, and eventually shape him into the person that he will become. 

While this film definitely shares characteristics with 2014's The Fault in Our Stars (which is a pretty good movie in my opinion), this film to me is more heartfelt and inventive than TFiOS ever was. And most of this has to do with the brilliant screenplay written by Jesse Andrews, who happened to write the book that his film is adapted from. The way that Andrews addresses how to deal with this sickness is wonderfully human and clumsy; whether through comedy, wit, or drama, Andrews finds a way to make the whole scenario relate in some way, shape, or form to anyone and everyone.

The direction and cinematography are absolutely incredible. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, who is known for his work on American Horror Story, and was a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese, shows not only his inventiveness, but his quirkiness as a director on this film. Gomez-Rejon shows his talent with stop motion animation, long panning shots, flashback sequences, and some very long takes that really allow the actors to give the best performances possible. There are even times when this feels like a Wes Anderson film, and this can also be contributed to the gorgeous cinematography. Chung-hoon Chung oozes with style behind the camera, and ultimately the film has a very vibrant look that gave the story being told so much life. These people tell this story with so much care and thought, it's evident that the filmmakers truly respected Andrews' work on the screenplay and wanted to do it the justice it deserves. And thankfully, we got it here.

The performances in this film are all magnetic. Every single one of these actors were able to hold their own on screen. The parents in the film, played by Molly Shannon, Connie Britton, and the always delightful Nick Offerman, all do fantastic work. Their relationships with their children are all very grounded in reality and realistically portrayed. Jon Bernthal is incredibly funny as Greg's history teacher, and is able to depict the "generic cool teacher who understands the main protagonist" in a different, refreshing light. However, the three leads all steal the show. RJ Cyler serves as a foil to Greg's character. Instead of BS-ing people in order to avoid any direct confrontation, Cyler's Earl is very frank with his language and emotions, and gets right to the core of the problem with Rachel. Olivia Cooke gives a very heartfelt and understated performance in this film, and watching her suffering through this sickness that's eating her up is truly heartbreaking to watch. However, the whole film rides on Thomas Mann's shoulders. His detached performance, and the way he handles Rachel's sickness is so realistically somber. His character actually reminds quite a bit of the characters Anthony Michael Hall played in older John Hughes films. He does a fantastic job with the darker comic moments in the film, and the way his character develops throughout the film is nothing short of stellar. 

This film won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival this past January, and it's not hard to see why. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a film filled with heartbreakingly realistic performances, quirky direction, gorgeous cinematography, and spectacular writing. Whether your an art-house fan, a fan of cinema in general, or just the casual moviegoer, there's something in this film that everyone can relate to. It's in wide release right now, so do yourself a favor and go see it, because it's one of the best films of the year.

I have to start my review with discussing the inevitable comparisons with "The Fault in Our Stars". John Green fans would find it blasphemous to say this is a superior film but it certainly is. I don't think that I can argue that the characters in TFIOS are more realistic, but the whole unique style and quirkiness of MAEATDG make it a true classic of the teen genre like "The Breakfast Club" or "Breaking Away". It as important as many of the films to which Earl and Greg pay homage with their own hilarious versions.

So many of the same subjects that one finds in any film about the coming of age of high school students exist in this film, but the director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon puts his own stamp on what could otherwise be called cliché. Kudos to Gomez-Rejon whose previous work has been with several Fox TV shows. He should have a good career in film from here on out.

Olivia Cooke as Rachel, Thomas Mann as Greg, and RJ Cyler as Earl are all fantastic. I was familiar with Olivia Cooke before but not the other two. I expect to see a lot more from all of them.

The adults are all superbly cast as well. Molly Shannon spends the movie with a glass of white wine in one hand drowning the pain of dealing with her daughter's plight. Connie Briton and Nick Offerman are wonderful as Greg's parents, with Nick showing that the eccentricities of the child do not fall far from the tree.

I saw this tonight at a screening in Denver at an art house cinema called "The Mayan" It was built probably in the 30s or 40s most likely a single cinema that they did a pop top on to create two more theaters. Those two upstairs theaters are odd to say the least. The leg room is less than economy class on Spirit Air and the screen is not much more than double the size of my screen at home. Probably less that 150 seats as well.Weird place to show the film, since the theater downstairs is really quite nice. I bring this up because I hope this film gets seen by more than the art- house crowd. It really should have mass appeal. I assume Fox hopes to build strong word of mouth on Me and Earl. Well let me help them. Just go see this film. You won't regret it.

It would be easy to criticize the fact that Me & Earl & the Dying Girl appears to have been genetically engineered to be a summer box office moneymaker (Fox Searchlight and Indian Paintbrush have already snatched up the rights for a record- breaking $12 million). It's an adaptation of a young adult novel about adolescent friendship in the midst of terminal illness, which is hot in Hollywood right now thanks to The Fault in Our Stars. Basically, I went in to this film wanting to despise it for its utter marketability. Upon seeing it, however, I was reminded that movies can be commercially successful and good at the same timeand that's okay. The film chronicles the senior year of Greg (Thomas Mann), his friend Earl (R.J. Cyler), and Rachel (Olivia Cooke), who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Though all of the teen dramedy tropes are presentawkward parents, the teacher who gets it, the exploration of high school cliquesthe excellent supporting cast keeps the narrative fresh. Greg's parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) add an eccentric jolt of parental weirdness to their scenes, and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal takes archetypal cool teacher role into some original territory with his tattoos and battle- scholar vibe. While I found myself wanting more in regards to Rachel's character, the film's treatment of her friendship with Greg is both darkly funny and realistically somber. This is one movie that it's safe to see regardless of its soon-to-be huge commercial appeal. Alex Springer

'ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Critically acclaimed indie comedy-drama flick; about an awkward high school teen, and his young filmmaking buddy, who befriend a sick classmate with leukemia. The film stars Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, Ronald Cyler II, Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon, Katherine C. Hughes and Jon Bernthal. It was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (who's most well known for directing popular TV shows, like 'GLEE' and 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY') and it was written by first time feature film writer Jesse Andrews (and based on his book, of the same name). I absolutely love this movie!

Greg Gaines (Mann) is a senior at Schenley High School, in Pittsburgh, who's made it through school mostly unnoticed, by only slightly communicating (politely) with everyone (in every social group). He makes short film spoofs, with his best friend Earl (Cyler II); who he's known since childhood. One day, Greg's mother (Britton) informs him that another childhood friend, Rachel (Cooke), has been diagnosed with leukemia. He's then forced, by his mom, to spend time with his sick classmate; against both their wishes. A touching friendship forms. 

The film is quirky and hilarious, in places. The actors are all perfectly cast and the characters are all lovable, and memorable. It's also a very touching film, and quite depressing (at times); but it's always beautiful to watch, and wonderfully moving. The cinematography is gorgeous and the score is perfectly fitting. The script is brilliant, and clever as well, and the director is definitely one to watch out for. It's sure to become a cult classic, for many years to come, and who wouldn't love that title?!

There are about four films that can overcome the "seen it" cynicism I have, unlock my heart and make me feel genuine feelings. In other films I can appreciate that the film is beautiful and emotional, but there are only four that can really get to me. The first was Crash, the second was The Green Mile and the third was Boyhood. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl just scored the fourth slot on that extremely small list. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's film is a beautiful cocktail of wonderful things. Its quirky and charming and witty and touching and somber and delicate and completely beautiful. Its got elements of about six of my favourite films of all time, and the fact that it slam dunked Sundance doesn't even surprise me a bit. 

Thomas Mann's Greg is a weirdo. Imagine that Napoleon Dynamite went to Cady Heron's school from Mean Girls, hated all the clicks and became a cynic. Mann shades what could've been a completely unlikeable protagonist with wonderful colours and depth, so much so that when his friend Earl explains to Rachel why Greg is so averse to being friends, we realise we've actually known the whole time. That's probably the most beautiful part of Gomez- Rejon's direction - he never comes out and beats you with information, he leads you gently to it and makes you realise it yourself. RJ Cyler takes Earl, a generic Pedro-type sidekick and makes him just the slacker you'd expect, but with incredible qualities underneath. Olivia Cooke makes the audience love her with her quietly devastating portrayal of a girl with leukaemia. All I can say is that she is a worth recipient of my annual Patricia Arquette Award For Character I Most Want to Hug.

Considering this film has maybe one actor I'd ever heard of, there's a huge pool of talent even in the supporting cast. John Bernthal is good in everything. Nick Offerman is amazing as Greg's stay at home intellectual dad, and Molly Shannon steals every scene as Rachel's emotionally destroyed mother. Keep an eye out for Matt Bennett's utterly bizarre but hilarious Scott Mayhew as well.

Jesse Andrews' screenplay strikes an incredible balance between comedy and drama. Its very easy for a film about cancerous teens to become completely depressing and tedious, but the witty dialogue, incredible spikes of humour and quirky characters make the film beautiful. Andrews isn't trying to make a statement, he's just telling a story about a normal boy who strikes up a friendship with a normal girl. The dialogue is as real as any movie I've ever seen, and the use of minimal effects and hand-held camera really created an authenticity that made me walk away feeling like I've just watched a highly personal reflection, and not a work of fiction.

I saw it three times. Yes,it was painful because we were all that kid -- geek, awkward, nowhere with girls.

The movie is honest, funny, and I will see Olivia Cooke's unreal face in front of me for months. (And she did shave her head; I wondered about that.) R.J. Cyler gave perfect balance to the lead actor's awkward role.

The best thing about this movie is the writing; it crackles at times with insight into the outsider's life.

I am much aggrieved that it only earned four million at the box office nationally. It's worth a lot more.

"We're not even friends." Greg (Mann) is finally a senior. He as survived high school by trying to be invisible to everyone and not causing any drama. When his mother tells him that a classmate (Cooke) has been diagnosed with cancer and that he should hang out with her he hesitates. What starts off as something he is forced to do actually helps him to become who he truly is. If you have teenagers this is a movie they should watch. The movie is a mix of Fault in our Stars and Perks of Being a Wallflower. There is humor and drama in this but the best part about it is that it feels real and nothing about it is forced. The movie could have easily been cheesy and almost after-school-special-like but it stays away from that and becomes something that is truly special. It isn't anything all that original but the writing and acting really make this one of the better movies of this genre and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that could have been very hokey but instead turned out to be very real and heartfelt. A movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love this movie. I give it a high B+.

I have been looking forward to this movie for a while. I saw the trailer and was instantly gripped by it. I got to see it early at the Dallas Film Festival three months before it was actually released. The film was incredible. The dialog was amazing, If you enjoyed fast wit like Juno, then you'll have a blast with this one. It's a must see, and deals with cancer in such a touching way. The acting was amazing. Nick Offerman and Connie Britton were hilarious and touching. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler were also brilliant in every way. The director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, did an amazing job here. Every scene had it's own feel to it that made the film feel unique. 

It captures high school in a great way that I didn't expect. It shows cliques in a new light, and it gives a great representation of how the protagonist deals with it. The film changes tone with ease. With a gradual enough change that doesn't feel forced or awkward. It's an amazing movie.

It's easy to dismiss such a quirky film as Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, the latest independent film to get a release after making quite an impression at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize in the drama category.

Make the film too quirky and you could alienate an audience however, a subtle amount of quirkiness combined with a good blend of comedy and drama will give you a film like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, which ends up being both irresistible and infectious to its audience.

Greg (Thomas Mann) is a high school student who just wants to get through school without associating himself with any of the various cliques or making enemies. Along with his friend Earl (RJ Cyler), Greg spends his spare time making parodies of their favourite classic movies. 

When he learns that his childhood friend, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), has been diagnosed with leukemia, he is forced by his overbearing parents to befriend her in her time of need. Through this friendship, Greg soon finds his outlook on life altered.

There is always the uneasy feeling of laughing at a film that centres around a girl suffering from cancer. There is great care taken though by director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, in making sure that the subject gets the delicate treatment it deserves with the perfect combination of comedy and drama. 

He is aided by a delightful screenplay from Jesse Andrews, the author of the book the film is adapted from, full of enough wit, charm and quirky cutaway moments, such as the feeling of when the hot girl at school talks to you, to leave you with a smile on your face.

The film is elevated to another level by the three main performances from Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke, all showing fine range in both the dramatic and comedic departments. They are supported quite wonderfully by the likes of Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Jon Bernthal and Molly Shannon, and keep your ears peeled for a funny voice cameo from Hugh Jackman that fits the quirkiness of the film so well.

Critics love it and so should audiences, I'm just hoping people decide to go and see it instead of some of the inane drivel that Hollywood produces these days. It really does deserve all the success it can get.

According to the IMDb TOS, they are not currently accepting 2-word reviews -- OH WOW -- so I am going to flesh this out a tiny bit: 

1. Self-aware. The key to all movies about teenage angst. Possibly the key to all the good movies of all time. If you can compel the viewer to look within and produce a shared experience without the accompanying moral outrage, you have nailed it. Ferris Bueller did this. BRICK did this. ME/EARL does this. Instant classic. Oh Wow. (Ooop -- getting repetitive) 

2. Andrews, the writer/adapter, is obviously a film buff. Many film makers have tried to show off their encyclopedic knowledge of film within the confines of their movie -- even the infamous QT, especially the infamous QT -- but nobody was ever this clever. The "trope" of giving the main characters a hobby where they spend their spare time spoofing major films is .. brilliant.

3. Speaking of brilliant, the tiny Claymation sequence off the top where it is scientifically demonstrated how very pretty girls can destroy a passerby without even realizing it ... is not merely brilliant but iconic. That alone guarantees this film will never be forgotten.

4. Cook is a find. She presents as a love child from Jessica Alba (the eyes) and Rachael McAdams (inner glow). A great pedigree.

5. I could go on, but hopefully you get the point. Catch this one NOW, because films this good only come along every 6 or 7 years... if you're lucky

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is based on the novel of the same name by Jesse Andrews, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a one-time assistant to Martin Scorsese. The story is set in Pittsburgh and its protagonist is Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann), a teenager who maintains superficial relationships with most of the cliques in the high school he attends. A good part of the opening scenes involve stuff we've seen before in countless other movies that feature high school kidsthere are the usual geeks, Goths and that one good looking girl on whom the main character has a crush. Greg also has hippies for parents with his sociology professor dad dressing often in a sarong and enamored with exotic cuisine, and a mother who is perennially imbibing a glass of wine which undoubtedly helps her be more sociable.

Greg's African-American friend Earl comes from lower socioeconomic circumstances and the family has virtually "adopted" him since childhood. Greg dubs Earl a "co-worker," unable to call him a friend  they spend a great deal of time concocting parodies of famous films, often using Claymation or stop-action animation (perhaps the neatest aspect of the film). Earl is a weak character as he basically serves the function of being Greg's sidekickhe has little to do throughout the narrative except having a temporary falling out with Greg over the "dying girl" of the title.

The "dying girl" is Greg's fellow student Rachelwhen Greg's mother hears that Rachel has leukemia, she sends her son over to visit her and they quickly become friends. Madison (the good looking student on whom Greg has a crush) convinces him to make one of his quirky movies for Rachel. 

Eventually Greg and Rachel have their own falling out over her decision to stop chemotherapy treatments. Undoubtedly echoing the beliefs of the films' scenarists, Greg self-righteously castigates Rachel for giving up the "treatment" which he believes is the only thing that might save her (why is chemo the only alternative for cancer victims in the movies?). Trusting her own instincts, Rachel decides that the chemo is only making her worse and decides to go off of it. 

Greg finally comes to his senses and I suppose realizes that not accepting Rachel's decision was selfish on his part. So instead of going to the prom with Madison, he brings the movie that he and Earl made for Rachel, and shows it to her on her deathbed. 

Rachel, like Earl, is there to highlight Greg's coming of age story. She's merely the "cancer victim" that helps Greg come out of his shell hardly what you would call a "fleshed out" character. Andrews is content to manipulate our emotions by stating the obviousthe death of a family member or friend from cancer is always a sad story indeed.

Greg's emergence as a more mature, less self-absorbed youth, now headed for college, is the big lesson we're supposed to take from all this. Somehow it's the idea of a dying girl in itself that leads the protagonist to a great epiphany. I say a dying girl is a manipulative trope and inspiration for growth should not come from the cemetery.

First off, this film is NOT like The Fault in Our Stars. It is NOT a Romantic film and it is NOT about dealing with Cancer; this is a friendship movie about a guy who enjoys films who has trained himself to be as distant and as close to everyone becoming more empathetic and focused, while building a connection with Rachel who is dying of cancer. The lack of a love story may be where the film failed in comparison, but it is still nevertheless emotional.

The trio of characters, Greg, Earl and Rachel, all feel like people I'm familiar with. Particularly, I see a lot with Greg, because I am fairly like him and I know people like him, so to see his journey through the film was something that a film like this works well BECAUSE this aspect works well. Earl is the emotional grounding; he centres the film in his and Greg's space, and becomes the voice and reason and social feelings. Rachel is the person who Greg becomes deeply affected with overtime as she goes through Chemotherapy. This film certainly succeeds in making me like the main people. Even when Greg has his meltdown with Rachel not wanting to keep up Chemo, his snapping back never stops making us care for him.

Now, the ending. After this movie, I went to see another film, and I went to buy Popcorn, and the person at the till asked me "what's wrong?" because I was crying. I just signaled the poster off to my right - this movie - and she said "Oh, I know, right?" This ending is truly sad, because in its bittersweetness, you see one story end and another potentially begin. It's the kind of ending that closes everything that we've seen, but opens a potential new one for Greg. The visuals, the voice-over, the music made me sob buckets, and I genuinely can sit through many things without getting emotional. This film is definitely to be considered just for that one aspect of it, so see it, but you WILL cry.

Before I stat, my English teacher suggested me to write every thing that goes into my mind when I want to write something, in order to get over my trouble in expressing my self correctly.

Two days before watching this movie I happen to have watched "The perks of being a wallflower", and I can safely say that both movies are equally amazing in delivering such a wonderful experience to anyone who watches them.Amazingly enough, they both describe punch of situations during the movie that happened/will happen in everyone's high school life, which is magnificent to be quiet frank, but enough talking about two movies at the same time.

Me and Earl and a Dying Girl succeeded in representing one's emotions on the big screen, something that many other movies fails to do, and the reason behind this is simplicity in taking actions, the movie is shot in places that are familiar to any one, the script is close to the modern life, and the whole setting just feels solid.

The experience in the movie made me -no lies here- smile during the whole thing, until the climax (which if you read the book:you will understand what I'm talking about), and while I'm trying hard not to write this whole I'm filled with emotions, I just feel that this movies deserves to be called one of the best experiences out there.

It seems like having three 'amazingly good at acting teenagers' in a movie is the perfect recipe for success, and here it perfectly shown why. I can't stress how amazing it is to see a true relationship between friends in a movie, and how it will draw a bigger smile on the viewers faces.

Ultimately, this is a very underrated movie, and it is a must watch for every one.

Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is an awkward, self-loathing teenager, wandering the halls of his high school with a relaxed and mellow attitude. He's not anti-social, as he goes out of his way to talk to people of all different social groups and cliques, fully intent on never getting too close to call them "friends" and operating just basically enough so he can never become fully immersed in their life or embarrass himself. His friend, though he won't call him that, is Earl (Ronald Cyler II), who has been by his side for years, as the two make low-budget parodies of classic films (IE: "A Sockwork Orange" is their version of "A Clockwork Orange," Jean-Luc Godard's "Breathless" becomes "Breath Less," a film about a man's attachment to his inhaler, and "Midnight Cowboy" becomes "2:48 P.M. Cowboy"). Despite these films blatantly being awful, the two continue their productions for reasons they can't even adequately explain.

One day, Greg's mother makes Greg visit the home of Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke), a girl Greg's age who has just been diagnosed with leukemia, to express his well wishes and give her some company. Right from the get-go, despite being loved and embraced by Rachel's mother (Molly Shannon), who is constantly sipping alcohol following her divorce and her daughter's diagnosis, Rachel detects the obligation of Greg's visit. Nonetheless, the two make casual small talk, with Rachel revealing her normal side and Greg continuing to harp on his awkward, self-hating side with little tact and emotion. He remains in a constant state of mellow carelessness at all times, but grows close to Rachel, even going the distance to working with Earl to make a movie for her when she begins chemotherapy and becomes increasingly withdrawn.

"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" immediately feels like a Wes Anderson picture that tackles realm of quirky teenage films so heavily that it becomes twee and almost petty. The opening sequence alone reminded me how tired I was of hearing stories that begin with "this is not your typical high school love story" or the continued affirmation of the main character's unique story by saying "this is the part where her and I should kiss" or "this is not your typical romance." This has gone from being subversive and innovative to a cloying attempt to be original and unique, incessantly reminding the audience that your story is different.

Yet, "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" is special because, much like Rick Famuyiwa's "Dope," released last week, it reminds how people are much more complex than films often portray. "Dope" focused on the perils of living in South Central Los Angeles and getting caught up in gang activity all while struggling to remain true to yourself, find yourself, and stay in tune with your morals. With that, "Dope" showed how a person is not easily defined and there were many shades of gray in defining a human and his choices.

This film operates on the same plane. Scenes with Greg and Rachel do not go the way we expect at all. At no moment does Greg comfort Rachel by holding her, caressing her, kissing her, or giving her the reactionary statement that "everything's gonna be all right." At no point does he really ever give her a reason to smile because he is being flattering or particularly kind to her. Quite frequently, I found myself being really surprised at his behavior; it's unlike most behavior we see between two adolescents in film, but yet, not uncommon of adolescents in the real world.

Films have shaped our ideas about teenagers in a way that paints many of them as stereotypes or members of an easily defined class. Films like this, "Kids," and "The Breakfast Club" have worked to paint richer, more realistic pictures, showing the grayness in defining adolescents and showing that the emotions they feel, the decisions they make, and the paths they work to forge for themselves can be just as daunting as the priorities many adults face each and every day. If nothing else, "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" reminds, if not, informs, that teens aren't easily defined caricatures - some sit before computers and edit their own makeshift films with their friend with posters of Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets" and François Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" neatly hung on the walls behind them.

"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" also mixes the brutally honest, complex emotions of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" with the basic premise (but not mawkish sentimentality and ultimate corniness) of "The Fault in Our Stars." Mann proves to be an interesting character, almost an anti-hero in his ability to love or be loved because of his own stubborn attitude and coldness to the idea of personal connection. Kushner also gives a tremendously affecting performance on a low-key level, with emotional scenes that hit right on the noise. They're not too overdrawn and they're not too cutely resolved or painted; they're brutally, unequivocally real.

The only thing burdening the film is its obsession with its own quirkiness and its increasingly irritating ability to try and remain meta and different. The film's insistence on its own desire to be unique unintentionally undermines Jesse Andrews' compelling, heartwrenching story and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's (who also directed the strong remake of "The Town That Dreaded Sundown") directing, which resembles the astute, symmetrical-precision of Wes Anderson. "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl," however, ultimately succeeds in showing humans, particularly adolescents, as they naturally are - complex, sometimes detached, but never boring.

What a huge disappointment. The tremendously positive response it received at Sundance made me think this should have been something I would really like. I also like Olivia Cooke from her role in the TV series "Bates Motel." But I should have seen the negative signs: the film received good, but not great critical reviews, and the film had no legs, topping out at $6 million at the box office.

The movie is pretentious, self-referential, self-indulgent, and tries to be oh-so-clever. Thomas Mann in the male lead of Greg is awful. It reminded me a little bit of Juno, with high school kids spouting things and doing things that high school kids just don't do.

I know this movie has been compared to "The Fault in Our Stars," due to the common theme. I wasn't a big fan of "The Fault in our Stars"...I thought it was just OK. But compared to "Me, Earl and the Dying Girl," "The Fault in Our Stars" is "Citizen Kane."

The good: - Some unconventional and interesting cinematography made by Chung- hoon Chung with some departures from his usual style (I recognize in it a mixture of Wes Anderson and a bunch of other pretty known directors). Sometimes framing and camera movements are a bit an end in themselves but whatever. - Nice performances by some actors - Well... that's all.

The bad: - Most of gags and jokes are just meh. - Some of the gags and jokes are not just meh: they're so bad it's embarrassing to watch. - In fact, I think about a joke out of 10 in the movie is actually decent. - A bit juvenile, and this is meant in the worst possible way - The plot is so predictable it's painful. Yes, it will develop and it will end just like you expect it to do after 10 minutes of watching. - In the economy of the movie, Earl could've never existed and it would've been exactly the same. A useless, insignificant character who for some reason is in the title. - At the 30 minutes mark the movie already began to bore me, and it bored me from that point till the end. - The delivery of any emotional content fails miserably. Everything is so fake, shallow, badly written, badly directed. It's not actors' fault. This, with the exception of something towards the end, where they got it easy...

Inconceivably overrated piece of sh*t of a movie that saves itself from total failure only thanks to some good cinematography. It is actually one of the worst movies I've watched in 2015, and believe me, I watched plenty. 4/10.

This movie sucks! tries to hard to be an special movie or something artistic, the result is a COMPLETE FAIL, Two words: "boring" and "shallow" like a lot of movies of this last couple of years. Maybe is because of the influence of that trend called hipster, IDK, I miss movies like Good Will Hunting, As Good as It Gets, etc. I am talking about drama movies that delivers a lot of emotions. In this movie you can hardly remember a great line or scene that stays in your head. Well I hope that this kind of trend end soon and we began to see some quality movies. Don't get me wrong I don't think that everything is bad nowdays, for example in my opinion the movie "The Way Way Back", was a pretty decent movie and I think that is in the same tone of this "indie" "modern/retro" kind of movie, but WAY WAY BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE "Me and Earl..."

I really wanted to like this movie but I felt absolutely nothing watching it; the film never seemed genuine to me.

The title is very misleading. Earl is hardly seen in the film, and the friendship between the two boys wasn't plausible or believable. Earl was not portrayed in a very sympathetic manner and seemed to me to be a cold, distant, unlikeable character. There was no chemistry between Greg and Rachel, and the film began to take on a morbid, hopeless feeling as it progressed. I have to agree with another reviewer here that the picture seemed more interested in being cute (the short films the two boys made, the self-deprecating humor from Greg) than developing any real characters or relationships between them all. I enjoyed "The Fault in Our Stars," and this reminded me of an attempt to cash in on the same audience, but it didn't have anywhere near the heart that the former film did. It would have been much more meaningful if Greg and Rachel had voiced some acknowledgement at the end that they had meant something to each other. Instead, the film tries so desperately not to be sentimental that it comes across as very distant and emotionless. The film had a very promising beginning, but went way downhill as it progressed.

The sequence and the double use of "and" in the title foreshadows more than just the plot, it also give you a sense of the third-wheel-ness of the titular female character. Olivia Cooke spends most of the film failing to thrive while Mann and Cyler play out the pathos and give author Jesse Andrews a chance to revel in his love of cinema. The movie parodies produced by Greg and Earl are less approachable nostalgic references for a wider audience than film geek inside baseball for a more specific crowd. Between the long spates of movie lore, Greg's monologue-ing about the densely layered high school class structure and The Dying Girl's swooning, the movie is fairly dull. In short, much of the critical praise comes from movie geeks complimenting a movie geek movie and from a twist ending that gives a French film melancholia to the processings.

This film is truly amazing. I love every single piece of it. The characters are so all different but they complete each other in an extraordinary way. I also love how they fool the audience to believe that Rachel will survive. I really, really believed it. I was like, no they won't kill her, they can't. They have made me like her too much that it just would be cruel to kill her. But then she just died and was sitting there drowning in my own tears and parts of me was still believing that she would jump out of no where and just "it was just a joke everybody, i'm alive". But it didn't happen unfortunately. 

I would also like to add that the aesthetic way the made the movie is great. The colors make it pleasant to look at and the different angels they are filming it makes the movie even more lovable. 

This movie gets a straight 10 out of 10! One of the best movies Iv'e ever seen!

It's VERY good; a bit much on the extreme close ups (Greg, the lead, is extremely self- absorbed) but a quirky look at his life and how he's forced to visit a classmate with leukemia. My one problem with The Fault in Our Stars was the leads looked too healthy; Olivia Cooke as Rachel really looked quite ill in parts of the movie. The movies that Greg and his friend Earl make were a hoot. Some wonderful stop-motion animation in this movie, particularly in the little movie Earl and Greg make for Rachel. Also enjoyed the way that most of the adults were every bit as weird as the kids, particularly Greg's father and the history teacher.

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of those rare teenage movies that actually depicts teenagers. I never said it does it all that well, but at least it gives it an honest effort. It often feels true to the spirit of youth in that the film is slow, uncertain, ordinary, and slightly crude. The main characters aren't supermodels (although they ain't ugly), and they carry themselves in an exaggerated, basic form of what a teenager truly is. It is a refreshing and hopeful move away from the action-packed and otherwise soulless frameworks of modern teenage films, all the way from ridiculous vampires to ridiculous dystopias.

Despite this impressive regression to reality, it isn't perfect, coming off more as a stepping stone to a (perhaps exclusively teenage) cinematic era of real people doing real things. The teenagers are way too intelligent, always ready with a witty remark to shatter conversation barriers that most teenagers would find almost insurmountable. Everyone has a powerfully distinguishing feature, whether they're gorgeous, creative, or just plain weird. It's as if a thirty-year old man clinging onto the vestiges of his youth decided to write a book about a segment of his life that he barely remembers. And it is.

But all this is simply a minor problem. The script's bumps are more than made up for by the wonderful acting. This film was one of the few where I could actually appreciate the acting as more than a vehicle for the plot. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke and RJ Cyler have brilliant chemistry as the main characters of this film. Their dynamic is always brilliantly up-and-down, ranging from friendly conversation to boiling rage. It is always nice to see young actors who can actually act.

And now for the plot. This is where the beauty of the film resides, and also its major, unavoidable drawback. First, its beauty. Greg, a self-loathing teenager with a fear of commitment (typical teenager, either they hate or love themselves) spends his days making parodies of classic films with his buddy Earl (who he prefers to call his "coworker"). His life seems aimless and disconnected from the real world, as if he is wrapped up in himself so tightly that he refuses to let reality penetrate his own defenses. After his mother's incessant urging, he is forced into a "doomed friendship" with Rachel, another teenage girl who just happens to have a terminal illness (hence the "dying girl" of the title). Through this girl, whom he immediately establishes a connection with, he overcomes his own fear of connection, and eventually becomes attuned to his own creative spirit, which he reveals to us in the beautiful, heartbreaking climax of the film.

But when I thought about it, I realized that I had a problem with all this. This movie relied on character development (and to a lesser extent cinematography and acting). The main character developed. But at what cost? The death of a young girl. Do filmmakers have the right to kill someone who has barely lived in pursuit of a theme that could be achieved using much more subtle methods? Must we face the death of someone we love in order to change? This common theme (perhaps even a celebration) of death in teenage films is disturbing.

So like I said, it gives it an effort, and that effort is much appreciated. But the exploitation of death is a bit more than I am able to admire.

'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is another screen adaptation of a Young Adult novel of the same name written by Jesse Andrews who also serves as the screenplay writer for the film. The story progresses from the protagonist Greg's perspective who is pretty much in every scene of the film. He is an awkward boy in high school. He clearly feels like an outsider in the high school environment and has no identity. He has no friends and his self-esteem is also very low. But he has a companion named Earl whom he calls his 'co-worker'. Both being huge cinephiles, they spend their time making low-budget, comedic remakes of classic art-house films. But then Greg's mother makes him spend some time with Rachel, a schoolmate who has been diagnosed with leukemia, so that Greg could give her company and cheer her up a little. His interaction with Rachel makes Greg understand and realise a lost of things about life, death and his own self.

Let me first mention the things that I liked. First of all I really liked Olivia Cooke as Rachel, the titular dying girl with cancer. She gives an understated performance and I found her sweet and adorable. The friendship between Greg and Earl is likable. They don't hug a lot, but their friendship still comes off as believable. The direction during the initial half of the film remains likable. The film constantly references classic films, and as a hardcore cinephile, I found that pleasantly satisfying. There are admirable uses of the camera. The director uses both tracking shots as well as static long shots from time to time skilfully. There is one particular scene in the film which is filmed in a single long shot with static camera that really impressed me. The acting from Olivia Cooke and Thomas Mann in that scene was impressive.

One of the biggest complaints that I have against the films based on Young Adult novels is that I think they try really, extremely hard to make the viewer cry. You will see the director along with the screenplay writer pull out all the clichés in the book and crank the sentimentality up to 11. But these tactics invariably make me cringe instead of cry. I treat a filmmaker's ability to make me cry with the utmost sanctity. But that happens when a director can make you feel the emotions and overwhelm you, instead of throwing sentiment and clichés at your face. Unfortunately Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another film that takes the desperate route to make the viewer cry and from a personal standpoint fails. The issues that Greg struggles with also felt a bit tacky and uninteresting. I am not one of those individuals who complains about people struggling with first world problems in films. Just because you're financially stable doesn't mean you can't have problems in your life. But the self esteem issues in the film felt very trivial. I know the characters that appear other than the 3 titular characters are introduced through the perspective of Greg, so they need not be very realistic. But all of them are nothing but caricatures and the director couldn't even remotely humanise them. Talented actors like Connie Britton and Nick Offerman have next to nothing to offer. 

As a whole the film has elements that work, but in an overall sense, it failed to win me over. I didn't hate it. But I wouldn't jump at the prospect of watching it again either.

This film tells the story of a socially awkward teenager, who is forced by his mother to befriend a girl with cancer.

"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" seems to be loved by viewers, but I don't understand how come there is so much love for this film. For a start, Greg, Earl and not even the girl with cancer are sympathetic or likable. They do their best to not care and not connect with each other. The plot is neither captivating not touching, and to be honest I was thoroughly bored by the plain non happening in the film. The only entertaining bit in the film is the art pieces carved out from books, but these scenes only last for a few seconds, and are not enough to save me from boredom and apathy.
