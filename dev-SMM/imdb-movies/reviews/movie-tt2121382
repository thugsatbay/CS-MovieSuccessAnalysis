### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
In a moment of weakness, a middle-aged father of two tries to save himself rather than his family in a dangerous situation, an action that has deep ramifications for their relationship. Winner of the Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard competition in Cannes in 2014 and Sweden's official entry into the Oscar sweepstakes for Best Foreign Film, Ruben Ostlund's Force Majeure (original title Turist), his fourth feature and his first since Play (2011), is a biting satire that has sharp teeth. Filmed at an actual resort, Les Arcs, in France, a seemingly happy and well-adjusted family that includes Tomas (Johannes Bah Kuhnke), Ebba (Lisa Loven Kongsli), and their young children Harry (Vincent Wettergren) and Vera (Clara Wettergren), go on vacation at an expensive ski resort in the French Alps.

Ebba tells a friend that their purpose is to bring the family closer together since Tomas has been very busy at work. All seems well as they spend the first day hitting the slopes and taking pictures, but the idealized picture-postcard scene begins to unravel on the second day. Taking a break from skiing, the family has lunch at an outdoor restaurant with gorgeous mountain scenery in the background. When they suddenly witness a controlled avalanche, the force of the blowing snow seems to threaten everyone in the café. Instinctively, Ebba reaches out to protect her children, but Tomas, in a moment of panic, grabs his cell phone and runs for cover. His spur of the moment decision sends a message to the Ebba and the children, that in times of emergency, they could be abandoned.

No matter how it is rationalized away, the element of trust that cemented their relationship is broken beyond repair. To compound the problem, both seek to maintain control by suppressing and denying their feelings until they are no longer able to. In front of a couple of Norwegian friends, the divorced Mats (Kristofer Hivju), and his 20-year-old girlfriend, Fanni (Fanni Metelius), who come for a visit and are drawn into the argument, Tomas resorts to rationalization and denial. Absurdly, when they look at footage of the event captured by his cell phone, all Tomas can say is "I agree it looks like I'm running." Ebba's neat little world is also threatened by a friend telling her that she and her husband maintain an open relationship, even after having two children and it all works fine.

Unwilling or unable to acknowledge his action, Tomas beats himself up with guilt and engages in a prolonged crying jag which Ostlund characterizes as the moment when, "crying stops to be poetic and starts to be something that is just miserable deeper and deeper  but doesn't create any sympathy, or empathy." Though wryly observant rather than intimate and may go on a bit too long, Force Majeure is smartly written, beautifully photographed, and darkly comic. Willing to confront deeply-rooted gender stereotypes and challenge us to look at our own life and see how we might have acted in a similar situation, it is a force of nature, both literally and figuratively.

I consider myself fortunate not to have known much about the movie. Actually, I was expecting a french disaster-flick in the vein of "127 Hours", a post-avalanche survival tale, because of the promotional poster.

Boy, I was wrong. Being misguided often gets me irritated, but "Force Majeure" was shockingly impressive.

The narrative follows a Swedish couple on a ski-holiday with their children, and the aftermath of them facing a somewhat life- threatening situation. The disaster here is not a force of nature, but a force of human emotions.

With no intention of spoiling a movie you should know as little as possible about, this is a hard hitting emotional drama about human frailty, marriage, inner torment and moral dilemmas when it comes to love, and the authenticity of love.

Very much recommended to lovers of layered, intelligent drama. And I repeat, this is not a natural disaster movie.

Greetings again from the darkness. No one has sung the words "I'm a MAN" better than the great Muddy Waters, but even he would have been unable to bounce back from the ramifications of the split-second reaction of Tomas when things go awry at lunch.

Writer/director Ruben Ostland delivers an intriguing and thought-provoking look at gender roles and the definition and expectations of masculinity, especially within a family. What makes a real man? What is a hero? Is our predilection of survivalist or protector hard-wired into our DNA? And what happens to a relationship when the foundation of respect crumbles? Would you believe this film tackles these emotional issues, and does so in such a brilliant manner, that we often find ourselves chuckling (albeit with a tinge of guilt)?

A family vacation in the French Alps takes a turn when, while lunching on a veranda overlooking the ski slopes, a controlled avalanche goes wrong and the café is threatened. Tomas (Johannes Bah Kuhnke) grabs his phone and goes scurrying for protection, while his wife Ebba (Lisa Loven Kongsli) covers the kids and calls for his help. Both are instinctive reactions, and while one recalls George in a "Seinfeld" episode, the other is more in line with what we expect from a parent.

While the avalanche turns out harmless and the family members are physically fine, the emotional shockwaves of Tomas' actions reverberate through the family ... and even through another couple (Kristofer Hivju, Fanni Metelius). There is a exceptional dinner scene with the two couples which brings the issue to a head, and it's excruciatingly painful and funny to witness. It's terrific story telling and filmmaking and acting.

This is Sweden's submission for Best Foreign Language Oscar, and it must be considered a favorite so far. Though I'm not a huge fan of the final 15 minutes, that doesn't take away from the questions as the characters try to come to grips with the situation. Really nice contrasts between dark humor, disappointment and broken trust.

Force majeure means "superior force" in French but is also known as cas fortuit or casus fortuitus in Latin, which translates as "chance occurrence, unavoidable accident." Indeed, Ruben Östlund's new Swedish drama features an inciting incident in the form of an avalanche, which greatly disturbs the relationship between husband and wife Tomas and Ebba, who are visiting a ski resort in the French Alps with their two young children.

While the family is eating lunch on a sun deck at a restaurant, Tomas assumes that what's coming toward them is a 'controlled avalanche', but when the blizzard envelopes the diners, he's the first to flee, leaving his wife and children to fend for themselves. As it turns out, the snow only reaches the resort in the form of a mist, and a couple of minutes later, everything is back to normal.

Ebba is furious at Tomas for what she perceives as his cowardice, leaving his children unprotected in a great time of crisis. She isn't afraid to embarrass Tomas by describing the incident to a couple whom they've just met at the resort. Tomas, however, denies that he ran and insists it's simply a matter of different perceptions of what occurred.

Tomas' denial infuriates Ebba even more and she again brings up the subject in front of Mats, an old friend who's also there at the resort, along with his much younger girlfriend, Fanni. Mats attempts to defend Tomas by stating that in times of crisis, one doesn't necessarily act rationally while in 'panic mode'. But when Ebba points out that Tomas filmed the incident with his cell phone, she insists that the offending incident on video be played. Sure enough, there is incontrovertible evidence that Tomas indeed fled the scene and can no longer refute his wife's claims.

As a result, Tomas withdraws into a great depression. While on the slope, Mats encourages him to let his feelings out with his voice, noting that he's pent up with rage. Tomas' 'venting' on the slope is reminiscent of the 'Primal Scream' therapy of the 60s. This leads him to break down in front of his family back at the room at the hotel and he's able to sob uncontrollably. Notably, Ebba is embarrassed by the expression of all those pent-up emotions in contrast to the children, who hug their father while he's going through this catharsis.

Tomas is a new manor is he? One wonders why he takes the family up on the ski slope in dangerous blinding blizzard conditions. Perhaps he wants to prove to himself that he can protect them in the event of an emergencyand indeed, when Ebba loses her way on the slope, Tomas rescues her. The thought occurred to me that Ebba lost her way on purpose in order to create the opportunity for Tomas to save her. Whatever the case, we can now conclude that the crisis in regards to Tomas' masculinity is over and he has restored equilibrium in that regard. 

The Force Majeure denouement adds an ambiguous coda to the previous proceedings. After leaving the resort, an erratic bus driver leads Ebba to fear for her life and now she's the one who's in full panic mode, leaving the bus without her children. It's another 'chance occurrence' where the normally controlled (and controlling) Ebba, finds herself quite out of control. Has she gotten her comeuppance or was she justified in panicking, in the face of that seemingly crazed driver? We note that one of the women that Ebba had met and talked to back at the resort, remains on the bus with the driver. Earlier, she had made it clear that she enjoyed taking chances, especially in regards to the idea of an open marriage, in striking contrast to Ebba, who couldn't countenance such actions, outside the more staid bourgeoisie union, which she had cultivated for so long with husband Tomas. 

What can we conclude from Ebba's actions? Some internet posters have suggested that she is now intent on abandoning her family. As they walk down the road, she asks Mats to hold her daughter. Did she 'overreact' about the bus driver, since the woman who approved of open marriage, didn't feel at all in danger and remained on the bus? Quite possibly. An earlier scene, in which Ebba abandons the family on the ski slope, would also suggest that she's ready to call it quits with Tomas. As for the intrepid husband, when he admits that he smokes to the boy while walking down the road, it's clear that he no longer puts on any pretenses as to who he is.

'Force Majeure' falls under the appellation of the 'interesting' film. There's much food for thought here as one attempts to decipher the film's underlying meaning. The film's weakness is the lack of judicious editing, causing it to often move along at a glacial pace. I could have done without some of the long-winded visuals as their presence was detrimental to the narrative's overall fluidity.

The Europeans do this kind of film so well. You let ordinary people in a fairly common situation play out a theme. It poses questions that all of us can relate to and therefore and at the same time, entertains. No need for explosions, cartoon violence, or impossible crisis after impossible crisis. Therefore the emotions revealed are subtle and appropriate. (Think Manon de Sources for example - although this is not as good)! Some of the camera work in the mountains is so straightforward yet produces breathtaking results. Artificial avalanches are created to preempt natural ones and provide safety for the snow lovers. You could almost be there. The actors are relatively unknown so there is no baggage, no false expectations, no subliminal 'hierarchy of the characters.' It's what gives the story its power. I saw this at a film festival which shuns Hollywood's attempts at drama ( thankfully) to bring nuggets like this. I know it went down well at Cannes and its failure to get an award surprised some.

SPOILERS OF PLOT THROUGHOUT

From other reviews you can get the key elements of the story - family in 'danger', father runs instead of making sure they are safe, wife spends most of the rest of film judging him as unworthy etc. etc.

Far too much of this film is unnecessary - long wasted shots, bodily functions - look - they brush their teeth and go to the loo just like real, normal people - and the film seems fine with obsessing over what Tomas did while almost completely ignoring what Ebba and Fanni do.

As has been covered by others - Ebba's reaction is to see him as a non- man. She reached for the kids, he ran, therefore he is not worthy so she shuts down - no contact, no discussion, everything changes to the point the kids are convinced they'll get a divorce. Then Tomas has his crying/wailing breakdown, the kids comfort him and then Ebba eventually joins the family hug of daddy. Fine, whatever.

Another annoying part was Fanni's 'hypothetical' attack on her partner after hearing Ebba's story - she gets to say horrible things to him 'hypothetically' and then he has to shut up just because she wants to sleep. It goes on, and on, as he can't sleep while trying to justify himself against something that hasn't happened - ie her claim that he wouldn't rescue her and that he has failed to do everything for his family because he's divorced.

But then - the scene with the family together ski-ing in dangerous conditions and she fakes an injury for him to 'rescue' her leaving the kids standing in the cold and her walking back to get her skis is ridiculous.

After that - the bus scene with the idiot driving nearly putting the bus through the wall and over the edge. Yes, she is right to complain and get off the bus ... but she rushes off the bus herself. Leaves her kids and husband behind. And the response to this? Nothing. An overlong shot of the group walking down the hill after she has done exactly what she spent most of the film whining about her husband doing. We've just had 2 hours of her expressing her feelings about what happened with the controlled avalanche - but Tomas just has to accept her actions? Fine, whatever.

Force Majeure is a paused and systematic character study principally integrated by bitter conversations, uncomfortable moments and the inclement dissection of a marriage in trouble, analyzing the sudden change a casual event (in this case, an avalanche) can provoke on something which seemed so strong and safe. The result is moderately interesting... and occasionally boring. There undoubtedly are provocative ideas in this film; but there's also some frustration due to its excessively slow rhythm and the obstinacy from some characters. Director and screenwriter Ruben Östlund must have been too proud of his work, so therefore, he didn't want to leave even one minute out of the long two hours this film lasts. On the positive side, the performances are excellent and the alpine settings are truly impressive (pity that we spend so much time inside the hotel). Force Majeure examines multiple aspects of a couple: as a husband and wife, as parents, and as compatible adults, even though they don't lack of some fundamental differences which might indicate a big separation in their personal ideology. As I said on the beginning of this commentary: moderately interesting content, but presented in a way which occasionally challenges the patience and attention from the audience. Force Majeure didn't leave me very satisfied, but I don't regret having watched it, and I think I can give it a slight recommendation.

 An avalanche comes dreadfully close to burying a family on vacation in the Alps. The shock of this freak occurrence does not end here. Fear continues to cascade through individual psyches and false facades. While mingling and mixing with fellow travelers, questions arise regarding how much each family member cares for the others. Judgments are as cold and indifferent as ice and snow, and potentially more damaging. Winner of one of the oddly named and puzzlingly layered jury prizes at Cannes, Force Majeure delves into the disconnection and dissonance that happens when personal occupations, habits, anxieties and phones take the place of communication and empathy within a family. The near tragedy and the time and occasion to dwell on it, call into question what it means to be a woman and man. For all the buzz surrounding this film I expected a little more from the actors, yet they are capable enough. The profound impact and depth of the story, masterful transitioning and clever use of silence, sound and winter imagery, more than make up for this minor offense. This is a complex and striking film in a deceptively simple package.

In the tradition of movies like 2011's "The Loneliest Planet", the inciting incident of Sweden's failed entry into this year's awards season is sure to spur uncomfortable conversations with those dumb enough to watch this with a spouse or loved one.

"Force Majeure", a title which literally translates to superior force or unavoidable accident, follows a picturesque family (father, mother, son and daughter) on a ski vacation at a picturesque ski resort. They seem to be having the perfect time.

During a dinner, they find themselves witness to a controlled avalanche which comes a little too close for comfort. But when this happens a split second decision is made; a decision which clearly bothers the wife more than her husband, as (through conversation) she is forced (and forces herself) to relive the event over and over again; a decision that will slowly begin to snowball in the days that follow, causing this happy family to question everything which up to that point had bonded them together.

While this premise sounds like the makings of a fascinating social experiment (and it is, for a time) the issue with "Force Majeure" lies in its overlong runtime. The fateful event happens in the first 15 minutes and the effects of this event begin immediately after that. Yet this is a 2 hours plus movie. And thus, at around the one hour mark I remembered thinking to myself, "OK, I got it. This is an interesting experiment, but wrap it up already." The direction from Ruben Ostlund is definitely a high point, as was the cinematography, both which really capture the beauty as well as the tremendous force of this films natural backdrop. And yes, there are a few interesting moments in the latter half of this movie, but even these become repetitious. And as it all leads up to an obnoxiously ambiguous ending anyway, with seemingly nothing to say about events which proceeded it, it's safe to say that "Force Majeure" would have made a better short.

Final Thought: Despite what most critics were predicting, "Force Majeure" did not receive a 2015 Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. And, in this reviewer's opinion, did not deserve one. So with that said, this late lukewarm review will undoubtedly mean nothing and furthermore is one nobody will likely read anyway.

The only thing that made me laugh in this was that the film ends with a scene so reminiscent of Bunuel's "Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise " ... A family of modern high earners go on a skiing holiday and have a brush with nature ... True human nature shows itself ... And they temporarily fall apart but pull themselves together to continue their petty bourgeoise existence back home ... Providing they can walk along a road till someone picks them up or gets them some other transport It is not funny ... I laughed once and I can't remember at what ... This is getting so much ridiculous praise its amazing ... But I can guarantee it will have disappeared in 2 years ...

If you like to watch people brushing their teeth, you've got about 5 minutes of action in store. Bonus: the electric toothbrushes sound like leaf-blowers! Same goes for artsy shots of trees, or empty ski-lift chairs moseying across the screen. Or showing people walking/climbing long distances in real time. Seriously, a full hour could have been cut from this movie with these dead shots. And it still would have been bad. 

This movie was slow ... boring ... pointless ... dull. The only laugh/human reaction I had during this tedious two hours was when my husband asked, "Is this a Wes Anderson movie?"

No, we do not like Wes Anderson movies. But we love foreign films. Except for this one.

As for plot, it apparently was an examination of two people's reactions to one event. But of course there's loads of underlying baggage; it just takes forever for it to unload. In the end, it's like every other family vacation -- mom and dad fight, kids cry, the end. Back to the daily grind.

There are films that are not to someone's taste, which does not condemn the film on its own terms. I don't like most movies for this reason, as it's number of car crashes that define success too often. But this one was meant to be meaningful, and exploration of marriage, relationships, the role of a man in a changing society. I do get enormous pleasure out of odd films that are not designed for a mass audience as this one attempts to be, but fails in an especially arrogant way. 

I am really more disturbed by the wide approval of those who mistake "art" for lack of comprehensive meaning, accepting that this must have been important when it was just incompetent film making. The film had a number of elements that added nothing but blind alleys, as if they were shot, didn't fit the evolving plot, and were just left in the final cut. 

The following had no meaning at all: 

There was a long scene by what looked like a video game, but was a toy drone that came into the families window.

There was a working man who appeared in several places, once looking at the couple from a hallway and reluctant to leave- but with this setup there was no character developed, and he was just man who was being set up for something in the structure of the film that I guess did not make it to the final print.

There was the husband and his friend at a bar with an aborted pickup by two women - no context, no development of character 

The film could have been meaningful if the breakdown of the Husband, acknowledging his self loathing had been the ending, with the extraneous items above simply left on the cutting room floor. There was one late scene in a fog bound isolated high point of the mountain, where the wife chose to feign injury so her husband could come to save her. The setting was absurd, as the conditions could have been lethal, but once more, no concern for verisimilitude. 

But, in the aggregate the elements above and the absurd ending with the wife demanding that a bizarre incompetent driver taking them all home down a mountain road stop so she, later everyone, could walk the road made no sense at all. There are so many sleeper films from small countries that capture truth, and are willing to forgo cinematic devices to gain a wider audience. 

This one pretended to be of this genre- but failed.

As this movie is Swedish, as I am myself, I would have liked to give it good marks. But this is not possible. This was a very slow, stupid and silly movie. Nothing really happens, you have to look at for instance people walking on a mountain road for several minutes. It is low-budget and amateurish. The only value I can see in it is some nature scenery (very sparse of this though despite of the location), and that you can relate to the things the characters do if you have yourself been to a skiing resort with your kids.

The plot in short: a Swedish/Norwegian family of four goes to a ski resort in the Alps. An incident happens that might be dangerous - but turns out not to be. The father gets into a panic and thinks only of saving himself. Then follows a lot of quasi-psychological stuff. In the end another incident happens that might be dangerous - but turns out not to be. This time the mother panics and thinks only of saving herself. This is supposed to be a happy ending, with everything evened out..?!! I can only say: poor kids with BOTH parents like that!!!

This was a pretty bad movie, its saving grace being we decided not to watch it in the cinema but instead waited to stream it. That way we were openly able to discuss its convoluted plot devices and lack of any drama, interest, intelligence or comedy.

None of the characters were likable. Not even in an interesting way. Just irritating, badly formed and thrown and into ridiculous situations that lacked any credibility.

Poor film. Sold as an intelligent comedic journey but is as blank and plain as the many whiteouts throughout the film.

However, it's worth getting the name of the ski resort. They must be the emptiest slopes in Europe.

I saw Turist this afternoon. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And by far the most irritating one! The first 45 minutes almost nothing happens. The movie is very slow, bad and irritating dialogs, bad acting, bad drama, very thin story (which in itself doesn't have to be bad). I don't know if this was an attempt to make some sort of intellectual movie, but if it was, it totally failed for me. I left after 1 hour and 55 minutes, couldn't take it anymore. Didn't see the end thus. SPOILER: The off piste skiing suggested that finally something was going to happen. This suggestion was the best part of the movie.

I have to say that at the end of the movie, I ended is a mild state of shock that lasted at least 20 minutes before I could start to assimilate the content of the movie. Visually the movie is well executed, the sceneries are not complex but the shots fit perfectly the situations that happen along the movie.

About the movie as a whole, I could say that you could easily write a book about it, is so full of different things like human emotions, psychological collapses, marriage problems, bizarre situations, funny scenes that could produce so many different reactions on people, the nature of the female and male towards protecting others... I could go on and on and on. I think that at the end of the movie the viewers will have a lot to talk about.

If you are a passionate and curious person and you take the decision to see this movie, be patient and enjoy it from the beginning to the end without interruptions.

This film feels more like a play than a movie. The characters are incredibly flat and one-note and exist only to bounce off each other and enable each other's personality defects. The minor characters like the wife's polyamorous acquaintance and the ginger guy and girlfriend are just boring instantiations of the various philosophies that the director wants to play with in this movie, with no great success.

I didn't find the two main characters compelling and as a result was bored with their dynamic which occupies 95% of the conflict. Also, the ending is very vague - not just ambiguous, which I'm fine with, but vague and unsatisfying.

Also, the film is far too long for what it contains and filled with repetitive, useless shots of people brushing their teeth and urinating, among other things. (Seriously, what was the point of the shot of the son in the restroom at the beginning? It made me feel like a perv.) And of course it wouldn't be a European film without gratuitous female nudity. 

Hard to believe it has been so well-reviewed. This movie contains almost nothing of substance or value because it has been done before in better ways. The only saving grace is that it is nice to watch because it is very attractively shot.

FORCE MAJEURE is a short film that somehow ended up a feature. The idea is good: a Swedish family go on an Alpine skiing holiday and one day, at lunch, they look like they are about to be hit by an avalanche. At the moment of crisis the father of the family flees, abandoning his wife and children. The avalanche stops, the family are safe, and the questions begin. Soon various friends and the kids are drawn in, as the family begins to disintegrate. The problem is that there just isn't enough meat on this bone; the conversations are forced, repetitive and lack depth. Worse still, it's hard to care about these people; it has that peculiarly Scandi coldness, where there are no close-ups, where the characters are eternally uptight, and where the closest we get to humanity is to watch the actors urinating or brushing their teeth. To bulk this out there are lots of lovely shots of the ski slopes. Like many Scandi films there is a slightly hysterical bleakness to all this. The ending is not open, so much as pointless. As a short film this would have been excellent, at two hours it's tedious.

I was almost shocked when I heard that this movie was selected as the Swedish entry for the Academy awards. This movie really is a portrait of its time. I sat through the screening for two hours and felt a little disgusted that I paid the price of the ticket.

The movie really tries to depict your "typical" family father Tomas that works to much, has little interest in his wife and kids, can't show any emotions, and runs away as soon as he gets in danger. During the last few years Sweden has had a major social debate around gender roles and especially male gender roles, and the "macho-culture". It really shows in this movie! Even with a slightly interesting story about a man learning not to take things for granted in his life, the movie just feels like a two-hour rant at the "modern man" Tomas who should feel so bad about himself. He thinks he is so good with his successful job but he is nothing more than a coward, that really the boiled down message of this film.

And it's not even two good hours, no! You have a minute long scene with the whole family brushing their teeth, nothing else! No dialog, no interaction. Half the shots are stationary, distant shots. You can't help getting the feeling of shouting "Just cut already". An emotional drama does not need to have action-film type camera style, it looks so much better with calm camera work. But this movie sometimes feel like they forgot to turn off the camera in between takes, and then that footage just happened to get leads to the great avalanche suspense that the movie builds around feels extremely anti-climactic.

Unless you have a major in gender studies, the concentration span of a mentally challenged sloth, or you suffer from insomnia, stay away from this movie!

Deary me, I've sat through some achingly self-important snoozefests in my time but this might just take the biscuit. Less than 3 minutes into Force Majeure it becomes clear it's one of those movies where the director automatically assumes his work is so profound and so cosmically blessed with untouchable genius that the audience will be glued to every microsecond, spellbound by his gift to the artform. Whereas in reality what we have is a 2 hour film where nothing happens, and we are repeatedly subjected to shots of men women and children urinating. But it's urination as high-art, of course. Not just casually having a slash, but instead striking a pose and emptying their bladders with glacial 1000 yard stares. Genius.

I have no idea what this movie was about. Any scene that could've been done and dusted in 30 seconds instead took approximately 532 years. A few times I thought the cameraman must've died mid-scene, or just wandered off. If there was a story in here somewhere, I don't know what it was because I kept getting so bored that I forgot what I was watching. Was this supposed to be a human drama with no drama? Was it a revenge flick with no revenge? A comedy with no laughs? In fact the very last scene (I can't call it a climax...climax of what?) is so ludicrously pompous that I couldn't help laughing at it. So for that I'll save Force Majeure from getting 1 star, and give it a beyond generous 2 stars.

A movie about drama of a(guessing) middle to upper class spoiled European family on skiing. And about how they brush they teeth... True, European movies tend to have a different tempo than Hollywood production but this was just way too slow. Two hours that can be fitted in effective 30- 40 min the top, everything else are just empty shots of people brushing their teeth, urinating, children eating ice-cream, sitting in ski chairs, walking, skiing...scenes without really any value, neither dramatic nor artistic- the photography is bad as well as is editing (if there was any, really). I really don't see the point of this movie and even less why the hell it had to last two hours. Utterly boring... One star for few good dialogues.

All you need to know about this movie, you can glean from the extras where the director indicates that he got the idea for this film from a You Tube video. You Tube indeed. This movie is a great example of the lack of creative genius in film making from a couple of generations of folks who didn't read much, but instead educated themselves from TV and the Internet blogs. The premise of this movie is not original; a couple is forced (hence the title, I gander) to confront their true feelings, fears and regrets, when a near death experience befalls them. Fair enough, but once the avalanche falls short, so does the writing and directing. We are left with caricatures not real characters and symbolism that is way too obvious. Okay, I get it the omnipresent janitor is supposed to be God watching over the inhabitants of the ski-lodge world. The explosions and creaking machinery is life moving forward, etc., etc. The peripheral skiers are no less predictable. There are the May-December couple/friends who are made to feel uneasy at the trauma between the couple before them, but then buy in to it and start to traumatize each other. Hey, jump into the hot tub, the water's great! There is the cocktail lady friend who revels in her open relationship, seemingly shocking the female protagonist. You can do that? Please. By the last frames I was rooting for the bus to drive off the side of the road and into a deep ravine, killing this cast and giving us some hope for the future of movie making.

They have used an unfortunate event in the lives of this family and made a story around it. It drags on and on and on with long drawn out scenes of mountains, faces of the characters thinking, and seemingly unrelated events. 

And what's with this fixation with urinating? Three times by various family members? Come on. We found the movie totally unsatisfying, hard to follow, long pauses of unexplained silence and a general wandering story line. 

We saw it on a netflix DVD and would not recommend it to anyone. Sorry but that's how we saw it.

A Swedish family is on a break in the French Alps; mother father and daughter and son. They intend to have some 'family time' and do some skiing, on their first day they are having lunch at a mountain top restaurant when they see a 'controlled avalanche'. It though is a bit more boisterous than planned and everyone thinks they are going to be engulfed.

What happens next will cast a pall over the family bigger than the avalanche smoke that settles over them as they realize they are safe.

Now this is one of those films that takes an idea and blows it up big time. The families reactions mean that sides have to be taken and every aspect of their inter familial relationships are brought under a microscope. The acting is all excellent and the effects are stunning as indeed is the landscape. It is in English, Swedish and French with good sub titles. This was Sweden's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards but did not get very far. It is a good film, but not a great one and I read somewhere that this film should not be watched by spouses together - just in case it has resonance with you. I think that may be sage advice - either way this is a film I quite enjoyed and it is memorable too so recommended.

'FORCE MAJEURE': Four Stars (Out of Five)

Swedish drama flick about a family on holiday in the French Alps, who survive an avalanche; which then puts the father's courage, and family value, in question (as he abandoned his family to save himself). The film was written and directed by Ruben Ostlund and stars Johannes Kuhnke and Lisa Loven Kongsli. It's one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014 and was nominated for a Golden Globe; for Best Foreign Language Film. I found it to be a pretty interesting and dramatically intense character study. 

The film tells the story of a Swedish family vacationing in the French Alps. One day, during lunch at a beautiful mountainside restaurant, the family is hit by an avalanche, along with other restaurant customers. Everyone is safe but it becomes apparent to the wife, Ebba (Kongsli), that her husband, Tomas (Kuhnke), had fled the scene by himself; leaving the family to fend for themselves. This really bothers Ebba, who proceeds to harass Tomas about it, for the rest of their ski trip. Tomas tries to deny his cowardly actions ever took place, as he lets the event eat him up inside. 

The movie kind of deals with everyone's worst fears; 'how would you react in a traumatic life threatening situation?', 'would you be the heroic person you would want to be?'. These are fears that have haunted me, at times. I think I'd be brave, and do the right thing, but no one really knows for sure; until they're in that situation. The film is pretty insightful in that way and it's also very disturbing. The harassment, from the wife, makes the film feel very disheartening. There is a twist ending, as well, that provides a little more emotional satisfaction for everyone. It's a well made drama film, but pretty hard to sit through.
