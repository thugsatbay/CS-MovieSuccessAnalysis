### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I have not seen every Disney Pixar film. The ones I have watched are the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc and it's sequel Monster University, a Bugs Life, Cars, Finding Nemo & The Incredibles. The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen!

The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school.

This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley. 

I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra.

The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one.

The film was awful and extremely boring. It was just so depressing and sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...why why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over and over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I was dreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar films should stick to what they are good at and that's making children (and adults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never have been made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can never get back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry.

talk about lack luster in this movie and lack of joy , i had to endure watching this movie which had an awful plot , about some little girl with emotional center something goes screwy and she gets depressed and almost leaves home only to learn crying is good at the end . like how does that appeal to everyone ? talk about boring .The animated design for the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff together you had so many classic movies that would make this look like a piece of crap e.g wall-e , Up , incredible , monster inc, monsters university , brave, toy story1-3, ratatouille etc . Please bring those kinds of movies with great plot and fire the writers and director who wrote this movie . they should never set foot in the pixar company EVER!!

This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited to see it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and not worth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this movie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for this movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on "reputable" websites. The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you want to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. The emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that falls apart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of this movie will remain.

I am genuinely confused as to why people are calling this "Pixar's Best" or an original concept. Pixar has done far better than this and even the mediocre 'Brave' and 'Cars' are far better.

Not only is the concept of 'people controlling your brain' tired and used multiple times, they managed to make it even more boring. There is absolutely no nuance in this film. The characters, (joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness), are a visual representation of their emotion. I mean seriously, do they understand subtlety at all? Anger literally catches on fire, sadness is blue, and joy looks like every boring same-faced cartoon princess. Not to mention none of the emotions look like Riley, the little girl. This is even more of a flaw when we later see the emotions in other characters heads, (Riley's parents, her teacher, etc.) who look just like the person whose brain they inhabit. Why would Riley be the only one whose emotions all look nothing like her? They took an old concept, made it incredibly literal, and then botched it up with inconsistencies. 

Aside from the boring concept, this movie is way too complex and depressing for children. The plot is nearly nonexistent and the most constant thing throughout is joy and sadness attempting to get back to the control center of Riley's brain after being sucked out by accident. Other than that its all very dull and if it doesn't make you cry, you'll probably fall asleep. There are, from what I remember, no laugh out loud jokes. Way too much time went into world-building and showing off the various landscapes and rooms of Riley's mind for there to be any actual storyline. Everything felt extremely dragged out and joy and sadness ran into obstacle after obstacle trying to get back to the control center. Finally, Riley tries to run away and it just so happens that joy returns and fixes everything before she has the chance to get too far. Not only was it absurd for an 11 year old girl to try and take a bus back home, it was far too sad the way the whole thing was shown. 

There were so many random characters introduced for 5 seconds which served no purpose other than to lighten the mood, and they failed at that too. Bing Bong the imaginary friend who was a furry pink elephant was out of place and his design was really uncreative. When he died, I honestly felt relieved not to hear his irritating voice any more. He had no personality or character development and therefore there wasn't any reason to feel sad when he died. Unles of course you're a little kid in which case the whole thing was way too heavy. Either way its a definite miss.

And for those saying only psychology majors can enjoy this movie, that's not true. I can't imagine anyone honestly liking this movie. Aside from the complete inaccuracy of anyone feeling only one emotion at a time, everything about this movie was casually ableist. The portrayal of depression as being something small and easily gotten over was incorrect and terrible. Even the advertisements ("Meet the Little Voices Inside Your Head") felt like an insensitive joke towards people with schizophrenia or other disorders who have auditory hallucinations.

Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Too depressing and confusing for kids, too boring and literal for adults, this movie is enjoyable by no one. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups. The one redeeming factor was the animation, which was good but all the designs were so uncreative that good animation couldn't save it.

The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but. 

It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children. 

The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying "take Riley to the moon for me". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable.

There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there.

So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered.

Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this.

I went to see this with my 6 year old and 12 year old and we all left depressed and hating the movie. Disney needs to remember they are in the "entertainment" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the "fantasy" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead.

This still had some appeal as a trailer but sadly as a whole it felt flat pretty fast.

The whole movie had a depressing effect and this became more obvious as the movie progressed.

The basic story was some what ridiculous about only 5 characters controlling your brain similar to the factions in divergent(same screenplay writer perhaps?)

Of the 5 characters 2 are highlighted and both of them (Joy and Sadness)are just annoying and the 3 side characters are totally forgettable.

Problem here is they always react the same making it very predictable and there for equals boring.

It has not been a good animation year, only the penguins worked and Minions and now this one really failed miserable.

So,please ,put the fun and laughs back in these movies and stop with putting adult subjects in to kids movies. That might have worked once but at this point you're overdoing it.

I think this one was rushed and not as well worked out as previous installments by pixar and I do hope they find they're way again and return to the classics we all know and love.

Re-animate.

This movie is terrible and it is for babies. Don't let the ratings fool you. Do not watch this movie it is terrible. I thought is was going to be so good but it turned out terrible.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. In my recommendation this movie is terrible and like any old movie it has a happy ending. Their solution could have been though of at the beginning of the movie. Just fly a cloud there and get back. And stupid joy is just selfish. She just grew a brain. That's all that happened in the movie. The only other things were growing more islands and upgrading their controls. KILL THIS MOVIE! The fact that this movie could have been less than an hour disappoints me. In conclusion, this movie sucks

I'm a kid who I think this meant to appeal to but what happens is everything it looks like something good is gonna happen it just ends up being something completely random like when they get on the train it just happened to be to late at the time when they got on the train and joy is one of the meanest characters if ever seen in a movie when she leaves sadness behind at the end and at the end when she try's to run away it's just so depressing the voice acting is terrible I would 100% skip if I'm watching it It's such a lazy idea anyone could have come up with the story in five minutes This movie implies we only have five emotions which is stupid I don't know why it has such a high rating it has no memorable scenes in it no excitement I'd definitely watch something else

This movie was just disgusting. First off, there are so many other terrible review giving this one star, and many people find those reviews helpful. The movie only stars like 4 or 5 emotions in people's heads, 4 or 5, I forgot, and frankly don't care since this movie was complete garbage. I "watched" this movie at a potluck at a friend's house but ended up playing ping pong with a friend the whole time since the movie failed to attract my attention. This movie is not suitable for kids as well. I do not understand why it is on the IMDb top 250 list, it should be on the bottom 100 list. This movie can scar kids and make some people actually depressed. It is quite depressing that there are such limited emotions and little activity in the brain expressed in the movie. I was actually depressed after watching this movie and found myself in a bitter state lacking interest in activities I usually cherish. Why? Because this stupid movie is trying to tell me what is in my brain and is completely corrupting. I was emotionless after the movie just like how the movie is. I'm sure the disgust emotion in the movie would be disgusted at the movie.

I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie. 

I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative, especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me.

Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up (I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their thousands of old grey memories still intact? 

Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie. I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life depended on it.

There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an "imaginary boyfriend" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to "UP" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.

Yes, my mind is blown away by this movie not because it's spectacular  as it was hailed by many critics but because this movie is super lame  for a studio that has never released a bad movie (edit: i have  forgotten about brave and cars 2 i guess pixar has lost their touch and  that's why they made finding dory) 
CGI wise this movie has an outstanding work like usual but the real  problem is the story. The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for  the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was  actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i  just felt nothing and said "is that it? what the heck?".  
The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably  because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid. 
The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the  imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying  and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable. 
I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this  is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to  write my first review for this abomination of an animation. 
I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i  feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10. 
For those who thinks this is a hate/bandwagon/troll attempt. no this is  solely what i feel about this movie and it's a shame that people are so  against bad reviews. 
TL;DR: this movie lacks a fun.

I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.

The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. 

From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. 

Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.

Usually love Pixar, Toy Story for example, was easy and fun to follow up on the big screen but Inside Out is a jumble of fast talking characters, sudden bursts of sound that'll wake you up when you feel yourself drifting off.

This movie is hard to follow, has a very sophisticated theme and so anyone under 10 probably won't sit through this one.

For example there are about a 1/2 a dozen different characters that represent "feelings" ( anger, sadness, fear etc ) all talking at the same time in some instances. Then there are the complicated explanations of long term/short term memory, REM sleep cycles, I mean, If I were a 5 year old, I wouldn't know what was going on after about 10 mins, I'd be lost.

Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast action accompanied by loud rather jarring music and shrill voices etc.

It's a mess of a movie & definitely not for the very young because they won't understand it, believe me.

Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful. The beginning before the movie started made me already feel that it would not be good. I can see why some people like it but I think there should have been a better storyline.

I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.

There is a problem with psychological reality with this movie. The fact that it is presented as entertainment for children is an extreme negative. One of the most important thrusts of human evolution has been to free humans from the former mental encumbrances of past centuries. In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of entities, the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal. I am concerned as to the sanity of the person(s) who wrote this script. Such a movie disserves the bonfire. I am amazed that our Psychologists are not protesting the showing of this movie which demonstrates only the origins of western psychology - the cocaine importer and addict Sigmund Freud.

I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were "babyish". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.

I don't have a lot of reasons to give. All I can say is that every other Pixar movie I have rated a 10. I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here. I want to caution someone like me to save their money so please read the other reviews with a 1 star rating. Maybe that will help guide you to a different movie to watch.

OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel  c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille  all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel  even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised  even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.

I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. "Joy" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout "shut up and go away!" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears. Leaving before the ending was actually with a feeling of relief at having escaped.

what a complete waste of time - read all the wonderful reviews that are misleading, obviously these are the people that go to Disneyland about 20 times a year - incredibly slow paced, especially after "JOY" & "SADNESS" get sucked into another dimension where they befriend Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom & Dad)

Understanding another person is one of the most difficult tasks a human being experiences. Children, teenagers, and even adults, often gain their knowledge of the world through their surroundings. Since, electronic devices, which display movies and TV shows, are prevalent in today's society, audiences often gravitate to those forms of entertainment and absorb the information. Good movies leave lasting impacts on the minds and hearts of the people who watch the works. In Disney Pixar's Inside Out, the personified emotions that control peoples' feelings, and the core memory spheres are a vital role in a child's understanding of life.

The five emotions stationed in the young girl, Riley's, mind, Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger, and Fear, teach people that the way they feel corresponds to the way they act. If everyone could look into another's head, as audiences viewed in Inside Out, understanding the human race would not be a difficult topic. However, that is not the case. Since this movie directly addresses the thoughts in a human's head, even children can understand the emotions better. The color differentiation of each emotion not only draws attention, but also allows people to understand that there are different ways they can feel. Additionally, this movie allows audiences to understand the human nature by personifying the emotions in another person's head. These specific emotions individually and physically control what Riley does, which directly shows that there is a correspondence between the way a person feels to their actions. The way a human feels controls how they act. For example, when a person is sad, they cry, or when they happy they smile. This movie shows that emotion, thoughts, and actions are all connected: emotions control actions, actions control thoughts and thoughts control how the person feel. In addition to these emotions, the core memory spheres show children that as they grow older, they will have a mixture of emotions in their memories, not just one at a time.

Core memories are important to a development of a child, and Inside Out shows audiences that as people mature, their mind changes with them. The main character, Riley, during the movie is a prepubescent "tween" who moves to a new city. Throughout the events of the movie, Riley only has simplistic feelings. This is directly shown in the movie when only one control platform, and only one emotion controls her at a time. In the end clips of the movie, the audiences get a glimpse of the emotions inside other characters head, including the the main character's parents. The glimpse presents the "matured" minds of her parents, showing all the emotions sitting in a large console where all the emotions can act at together in an organized fashion. Riley's mind, is a mess throughout most of the movie. The events depicted in her mind, show all the emotions cramming together on one small monitor, fighting over who controls her. However, after the events of the movie, Riley's maturing mind beings going through "puberty" as the character, Disgust, points out, and shows all the emotions working together in an "upgraded" control console. Additionally, all of her core memory orbs are only one specific emotion, joy.

Children must learn that they can not be happy all the time, and in the movie, Inside Out, children can better understand they need to experience all emotions. As shown in the movie, Riley's core memories all gleam gold, representing that all her important memories in her life were happy. Joy, who primarily directs the emotions, leads the group and takes over the control board, not allowing Sadness to participate in anything. As Riley tries to run away, her emotions in the control room, not including Joy and Sadness, try to stop her from leaving. Since Joy and Sadness are lost outside the control room, Disgust tries to lead as Joy does and tells Fear to "scare" Riley into staying. However, all the emotions could not get her to feel anything. The lever, telling Riley to react, would not budge. As Joy and Sadness return to the room after their unexpected adventure, the bus Riley is riding begins pulling out. Joy, realizing Sadness is the only emotion that can save Riley, tells Sadness to work the control board. Sadness, hesitantly reaches for the lever and pulls in down. Riley jerks up and runs off the bus, going home. This shows children, that being sadness is an essential emotion, and not a bad. This movie shows that being sad is good, and shows that people are human. As, she enters her house, her parents run and hug her. Riley, starts telling her parents how awful the move was for her and Joy hands Sadness Riley's happy core memories, and they turn blue as they are projected in her mind. Riley begins to cry and smile as her family embraces, and a blue and gold swirled memory orb forms in her head. This specific orb shows, that memories are a mix of emotions. This specific scene shows the sadness Riley feels, mixed with the happy emotions of family. After this specific event, Riley's mind Is shows stronger as ever, with multiples of mixed emotions including fear and disgust. These specific scenes show kids that emotions are not simplistic, that people grow and mature feeling different emotions at the same time.

In the children's movie, Inside Out, people are controlled by five specific emotions, which teach audiences important parts of human life. In modern culture, movies often impact people's minds. Human minds share a connection between, acting, feeling and thinking. Empathy is a feeling not many people experience on a daily basis, but through this movie, it is achievable.
