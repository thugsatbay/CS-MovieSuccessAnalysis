### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.

My fears were unfounded.

SING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I'm close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes' films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.

Sing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor "Cosmo" Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the 'smart one,' pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he's quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.

You could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It's the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.

It's the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won't give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they're outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.

There's also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today's teenagers as well.

The movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I'm thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that's on par with the films I love so much as a kid.

The movie to beat this summer isn't a superhero movie.Its a movie about a teenager forming a band to try and impress a girl. What a wonderful and beautiful movie this. I was smiling and hugging myself throughout. So light and warm hearted and funny and yet deep and powerful. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. It is directed by the great John Carney who directed one of my favorite movies about music, Once. This is one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It stands with Say Anything, Stand By ME, Perks of Being a wallflower, The fault in our stars. Please just go watch this movie. Please. I Loved it. ***** out of 5.

I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. 

I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.

Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone

I'm happy to grade this movie a full blast 10. I was a teenager in 1985 in the last private Catholic Boarding School left in Mexico City. I relate to the strict uniform policy, the angry and imperfect young Catholic brothers still guessing their vocations, the old professors teaching materials for yester years, the canteen food, hiding Walkman radios and sunglasses, talking about bands across the ocean, the girls who wanted to be older and the fashion. This is a happy sad movie, that will keep you tapping and asking why aren't all movies like this. The script is very very smart, the casting couldn't be wiser. Lucy Boynton does an amazing job. The art direction is so precise you can imagine the smell of the flats. The awesome cars. What a great movie!!

Don't miss this!!!

I was a fan of Carney's band the Frames, and was delighted to see his first low budget film , "Once" 

His second wonderful film had a much bigger budget and well know cast, but still a small film. I just loved, "Begin Again" with Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Kiera Knightly.

He goes back to his roots with Sing Street and it is simply a joyful experience. It started off a bit slow for me. But as the band that is the focal point of the film hones their skills and improves so does this wonderful story. I just can't say enough about how great the two leads were in this film Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays the male lead Conor, and Lucy Boynton as Raphina were just wonderful. It is a great film to watch if you are having trouble getting your smile on. 

As an American I had a little trouble at times with the thick Irish accents. When I watch the CD I may have to stick the subtitles on.I wish the film had a bit of a bigger budget in the sense that it looks like it was made on a tiny budget and musicals are much better when the sound is powerful. But that is just quibbling. Go see this in the theaters, if for nothing else to make sure Carney gets money to keep making films.

There's nothing quite like the creative process. We've all had that feeling; unfolding with all its frenzied excitement, malleable thoughts and brainstorms and inventive problem-solving. Yet creativity isn't just limited to what music you make, what stories you write, what paintings you paint. Flexing the limits of your creativity is almost like a window into your identity. Do you look for the easy fix, do you power through despite mental blocks, do you try the unexpected or bend towards an originality or an universality. So it goes with Sing Street, a movie that expands the notion of creativity itself, making an unabashedly and irresistibly charming film.

Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo) and his family live in a charmed dwelling overlooking the urban sprawl of South side Dublin. Due to financial strain, Conor is informed that he's being taken out of his private Jesuit high school and being transferred to a public school nearby. At first, things go miserably. He's hassled by bullies, called names openly in class and harangued by the school's principal Father Baxter (Wycherley). His only solace is watching new wave music videos with his older brother Brendan (Reynor). Things change however with the appearance of the mysterious and strikingly beautiful Raphina (Boynton) who stands on the stoop outside the school. He approaches her and asks her to be in a music video; she agrees. Next step: start a band.

Conor quickly makes friends with a gaggle of outcasts from the school in order to haphazardly start, build and maintain a fledgling little group. Among them is the multi-talented Eamon (McKenna) who can not only play multiple instruments but can put Conor's lyrics to song. It is the moments between these two young artists that best exemplifies the movie's central theme. We share with them the 4am feeling of unbounded imaginative bliss as they riff off each other, clean up their chords and rhythms and ask each other the meaning behind the songs they write. Because of Eamon's father's vocation as a covers band leader, the band not only has a place to practice but instruments to play which benefits the rest of the players as they develop their sound.

Conor uses his band not only for the purpose of wooing the girl but also as a means to escape his increasingly turbulent home life. The marriage between his mother (Doyle Kennedy) and father (Gillen) circles the drain as his dropout brother smokes hash and oozes cynicism and unrealized potential. In one moment of investigation, Brendan points to the mother who sits on the stoop, smoking a cigarette, hoping to catch the last rays of sunshine of the day. With big talk of some day going to Paris, the mother settles on these moments to sulk in bitter reflection. "I cleared a path for you." Brendan says in a moment of defeat. Seems his carefully curated collection of vinyl and his grimacing observations serve as a counterpoint to encourage Conor's brazen dreams.

Yet it's the girl who pushes Conor to the point of unique creative verisimilitude. And as the would-be model that captures the heart of our young hero, Lucy Boynton is an absolute vision. She coyly hints at gigs and glamour in London yet she lives at an all girls boarding house and dates a guy who listens to Genesis. Yet despite outward moments of confident sashaying, behind the makeup and denim there beats the heart of a true romantic and a true creative conduit. "When it comes to art, you never go halfway." she says just after she throws herself into the Irish Sea for the sake of a good video. This moment is immediately followed by Conor responding in kind.

And yes this movie is about a new wave band in the 1980's, so yes there is a lot of hair, makeup, posh scarf wearing and mod style bravado. While today we like to take potshots at the synth-pop aesthetic, there's still something utterly charming about the way it is presented here. Is it nostalgia; probably. Yet there's an unawareness to it, allowing the audience to discover (or re-discover) the trappings of 80's popular music in real time. The excitement Brendan and Conor feel in watching Duran Duran's Rio music video is infectious, and the original songs by the band are easily the best thing about Sing Street.

Conor eventually finds a since of identity within the catchy rhythms of his songs, the jejune charms of Raphina and the kindliness of Brendan's brotherly love. The moments of kitchen sink realism serves not only as a cautionary tale to Conor but to us as well. When we refuse ourselves the rewards of creativity we risk becoming embittered, angry and resentful. In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, "Go into the arts. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow." To put it another way, go create something.

I'm a sucker for movies about musicians, and John Carney has already given us Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). Now he delights once more with Sing Street, a tale told with humor, drama, and some pretty catchy songs, all set in the backdrop of 1980's Dublin.

Yes, Sing Street is set in the 80's so it undeniably lends itself to comic relief as these schoolboys are forced to navigate through hair, makeup, clothing and music video choices along their artistic journey. We get plenty of laughs as we watch them try to forge an identity and look like bona-fide rock stars in this crazy MTV generation. And for good measure, they insert the obligatory Phil Collins joke in the mix.

There is quite a deal of drama as well. We see bullying in an all-boys school, dysfunctional families, the economic hardships of Ireland in the 80's and young people's wish to break out of societal malaise and seek their fortunes elsewhere. I haven't lived in Ireland but the desire to pack your bags and start over in another place is a universal one. Audiences in every continent can relate to that.

The cast is solid and I was very impressed with the leads, especially Ferdia Walsh-Peelo who plays Connor. He can be charming, kind, insecure but out-of-nowhere gutsy which is an accurate depiction of a blossoming musician. After the first hour I began to be doubtful of the character of Connor's brother Brendan for seeming to be too wise for his age, but by the end of the film it all made sense, and Jack Reynor was a fine choice for that role. Lucy Boynton (Raphine) is great as the love interest and mysterious but troubled muse; she packs an emotional performance and probably looks the most natural in 80's fashion, although she didn't quite convince me as a 16 year-old and it wasn't because of all the excess hair and makeup. On the other hand Mr. Walsh-Peelo (Connor) was only 15 when the movie was shot and he's got that boyish appearance. Finally Mark McKenna (Eamon) has such an uncanny resemblance to Julian Lennon it's scary! But a good actor too.

As far as concerns I had only a few major ones but they didn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. First is that the story moves very quickly in the first 30 minutes or so, then takes the foot off the pedal for the remainder. And second, it's a little unrealistic that these kids can write quality songs right out of the blocks. It would have been fun to hear a real stinker when they're starting out. I'm a musician and believe me, our first attempts are pretty bad. That's true even for the all-time best.

There were a few other minor things but they're not worth mentioning. This is a great story, it got all the laughs, cheers and tears in the right places and I would recommend it to everyone, especially those who want to express themselves through art and aspire to greatness. Dream big, all you adolescents. A big thanks to John Carney et al for reminding us of that and making a quality film.

Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.

Mr. Carney was also responsible for two previous music-centric movies, Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). He is an exceptional story teller who puts music at the center, but avoids the label of "musical" by making it about people, rather than notes.

It's 1985 in economically depressed Dublin, and a strong opening sequence introduces us to Connor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) as his ever-arguing parents (Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy) inform him of the economic necessity of pulling him out of prep school and enrolling him into a much tougher environment  one that comes with bullies and hard-nosed teachers/clergy.

Soon enough Connor is hanging with the misfits and inviting an enchanting "older" girl to star in his band's video. She agrees, and wide-eyed Connor quickly sets out to form a band that didn't previously exist.

There are two interesting and fully realized relationships that make this movie click: Connor and the enchanting Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and Connor and his older brother Brendon (Jack Reynor). Brendan is Connor's life mentor and music guru. They are quick to jump on the new world of music videos, and it's a real hoot to watch Connor emulate the style and fashion of Duran, Duran, The Cure, etc.

It's fascinating to note that Connor, while a pretty talented lyricist and singer, doesn't really seem to be in love with the music except as a means to an end  a way to get the girl. That said, the real message here is that while teenagers often feel like they can't fix the outside world (parents, teachers, bullies), they can fix themselves by finding a passion in life (the movie uses the term vocation).

It's hard not to notice the influence of such filmmakers as John Hughes and Cameron Crowe, and Carney certainly brings his touch of romanticism. Plus, one must appreciate any movie that delivers an original song as catchy as "Drive it like you Stole it", while also taking a shot at Phil Collins. It's a funny and sweet movie that should really catch on through positive word of mouth.

It's a few days before the end of May, 2016, and the year in film might already be over as far as I'm concerned. It did not seem that way to me after the first time I saw this film - the "Mary Sue"-ism of the band's progress in quality, the strange appearance of a 1987 song in a 1985-set film (Starship's track at the party towards the end - from the movie 'Mannequin'), me asking myself which characters were responsible for editing the music video for 'Riddle of the Model' so decently / well?, and a couple more quibbles. These minor details became less important by the second viewing, and completely unimportant by the third and fourth viewings. They were replaced by: the girl that inspires your work, the work that allows you to ignore your current circumstances, the "adults", however few they may be, that actually notice what you're doing and encourage you / help you / are happily there for you, the friends you make as a result of putting yourself "out there", the joy of coming up with new material, "who are you, Steely Dan?", the fantastic storyline with Barry - the 'bully' who is incorporated into the group as the roadie with M's "Pop Musik" playing in the background, Brendan and Raphina meeting towards the end of the film, Eamon's mother (hahah), Flash and the Pan's "Waiting for a Train", The Cure on a film soundtrack, "Depech-E Mode", cookies between kisses, and Raphina... and Brendan. When even Adam Levine works perfectly for the film's ending, you know things are clicking.

On a side note: my profile has my location as San Juan, Puerto Rico, but I did not see this film there... since it has not been shown there, and I unfortunately would not be surprised if it ended up not showing there at all before home video (hope I'm wrong).

On a second side note: while in early high school, we tried to make a music video to compete in MTV's make-a-video contest for Madonna's track 'True Blue'... and failed impressively. Hence my immediately noticing the editing in 'RotM' :)

Sing Street is another of director John Carney's sweet and entertaining tributes to musicians and love following the magnificent Once and the appealing Begin Again. Sing Street is perhaps ultimately the most endearing of the three films as it follows young Conor ( Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in an exceptional film debut) as he forms a band with fellow outcasts at his Dublin Catholic school and as he attempts to woo Raphina (the lovely Lucy Boynton), who appears in the group's music videos. Sing Street sets its action in the 1980s, the glory era of music videos and modern pop music. The film treats the vintage music used throughout with fond remembrance, and it is a true joy to hear blissfully wonderful songs by Duran Duran, Hall and Oates, Spandau Ballet, Starship, Genesis (even if the song is dumped upon by other characters), and The Cure. While this music is sensational, what really helps Sing Street to become a must-see is its wonderful ensemble cast (Jack Reynor is a true force of nature in the role of Conor's older brother, Brendan, who has made mistakes that he wants to save his younger brother from making), its appealing story, and brilliant new songs that feel like the 80s are back again. Walsh-Peelo and Boynton have great chemistry together, and their scenes together are funny, honest, and sweetly poignant. Likewise, Walsh-Peelo is also convincing in the scenes involving his interactions with fellow band members. Of the new songs, "Up" is a great power anthem, "The Riddle of the Model" has a good avant-garde approach, "Girls" and "Brown Shoes" are both solid, "A Beautiful Sea" is wonderful in the little bit of it that is heard, "To Find You" is a moving ballad and very poignant, Adam Levine's closing song "Go Now" is terrific, but the true standout song is the high-energy "Drive It Like You Stole It". This song, an extremely catchy and bouncy concoction that sounds like some of the best 80s pop, is staged in a fantasy sequence that serves as a homage to Back to the Future, and the scene is filled with so much joy and poignancy that to watch it is to be reminded that it is for scenes like this that we go to the movies in the first place. The ending of the film too is magnificent, a lilting end to a truly marvelous film. Sing Street is definitely one to savor.

Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school  both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not "enough" of something. Well, I say "enough already"  and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama "Sing Street" (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. "Happy-Sad" the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.

Conor Lalor (Ferdia Walsh Peelo) is, in many ways, a typical 15-year-old. He goes to school, where he has both friends and enemies. He has family members who love him, but also add challenges to his life. And, of course, he wants to earn the affections of someone special who has caught his eye. The details of the framework of Conor's life may differ from yours (as well as his gender, interests, location and even time period), but he should be easy to relate to  for anyone who attended (or is now attending) high school.

As for Conor, he lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. He has a brother (six years older) named Brendan (Jack Raynor), who is out of school but still lives at home, and a younger sister named Ann (Kelly Thornton). Their parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) argue  loudly  about money, their kids, their marriage, etc. Conor has the experience of changing schools, starting at Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where, as the new kid, he quickly runs afoul of the principal (Don Wycherly) and the school bully (Ian Kelly). However, Conor soon makes a friend named Darren (Ben Carolan) and is quite taken by a mysterious girl named Raphina (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street from the school.

As a way of getting to know Raphina, Conor asks her to be in a music video for his band. She agrees, so now all Conor has to do is start a band! He gets Darren to be the band's manager  slash  music video producer. Darren introduces Conor to Eamon (Mark McKenna), who is skilled at a variety of instruments. After the guys recruit from among their school mates, adding friends Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Gary (Karl Rice), along with Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), the only black kid at Synge Street CBS, they choose "Sing Street" as the name of their band, and start working on their band's musical and visual identity.

Heavily influenced by early-mid 1980s acts like The Cure, Joe Jackson and Hall & Oates (whose songs appear in the soundtrack), Sing Street works up a cover of Duran Duran's "Rio" and then Conor and Eamon start writing original songs together. Brendan makes use of his misspent youth to school his younger brother in the finer points of modern music and encourages Conor to stretch musically. Soon, Raphina becomes Conor's muse and a regular in Sing Street's videos. Raphina and Conor also grow closer, in spite of her "it's complicated" relationship status and her plan to move to London to model.

"Sing Street" features a whole lot of talent  on both sides of the camera  and the microphone. Carney's direction and his script are sensitive, engaging and fun. The story has a lot going on, but still keeps things simple, and derives its entertainment value from a variety of sources. The drama comes from following the development of the band, the relationship between Conor and Raphina, the relationships within Conor's house and Conor's problems at school. The comedy comes from the behavior of the film's colorful characters and the natural awkwardness of teenagers discovering life.

Carney says the film is "wish fulfillment of all of the things I wanted when I was the age of the character and didn't do." To portray a fictionalized version of his own adolescence, he cast unknown, but talented actors  with terrific results. Raynor creates an interesting and passionate character, who is dealing with the fear that life is passing him by. For their part, Walsh-Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life  all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs.

As the main character, Conor's struggles are relatable, his dreams are understandable and his story is enjoyable. The film isn't completely original or realistic, but it's very effective as a representation of the trials, tribulations and potential triumphs of the teenage years, and offers hope as to what could lie ahead  for those who make the most of those years  and the lessons they produce. "You can never do anything by half," is one character's heart-felt proclamation. "Sing Street" continually speaks to the heart  through its comedy, its drama and its wonderful music  and doesn't do it by half. "A-"

Ah, the joy and pain of first love! Young Conor (aka Cosmo, played in his impressive debut by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) has the smelly end of a shitty stick to deal with while growing up in 1980's Dublin. He has warring parents with the need  for financial reasons - to move Conor from his posh school to 'Singe Street' Catholic school: a decidedly rougher and tougher place, ruled over with a rod of iron by Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley). This is a place of chaos and mayhem, ruled over by bullies of the likes of Barry (a superbly intimidating Ian Kenny).

The 15 year old Conor tries punching above his weight with the lovely 16 year old Raphina (Lucy Boynton)  a struggling wannabe model with "mysterious eyes" who hangs around outside the Woman's Refuge opposite the school. To get her number, he claims to head up a band and to need her help with the band's video. One small problem: there is no band and Conor has limited musical ability! He gathers around him a motley crew of friends, and with the help of his stoner brother (Jack Raynor) and his extensive vinyl collection, goes about creating a band to gain fame and fortune (or at least the girl).

This is a film that works on so many levels. As a piece of nostalgia for us older folks, the sights and sounds of the 80's are brought vividly back to life, with a rocking soundtrack of the likes of Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet to enjoy. And as a coming of age movie, the long lingering looks, embarrassment and discomfort of first-dating is both touching and painful to watch, with the best Rich-Tea fuelled snog ever put on screen! Few films in fact have come this close to depicting this glorious ineptitude since John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn struggled to get together in Bill Forsyth's "Gregory's Girl" (making me feel ancient, this was actually set in 1981!).

It should be noted that at one point the film also models the casual racism prevalent at the time, with perhaps only the addition of a rebuking "You can't say things like that" striking a less realistic note. 

This is a film where nearly everyone is damaged in one way or another  drugs; hopeless ambition; child abuse; paedophilia, alcoholism; bullying; (the list goes on). However, the hugely intelligent script by writer and director John Carney drips the issues out in such tiny insinuations and snippets of conversation that it feels lifelike: not as if the film-maker is beating you over the head with it. This is just a poor Dublin life in the 80's: get on with it.

All of this might make you think this is a hugely depressing, kitchen-sink type of drama that will leave you, at the end of the evening, in dire need of a box-set of "Father Ted" to cheer you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the same way as the music in Alan Parker's 1991 Dublin-set classic "The Commitments" - and indeed 2013's excellent Belfast-based "Good Vibrations" - lifted the spirits, so the drive and energy of the soundtrack makes the film a hugely uplifting experience. Besides the classic 80's stuff there are some really great original songs (co-written by the multi- talented John Carney, with Gary Clark): I was still humming "Drive It Like You Stole It" in the car park. 

The young cast throw themselves into the job with great energy, with Walsh-Peelo and Boynton delivering touching and impressive performances and Mark McKenna particularly worthy of note channeling a young John Lennon. My top acting accolade though goes to Jack Raynor (who was until recently rumoured to be in the running for the role of the young Han Solo: a role that's now just gone to "Hail Caesar's" Alden Ehrenreich). Playing Conor's older and wiser brother, his frustration at his role in life boils over in a vinyl- smashing and hugely impressive rant that I would like to see credited with a Best Supporting Actor award. And amid all of the teenage love and band efforts, it is this aspect of brotherly love that eventually shines out as the beating heart of the film. 

The film is a little rough at the edges  a dream sequence looks like it could have had a few more dollars thrown at it - but this often adds to the charm. John Carney seems to have quite an Indie following, but I'm not familiar with his other work. This film left me wanting to dig into his archives. It left my wife gushing with tears from beginning to end! A must see film.

A beautifully balanced, sensibly narrated & splendidly performed indie covering the highs & lows of teenage life while demonstrating the magic of creating music with all the romance of the art in tact Sing Street is a heartfelt ode to the carefree, joyous days of growing up and with its subtle touch of melancholy & hummable soundtrack, delivers an experience that's delightfully captivating.

Set in Dublin, Ireland during the 1980s, Sing Street tells the story of a young kid who is looking for an escape from all his troubles at home where his family is on the verge of falling apart, and at his new school where students & teachers are quite rough. His window of opportunity arrives when, in an attempt to impress a girl, he invites her to star in his band's music videos despite not being a part of one.

Written & directed by John Carney, the movie packs just the right amount of heart, fun, nostalgia, heartaches & optimism and also benefits from the interesting set of characters the writer-director brings to life. The events progress in smooth, effective manner from start to finish while the songs are expertly placed at just the right moments to exquisitely capture the underlying context of the emotions on surface.

Production design team does well to nicely capture the period details of the timeline its plot is set in. Cinematography encapsulates the entire feature with an overcast ambiance with warm & cold colours utilised as per the scene requirements. Editing provides a steady pace to its 105 minutes narrative with each scene only taking the story forward while songs are composed from scratch and have an infectious quality to them.

Coming to the performances, Sing Street features a relatively unknown but incredibly committed cast in Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Mark McKenna, Jack Raynor, Aidan Gillen & Maria Doyle Kennedy and everyone does an excellent job with what they are given. Walsh-Peelo in particular is a standout and shares brilliant chemistry with both Boynton & McKenna while Raynor pretty much steals the show in every scene he appears in.

On an overall scale, Sing Street is the feel-good movie of the year that's euphonic in both happy & sad moments and manages to incorporate a mix of both with amazing comfort. A healthy dose of entertainment that treads the fine line between wishful fantasy & cold reality that promises plenty of laughs & hints of tears, this bittersweet coming-of-age musical comedy hits the right chords at the right time throughout its runtime and is one of the best films of 2016. Definitely recommended.

I want to explain my rating system. I usually consider a 9 an A 8 a B, etc BUT adjust base off how overrated a movie is. I initially gave this a 9 but had to change it seeing the ridiculous praise.

Again, I stress it's perfectly good and you should see it BUT Sing Street is really overrated. It's one of those I enjoyed but you realize flaws in retrospect.

The movie is a thematic mess. It's about "living the dream" (and is really one the nose with it) but fails to explore it (especially since La La Land did it way better). Instead of being about him doing the band because he enjoys it, he does it entirely for Raphina completely undercutting its main theme. He is set up as a music prodigy but his brother and friend end up knowing way more and are more deserving of living the dream. Then, he intentionally stops trying in school, fails and is okay with it. This is such an insult to real musicians who go to school to learn the nature of music OR at least have SOME talent!!

Possible spoiler: Then the end is even more ridiculous. He runs away with Raphina to England. It works as feel good but makes no sense: how will he pay? where will he stay? how does he plan on getting accepted anywhere with no talent? what happens when he and Raphina go through a high school break up like EVERY other high school? what will he tell his parents?

This movie is a ridiculous, overrated movie that is perfectly okay.﻿

I needed a movie like this in 2016, and I wish it could have come earlier. I didn't know they had decided to keep making films like this. 

'Sing Street', on the surface, is a funny teenage movie about an Irish boy who starts a punk rock band in the 1980s to impress a girl he likes. This premise alone made me want to see it; it sounded hugely enjoyable for someone who loves rock and roll and loves (certain) teen movies. And I wasn't wrong, I had a great time with the film. But it's definitely more than what it sounds. 

The movie reminds me so much of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', which is important to acknowledge because that film is one of the defining teen movies of a century devoid of good teen movies. I could count the 21st century gems on one hand, and the other lackluster attempts on ten. Both of these movies succeed in calling back to the glorious John Hughes era. They use their characters right, the dialogue works, and it's relatable for a teen audience. 

'Sing Street' is about rebellion. About taking control of one's life and making memories, even if the steps you must take to get there seem too steep to climb. It's about finding out who this musically talented boy is through a journey in which his family is torn apart but his friendships are multiplied. It is heartfelt, beautifully shot, and comes complete with a hip soundtrack. One of the best movies of its year. 9/10

Sing Street (2016): Films about people at school forming bands are well known for being 60% more lovable than any other sort, and this movie is no exception.Sing Street,directed by Irish Film maker John Carney,has already been nominated for 74th Golden Globe Awards but sadly it will lose it to La La Land.If not for La La Land,Sing Street has all the necessary emotions and qualities to win a best musical movie of 2016.Why am I boasting it up before the review?You will see..

Plot:

SING STREET takes us back to 1980s Dublin seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy named Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who is looking for a break from a home strained by his parents' relationship and money troubles, while trying to adjust to his new inner-city public school where the kids are rough and the teachers are rougher. He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, über-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.In a sea of opportunities ahead of them, what does the future hold for a love like this?

Plus Points:

1)Music: Sing Street is brilliant mostly because of its music.Much of the original music by the band "Sing Street" was composed by 80s veteran composer Gary Clark,which really gives us some nostalgic 80's rocking music with meaningful lyrics.For every 5 minutes a song always plays and it played a brilliant part in the movie."The Riddle of the Model" is one of the best track from this movie.I loved the other tracks too.

2)Performances: Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is outstanding in his role and he surely has a bright future ahead.He surely is a Futurist:)When Conor gives an early Sing Street song called The Riddle of the Model to Raphina, he assures her: "It's not about you. It's about another model I know." Walsh-Peelo delivers the line with just the right mixture of shyness and teenage petulance.The other one I liked in this movie is Mark McKenna who played the role Eamon who has talent to play any kind of instrument.Lucy Boynton is lovely.Especially during the shoot of The Riddle of the Model,her expressions are marvelous.Jack Reynor as Brendon is very good in his role.

3)Screenplay and Direction: Sing Street has the most familiar plot for a musical drama but John Carney successfully made such a beautiful engaging drama with a perfect script.Sing Street is, in fact, a delightful coming-of-age tale that both celebrates young love and laments how quickly the fire of youth can be snuffed out. Director John Carney knows exactly how to mesh storytelling and music into his films.He is the next best after Damien Chazelle in directing a perfect musical picture.A great applause for Carney.

So,Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.One of the best musicals in recent times.

My rating 8/10

Had heard so many good things about this and had really wanted to see it but it didn't come to my local world of cine so I missed out during its theatrical run and one thing or another had made me not catch up later, but I was determined to see it before the year was out as I thought it might be one of my favourite films, and I was right. I had really enjoyed Begin Again and Once was one of my favourite films when I saw it so I am a fan of director Carney's work and in this he's right back up to Once's standards. I was enjoying it from the start, helped by the 1980's setting which was when I was in senior school just like the protagonists and which the film perfectly portrays, but was not blown away. But as it progressed it just crept into my being, filling me up with its energy, heart, sole and most of all its music and the joy and exuberance of its creators. The young cast here shine, from our hero, to his bully nemesis, taking in along the way the heroes dream girl, his band of misfits, and the worlds ultimate big brother. Sure, for a group of school kids they are unrealistically good at writing and performing their various pastiches of several 80's pop styles, but the songs are incredibly catchy and the homemade videos they create for them are very funny and perfectly of the era. If you don't leave this film with a song in your heart and a smile on your face, then your dead inside.

While we have not seen so simply and yet so Special for this kind of movie, charming from start to finish with a freshness and despite major cast of rookies a imposing professionalism. The message is clear from half the film, which leaves nothing to chance. With a very sensitive issue and deep.

The soundtrack deserves a separate paragraph where we remember those glorious years of rock, and as mutates over time a It forms so well treated, from its essence to fashion and more.

A highly recommendable film that left us with a taste nostalgic sweet and melancholy.

To sit and enjoy.

I really was not expecting to like Sing Street since I am not a fan of quirky teenage movies (I was very wrong by assuming this movie was that kind of movie). At the end of the movie I stood with satisfaction and a smile in my face.

This movie has very good and well-rounded characters that give depth to the story and help you get invested in their lives. I believe that the characters are the best part of this film, I really got to understand the motivations of all the characters and a little bit of backstory.

The music is great as well, every song (original and soundtrack) is really catchy and goes hand in hand with the tone of the film.

Another aspect I really liked about the film was its style. The color grading in the movie is wonderful and the cinematography is very good.

I could say that the pacing in the movie is kind of off, because at the beginning it moves really fast and then kind of slows by the end. In my opinion, the end has a better pace than the beginning but that is just a nitpick.

This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.

It is been a long time since Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' the last time Hollywood has deliver such an electrifying feel-good musical comedy like this one. This film operates with immense charm and lyrical optimism, and the musical performances by the young cast provide more than a hefty hand for fueling this film's elegant appeal. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo provides an appealing force to be reckon with his singing. Every scene the band play, his voice shines like gold. The musical numbers are far from the classic-type songs that will leave a lasting appeal for many years to come, but they are very lively and not impossible for pinning viewers with the urge to stand up and cheer. The music leaves plenty of room for alluring nostalgia of popular rock music from the 80s. When the atmosphere is not flowing with musical numbers, there is a share humor to handed from the wide cast of characters. The lead character in particular is strongly likable, along with the supporting characters he recruits into his band. One of the sparkling points to the story is the chemistry between Peelo and Lucy Boynton, a romance that while nothing necessarily remarkable, definitely fuels the groovy atmosphere. Jack Reynor who plays the lead character's older brother is quite likable as well, a character who's stuck on the sidelines of the world of adult responsibilities. This guy comes as a form of inspiration to the lead character's optimism and willingness to success.

Sing Street is a heartwarming, feel-good musical comedy with an appeal that is nearly irresistible. This movie is an elegant surprise that is likely to appeal to more than just the crowd of music fanatics. Jim Carney sets out to orchestrate a sensational music-based entry, and it excels greatly here, if not breaking any grounds.

I'm not quite sure what everyone sees in Sing street that I don't, it's a dull, predictable and cliché film. The music in the film is good but it's hardly enough to make up for everything else, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen but I wouldn't say its good either. I wanted to like this movie I really did but sadly I just can't.

"Sing Street" is this year's entry in the UK/Ireland coming-of-age movie genre. These movies are generally a treat. You get some reality from these movies that you don't generally get from coming- of-age films from the US. When a movie hits some real notes you watch closely, thinking that it might be about to break free from the reins of cliché and show you something different. You generally also get poignancy in the bargain: truth hits home.

"Sing Street" starts like that, and it starts well. Connor is a fifteen year old high school kid who has to change schools due to financial difficulty his constantly warring parents are experiencing. The school is a nightmare, filled with bullies, delinquents, and teachers as violent as both.

Connor has a plan, though: he wants to start a band. He does this with an ease that feels a bit contrived. In fact, everything that happens with the band seems too easy: all the members can play adequately from the get go, despite only being in their middle teens, and they come together much quicker than seems likely. When Connor sings, the voice doesn't sound like it comes from his body, or even from the environment the character is in. It sounds like it comes from a recording studio, and a man much older with more training, and maybe even some studio effects to balance it out.

If Connor can sing this well, why is he looking to start a band with a bunch of school friends? Shouldn't he be on "Top of the Pops"?

"Sing Street" is a movie that starts like a breath of fresh air, a movie that could end up containing truth. Alas, it doesn't; it heads into cliché territory and never really looks back.

This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl.

"Sing Street" is a low budget film, with no fancy sets and no fancy clothes. However, it has this mysterious aura around it, and I like it a lot. The main character, Conor, is a very likable youngster, and I particularly feel for him because of his experience in school with the bullies and the headmaster. His friends are all very realistic and down to earth. The whole film breathes of positivity, as it tells a tale of chasing dreams, breaking out of the comfort zone and living the life you want. Maybe that's what attracts me to the film. And of course, the very nice songs that the band performs also make me like the film loads. It is unusual that I like the songs in a film about music, but in this film I find myself singing along to that song "Drive it Like You Stole It". I enjoyed watching "Sing Street".

John Carney was surely someone who I very much looked forward to after creating the indie gem Once. Begin Again was solid, but a little inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. This is much more like it. Boasting a coming-of-age drama as well as a music film, he unleashes some really memorable and likable characters that carry us through this charming, sweet film. I don't think it does anything too extraordinary, and the music isn't to the same level as the music from Once (few music is) but it's really good and entertaining, not to mention very emotionally- investing. That final scene is also really magical and beautiful and surely to resonate with a lot.

I was looking forward to the movie after having seen "Once" and having liked it. That movie had good ambiance, well-made and well-placed music and likable characters. Also, this movie had great reviews here so thought it would be along the same lines of quality. 

Well, it wasn't. Seriously, this movie was a complete waste of time. The movie just recycles common teen movie clichés - but worse than what has been done before. The music is not good enough to carry the movie, really. And the movie is not really documenting great times or developments in history. The main character is just annoying and all characters underdeveloped. I really don't understand why the movie is made in the first place. 

I definitely do not recommend and I do not understand why it is getting such good reviews.
