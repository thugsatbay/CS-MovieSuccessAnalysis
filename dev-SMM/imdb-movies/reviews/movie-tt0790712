### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Brilliantly acted film depicting two soldiers whose job it is to inform families when loved ones are killed in battle. Harrelson has never been better and Foster more than matches him all the way. It's emotional and engaging and genuinely painful at times. I had always thought how hard it must be to carry out such a job but had never really considered just what psychologically damage it could do long term to the person doing it. Harrelson depicts a man who has been doing the job far too long brilliantly and Foster in turn shows just what it can do to you initially. It's a perfect blend and the chemistry is excellent from start to finish. Deserves a much wider release and is with out doubt one of the best films of last year.

The Messenger has incredible acting by Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson, and Samantha Morton. 

The film has a curious flow to it. It begins predictable, yet remains engaging, exposing a heart-breaking consequence of war no family wants to face. Although the news remains the same, emotions run just as deep at each door. Every scene is handled marvelously through subtle performances by the actors. As the film unfolds, the viewer sinks into the complex characters on screen, discomforted by the internal struggles that slowly surface. 

The Messenger is a non-linear, character-driven film with exceptional performances but might not be for everyone.

I saw The Messenger (as well as Oren Moverman and Ben Foster luckily) at the 2009 Philadelphia Film Festival and can say sincerely that I was captivated and moved by it for the majority of its runtime. No matter what your background or stance on the war, you need not worry because it is not a movie that attempts to have an opinion, but merely one that captures a different kind of war- one between civilians and the military, between following procedure and following what you believe.

In his last three months of service, Officer Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), is assigned to be a messenger to next-of-kins who have died in Iraq alongside the elder Lieutenant Anthony Stone (Woody Harrelson). He struggles with being the bearer of bad news to heartbroken parents and wives, delivering the messages to people of all ages, ethnicities, and social classes. His work becomes compromised, however, when complications with his girlfriend arise and he becomes involved with one of the widows, challenging his ethical and moral considerations. He plays the younger, more vulnerable to Harrelson's gruff, uncompromising, and often cold ethic.

The film is, in a word, compassionate, as it is almost entirely character-driven. The chemistry between Foster and Harrelson is incredible, demonstrating talent beyond the range of what one would expect for both actors. I would be very surprised if either one of these two were not nominated for an Academy Award. The cinematography is also very unusual, filmed in long takes, letting scenes unfold, rather than wide/medium/close- up/reverse formula, and heavily based on improvisation.

All in all, The Messenger is a touching story about the differences we can make in others' lives simply by being the right person to break the news and having an open heart. It's a tribute to the men and women in arms without letting political differences get in the way. A story of the war at home shared alike by civilians and military, it's hard not to feel emotionally affected.

I was fortunate enough to see this at the recent NY Drama Critics showcase, where both the director (Mr. Moverman) and a co-star (Woody Harrelson) participated in after-show Q&A. First of all, the film is superb - but the summaries I've seen so far do not do justice to what the movie is really about. Sure there are ethical dilemmas, sure there are soldiers who have returned from Iraq. But the great strength of this film is its focus on individual human beings and their reaction to humans' most important concerns: life, death and love. Oren Moverman - accomplishing this so beautifully, accurately and subtly in a small-budget film - is to be congratulated. Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster and Samantha Morton are all magically on the same wavelength in their performances. And the writing (by Camon and Moverman) acknowledges the fact that reasonably intelligent people might be watching... people who don't need every little detail spelled out. Oh yes - I should mention that there's a lot of humor interspersed throughout. The result of all this? The people you meet in this film will stay with you for a very long time - and you'll be glad for that.

I will not reiterate the plot of The Messenger; it has been done exhaustively already. The relevant facts, to me, are: This movie is a work of art in which the intentions of the director, writer, cinematographer and actors are all united. The actors, especially leads Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton, give subtle, nuanced performances. The plot is not cookie-cutter; you cannot guess what is going to happen at every turn. It is serious at its core but is not devoid of humor.

Lately, I have been happier with the older movies I see on cable than the movies showing in theaters. This is the exception.

THE MESSENGER is by far and away one of the best works of art that addresses the deep tragedy behind the current U.S. war in the Middle East that I've seen. THE MESSENGER is an attempt by Director Oren Moverman and screen writer Alessandro Camon to place themselves between the ears of two career soldiers who serve a vital place in U.S. Army Special Services, Casualty Notification teams who inform the families of soldiers that their family member has been killed in battle. As someone who remembers full well the devastating feeling you got in your insides when you saw these teams turn up at the quarters of friends and their families when my own father was serving in Vietnam in the late 1960s, I found the film an important effort.

Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) is a Iraqi war veteran recovering from a battlefield wound who is reassigned to a State Department and United States Army Casualty Notification team, which is led by Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson). Montgomery is also facing an impending breakup with his girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone), who is playing him off against a wealthy, established suitor. When he is assigned to Stone's team, he is at first resentful. The military decorum which is demanded of the Casualty Notification Team is very exacting, with learned routines that come from a spit and polish military professionalism that requires a distance that is extremely difficult to attain. 

What follows is a series of well connected vignettes, in which the younger soldier is asked to stride this nether world between the jaundiced, dry-drunk outlook of the seasoned bearer of bad news, Captain Stone. Stone is a bitter man with some frustrated ambitions of his own, which are revealed late in the film. Obsessed with sexual victories and teeter tottering between professional sobriety and complete emotional collapse, Stone is far from a steady colleague mentor. Encounters between he and Montgomery go into emotional roller coaster as each man learns to accept the other on his own terms while acting out an extremely trying professional military role.

In short time, Montgomery comes into contact with the widow of a soldier who sparks his interest, and becomes torn between professionalism and attraction to the young widow Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton). Montgomery is forced to grow into himself, despite his outward cynicism, and in short time begins to mentor his mentor, Captain Stone. The story has an open ending, with Montgomery seeking to be part of the life of widow Olivia as she is seeking to reestablish herself in New Orleans. No morals are offered, and this is the true strength of the work as a whole. There isn't much humor to be found here, but watch for the scene where a bender fried Montgomery and Stone attend the wedding reception of the woman who has broken Montgomery's heart. The lampoon of upper middle class phoniness is priceless.

The beauty of THE MESSENGER is that it does not fall into the usual pro war or antiwar camps that film making in an era like our own are usually so encumbered with. The film makers are ambitious and restrained. I have no idea whether the plot line is itself "contrived" as some here have argued, which I have to say is a rather ridiculous critique given that movies are rarely anything but "contrived", and this is particularly true of the genre we call the war film. Some who have written here seem to believe that the film discredits the "professionalism" of those who do the work of Stone and Montgomery, as though "professionalism" were itself some sort of fetish that protects one from emotional or mental illness generated by both war time trauma and the mystique of military culture. Such are the times in which we live, ideological blather is rampant.

THE MESSENGER is important because, in the words of that great Vietnam war era politician, the late President Lyndon Baines Johnson, it is art, it shows us who we are, not who we say we are, not who we think we are, but who we are as a people, and as a political culture. At various moments, it is clunky. But it is an early effort to give some true definition about what the debacle in Iraq has done to our culture, and to the people who are expected to do the dirty work of the empire's war machine. It is a rare gem in mainstream contemporary U.S. film making.

After countless inert and strangely uninvolving films that have been released over the last few years and have used the war on terror as a backdrop for their action ("Jarhead," "Rendition," "Stop-Loss," more I can't even recall at the moment), 2009 produced two films that finally feel plugged directly into the tone the war has taken in our culture -- one of wearying sadness.

One of those films was "The Hurt Locker," and the other is "The Messenger," Oren Moverman's somber and haunting story about a troubled soldier back from the front lines who's assigned the task of notifying people about the deaths of their loved ones in the conflict. I can't vouch for the accuracy of either film, but I can say that both communicate the same emotions I feel when I see or hear first-hand accounts about what's going on overseas. I'm not enraged or galvanized into either pro or con positions -- I'm simply depressed by the meandering, pointlessness of it all and the human waste.

The acting trio of Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson, as Foster's instructor in how to be a harbinger of death and especially Samantha Morton, as the widow of one of the dead with whom Foster strikes up a romance of sorts, are formidable, and the film feels authentic in its settings and in the people who populate them. If you had to label the film one way or another, you would definitely have to come down on the side of anti-war. But it's really too resigned and matter-of-fact for that label to fit, and that's what I like about it. It almost seems to be saying that being anti-war is beside the point. Wars are always going to exist, and to be opposed to them is a waste of time. What's most troubling to think about are the innumerable number of lives that are going to be snuffed out because of them.

In a film filled with terrific scenes, the one that haunts me most is the one set in Morton's kitchen where she tells Foster about the relationship she shared with her dead husband. Filmed as one long take, the scene is mesmerizing, and Morton is so good I can't imagine how she managed to go overlooked at end-of-year awards time.

I'm normally pretty hesitant about watching movies that have to do with war, but I'm glad that I chose to watch The Messenger. The movie took a completely different stance than what I'm used to when watching a movie about war. I never really thought about the people that had to deliver the message about a loved one that died in the military, and the way the story is told made me really care for the characters and feel for Harrelson's and Foster's characters and the important job that they have to perform. I would never want to have to do their job, but I truly respect the people that have to perform that job on a daily basis. 

Harrelson, Foster and Samantha Morton put on really powerful performances that I honestly believed. And the rest of the cast did a fine job, as well. The emotion was so intense that I could feel it, and I easily got sucked into the story. It was a powerful movie that really made me think about the hardships in a sincere and thoughtful way. Overall, I enjoyed the film and I will continue recommending it to all my friends because I think everybody should watch it at least once. The story sticks with you long after you finish watching the movie.

The Messenger is being overshadowed by other war films like The Hurt Locker, yet it is different and a great film. It has a very slow pace, but it has some incredibly powerful scenes and some amazing acting. Woody Harrelson is getting Oscar buzz for his performance, and he does deserve it. He has had a great year, with this and Zombieland. As great as he was, though, Ben Foster is just as great. Samantha Morton is probably better than both because she possesses a subtle and powerful gesture that only she has. I have only seen her in one other film, Synecdoche, New York, and she plays completely different types of personalities in both. Here, she is very quiet, but she is able to portray the reason why Foster's character is intrigued by her. The job that Stone and Montgomery (Foster and Harrelson) have is very difficult to do, and this is the first film to portray a job like that that I have seen. The director and writer did a great job. One of the flaws is that by the ending the film has no real directional focus, and this is a flaw in the screenplay. However, still a great film that should be seen not just for Harrelson but for the entire cast. Don't let the subject matter turn you away

Another gloomy drama depicting what life is like when back home in wartime; this movie features some really great acting performances and a subject that resonates every time very powerfully. The plot hasn't been developed too much, as the story feels more focused on the characters, on their moody and attitudes/emotions. It's about a remarkable direction relying very much on the introspective work of the lead actors. Ben Foster is terrific as a man permanently on the edge, Woody Harrelson excellent as well as one who's crossed the edge already. Impressive is also the approach to heroism, without ever simplifying it and with a strong attention to the story-telling detail. And even though the plot takes a couple of contrived turns, there's a subtle, observant film-making about what's going on inside the characters for a change.

The job of notifying next of kin by the Army Casualty Notification Unit is an extremely sensitive one. Such a job is not entrusted to just anyone in the militaryyou have to undergo significant training before you're assigned to such a specialized unit. That's why it's hard to believe that Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) would be thrust into the job when he only has three months of enlistment time left. What's more, would the Sergeant have been chosen since he's only recently come back from Iraq and may have been traumatized there? As for his training, his commanding officer, Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), merely throws a training manual in his lap and expects him to learn the job as they go along.

To confess, I'm a bit biased against movies such as 'The Messenger' because I find characters who like themselves to be vastly more compelling and believable than those who don't. In general, characters who don't like themselves are dull and rarely add to the dramatic flow of the narrative (can you imagine a sad-sack Tony Soprano ever capturing the public's imagination?). The strategy of the Messenger's scenarists is to start us off with the two angst-ridden soldiers, Montgomery and Stone, and eventually show how they redeem themselves by overcoming their depressing background and circumstances.

Montgomery is basically a putz who can't accept the fact that his former girlfriend has dumped him and is now engaged to someone else (how many sad-sack soldiers do you know who would actually show up at an ex-girlfriend's wedding intoxicated and wearing unwashed military fatigues?). The implication of course is that somehow, due to being traumatized in Iraq, he would end up acting that way. The contrived wedding scene is designed to show Montgomery at his lowest momentafter acting in such a boorish manner, he can now redeem himself by lending a helping hand to Olivia (Samantha Morton), the widow who he recently notified that her husband had been killed in action.

Similarly, Captain Stone also has self-esteem issues. On the surface, his by-the-book demeanor masks a deep self-hatred. This is manifested in his constant skirt-chasing and avoidance of any meaningful relationships with women. The basic question arises: would the Military actually have put someone like Captain Stone in charge of an army Casualty Notification Unit (i.e. someone so broken and negative?). I would suggest that such a negative character is a complete exaggeration anyway, designed merely to create dramatic scenarios where none would exist truly in reality. But even if such a character existed, he would probably be the last chosen by the military to head a Casualty Notification Unit.

It takes a good deal of time before the central conflict comes to a head between Stone and Montgomery. And that is basically Montgomery believes in being a little more sensitive when notifying the next of kin as opposed to Stone who wants to follow 'procedures'. That's about the essence of the conflict between the two principals and when they finally confront each other, it's not much of a payoff. The sub-plot involves Montgomery trying to start things up with Oliviahis decision to not make the moves on her is designed to show that he's a 'good guy' after all and through his efforts to help her, shows that he's attained a measure of redemption.

The Messenger also consists of various scenes in which the next of kin are notified of the deaths of their loved ones. Given the variety of the people we meet, it's probably the most interesting aspect of the film. Steve Buscemi's performance is probably the most notable (for better or worse) of these characters, where he strikes Montgomery after being notified about the death of his son, and later offers a rather predictable apology.

I've read that the men and women who perform the job of the Casualty Notification Units are dedicated, trained professionals who by the nature of their employment, must set an example by living lives of great integrity (unlike the two troubled malcontents in 'The Messenger'). The contrived characters of 'The Messenger' do nothing to enhance the reputation of these specialized units; rather, their opposition feels artificial, contrived, all part of a plot artifice that calls for the type of conflict one might expect to see in the movies but never in real life. While I have no doubt, 'The Messenger' was meticulously researched as to how these Notification units operate, it still feels like it was written by an outsider. 'The Messenger' might have gotten many of its 'facts' right, but unfortunately I could not believe I was watching a story about real people.

Ben Foster is officially a man, not a college kid or winged teenage mutant.

In THE MESSENGER he portrays a seriously wounded soldier who takes no consolation in having saved the lives of his men or surviving. He must still perform self-administered medical routines each day as a result of his injuries, he doesn't make miraculous recovery and he can't just "forget." With three months left in his stint, he is assigned to a notification detail under the command of a jaded and harsh soldier played by Woody Harrelson. It is their job to tell people their relative has been killed in war.

It is annoying that the angle of him overstepping bounds with a widow, because this has been done poorly in so many films. The fact that they become friends is far enough over the bounds for the soldier. This is a beautifully and sensitively handled situation that looks and sounds real, not contrived.

The responses from the people who are notified of their loss are too striking to be fake. I'll need to read more on development of this script, but I encourage you who see this movie to be prepared: it is touching and gripping in its rawness.

If you are the kind of film-goer who likes to be emotionally and cognitively challenged by film -- even if it's difficult -- this is a must-see.

I thought this an incredibly clumsy film where the two main characters didn't really seem to be part of any military organization, completely on their own when not doing their notification duty. 

The actual"notifications" seemed equally clumsy as if the director and screen writer hadn't bothered to determine the actual procedure (from a website): 

"I've been trained to do Casualty Assistance and Notification duties ... When the casualty affairs office receives notice of a death, they wait on positive identification, then they look at the soldier's records to find out who to notify. While this is going on, the Casualty Notification Officer (CNO) is informed that there was a death, and has to don the proper uniform (Class A) and go to the Casualty Affairs office for a briefing. Part of the briefing is to receive a statement containing the proper words to use to tell the primary next of kin (PNOK)..." 

Incredible that these two misfits would be entrusted with such a sensitive assignment and in the case of the Sargent, with no training whatsoever. There was no briefing re the KIA, just a beeper. And instead of a customized message, it was the same canned speech in every case.

The bonding of the officer and EM seems highly unusual, apparently both living off base which was never referred to.The Iraq veteran's health status was introduced but never resolved and the pair in fatigues crashing and being accepted/included in the Iraq vet's ex-girlfriend's engagement party seemed especially forced and unreal.

So, I go to IMDb and check the external reviews where every reviewer seems to have abandoned their critical faculties. Without exception, all are heaping high praise on it, I'm guessing eager to laud this "tribute" to the fallen and their families. I thought it was a very poor telling of a potentially great story.

"Where seldom is heard a discouraging word . . ." 

All the words in The Messenger are discouraging, a film about two soldiers who deliver the news of deaths to next of kin. Ben Foster as Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery and Woody Harrelson as Captain Tony Stone evoke the pathos and terror of the delivery, which no one could ever be prepared for or endure without pain.

Just as Kathryn Bigelow's Hurt Locker reduces the horror of the Iraq War to a manageable microcosm of the horror of IUD's with her study of a bomb squad, so too does director Oren Moverman take that war and crystallize it in the terrifying acts of delivering and receiving the Secretary of the Army's condolences. Never is there a light moment except when the two soldiers get drunk and sing Home on the Range, an ironic song of tranquility amidst chaos.

The dramatic moments of this memorable film are many because the premise should not be taken lightly or romanticized, like battle itself. The message of the film and its titular heroes is so desperately depressing that only superior actors such as Foster and Harrelson could make you feel at home on this range.

Oren Moverman's moving drama is one of the better Hollywood films to deal with the unpopular war in Iraq, and the damage inflicted on soldiers and their grieving families. Like Stop Loss and its ilk, the film depicts how soldiers return home psychologically scarred by their experiences in combat and have trouble adjusting to the normal routine of life back home. In some cases the only outlet they have for their anger and frustration is alcohol or brawling, or else they often withdraw inside themselves.

The Messenger is set against the backdrop of the Casualty Notification Team, the special unit whose soldiers are charged with informing families of the death of their loved ones in combat. They get to see families on the worst day of their life. Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) was wounded in Iraq and transferred home and temporarily assigned to the unit. He learns the ropes under veteran Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson). While Stone is able to remain detached from the suffering and grief he witnesses, Montgomery is not so sanguine. He feels for many of the families, and he becomes emotionally involved with a recent widow (Samantha Morton).

Moverman's direction is sympathetic and restrained, but the anti-war message comes across strongly. Moverman draws superb performances from his cast. In his Oscar nominated role Harrelson delivers his best performance, and manages to convey the complexities and depth of his character. Foster is a revelation in the biggest and most emotionally challenging role of his career to date. And Steve Buscemi also registers strongly in a rare serious role as a bereaved father.

An interesting, moving and thought provoking film, well worth checking out.

Life for Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) and Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) is not pretty. They have the unenviable job of being a part of the Army's Casualty Notification Service. In other words, they have to tell the soldier's next of kin that their loved one has died. As one can imagine, this is not an easy task to perform, and it isn't any easier for us to watch.

This is a wonderful film, but the first half hour or so is like Independent Film-making 101. It shows what they do in an understated way to add a gritty sense of realism, and then afterwards the characters spout their philosophies of life and what not over drinks (well, at least Will does. Tony's been in AA for three years). This part is well-acted, so it's somewhat effective. But if you've seen a lot of Oscar bait films over the past few years, it seems a little redundant.

Fortunately, the film takes off about at half hour in, when Olivia Patterson enters the picture. She's played by the always exceptional Samantha Morton, so if anything, this should be a great time to have the film take off in a new direction. Olivia may not be a central character, but her character leads to some interesting developments, and co-writer/director Oren Movermen takes advantage of the opportunity.

The performances in this film are nothing short of amazing. Ben Foster is probably one of the most versatile young actors out there these days. It's a shame that movies are filled with teen idols with no talent (i.e. Robert Pattinson, or any hunky actor aimed at the "Twilight" crowd) are brought to the big time, while guys who actually CAN act, like Foster, are left to struggle. Granted, actual "actors" probably have the good sense to stay away from crap like "Twilight," but you get my point. Whatever the reason, Ben Foster is incredible. He's a nice guy, a little softspoken, but we can feel his pain about the emotionally painful job that he has to do. Likewise, Woody Harrelson is exceptional as Tony. Harrelson is known for his off-the-wall comedy appearances that would be at home in a Farrelly Brothers movie (he starred in their film, "Kingpin"), but he gives his best performance to date as Stone. He's a tough as nails, by the book kind of soldier, but he's also very vulnerable, particularly because of his alcoholism, and probably because the job he has affects him more than he would ever admit, and he's touched by Will's humanity. Samantha Morton is fine in a supporting role, but this film is more about Will and Tony than anything, and her romance is not especially important anyway.

Oren Moverman adopts a low-key but emotionally attuned tone for his film, and I was reminded of another Iraq war film, "In the Valley of Elah." However, this film works because it solves the problem that Paul Haggis' film had. We feel for and understand Will and Tony in a way that we didn't for Hank Deerfield.

As one might imagine, this is not a happy film, and some scenes are particularly hard to watch. But for those who like good cinema and outstanding performances, "The Messenger" is not to be missed.

There has been a platoon full of bad Iraq war movies in the past few years, but it seems to be getting better. Kathryn Bigelow's "The Hurt Locker" took home the Academy Award for best picture for 2009, and "The Messenger" is just as engaging if not more so.

Directed by Oren Moverman, "The Messenger" is about least desirable job in the military, Casualty Notification Officer. Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson lead a pitch perfect cast in this intensely emotional film. Staff Sergeant William Montgomery (Foster) is back home recovering from a bomb blast when for the last three months of his service time he is assigned to a local Casualty Notification Team. It is Captain Tony Stone's (Harrelson) duty to show him the ropes. Stone, a Gulf War vet who never saw any real combat, is a recovering alcoholic and a very lonely man. He is like a hollowed out steel statue of a man, who has had to always keep a stern dignified face while delivering the worst news a family could possibly get. Sergeant Montgomery is a very skilled, very smart soldier but wonders how long he could last and against all protocol and judgment starts up a relationship with the widow of deceased soldier, played by Samantha Morton. This relationship is handled very well and like the rest of the film is grounded in reality.

The notification scenes are absolutely heart wrenching and feel as real as it gets. Director Moverman really did his homework on the material and wrote a fantastic script. He then surrounded himself with a group of the finest actors and craftsmen around and made a truly moving film. As for Woody Harrelson you kind of forget how good an actor he is. After last summers horror blockbuster "Zombieland" he proves time and again the kind of range he has. Then there is Ben Foster who has quietly built a reputation as one of the finest actors around with roles in big budget films and small independent films like this one.

The DVD has a 25 minute documentary about Casualty Notification Officer, a commentary track and a few other extras. A definite must see!

"We navigate", Capt. Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) instructs his new recruit on the Casualty Notification Team, Sgt. Will Montgomery (Ben Foster). But how does a shattered man begin to negotiate the grief of strangers, when he can barely fathom his own?

Oren Moverman's penetrating debut employs bare-bones camera-work and a subdued colour palette, putting the focus on the dialogue. Co-written by Moverman, the script is by turns singularly intimate and universal, compounded by stirring lead performances. A decorated soldier returning home from Iraq to convalesce from IED incurred shrapnel wounds, Will realises that the final three months of his tour will be the hardest. With the strategic aim of being the first to deliver the news, the two men come to rely on each other, eventually letting their emotions surface in an intensely moving relationship.

Stone is possessed of a wry, often unsavoury humour which assists in masking his own insecurities and handling the job at hand with the intended clinical etiquette. Will struggles to maintain a similar detachment, seeking comfort in recently widowed Olivia (Samantha Morton), who describes having lost her husband to a war which consumed him with 'rage and fear'. This resonates in Will's search for purpose and connection, and deliverance from the memories that haunt him. At times the articulation of emotion is unbearably raw, yet Moverman leaves us to draw our own conclusions - more is said about the casualties of war in Will's piercing, broken stare than in any regurgitated army spiel. 5 out of 5

Oren Moverman, who makes his directorial debut with 'The Messenger' touches new highs. There are some films, and Then there are some film, and then there is a film called 'The Messenger'! I am a unabashed cinema fan, and I can proudly say that I saw a Masterpiece in 'The Messenger'.

I am super-excited and in awe of 'The Messenger', it's such a powerful film, it's a such an engaging story. A story of two of "Messengers" and a "Widow' unfolds with flourish. Some films defy the word Flaw or Minus, and 'The Messenger' is one of those magical films. I am fan-club of this film, another community of liking.

Oren and Alessandro Camon's Screenplay is powerful and prolific. It's water-tight. Oren's direction deserves distinct marks, his works is amongst the best ever!! Alexander Hall's editing is perfect.

Coming to the acting department, Woody Harrelson stands tall in a role that won him wide acclaim. It's a legendary performance all the way! Ben Foster is magnificent. He's an actor who's sure to be known as a Show-Stopper in the coming time. Jena Malone is effective. Samantha Morton is excellent in a supporting role, she's so natural! Steve Buscemi is terrific in a cameo appearance.

'The Messenger' is a gift, a beautiful one. So, catch this well-decorated gorgeous gift right now! Reccmeneded to all!

US Army Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) is a hero severely injured in Iraq with only a few months left. He is reassigned as part of the Casualty Notification Team. He has an affair with his ex-girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone) who is engaged with somebody else. He is teamed up with Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) who treats his work seriously. They go to inform Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton) but she seems unconcerned. She intrigues Will who starts getting involved in her and her kid's lives.

These are interesting and compelling characters. The performances by Foster and Harrelson are terrific. There are some powerful moments especially some of the notifications. The main plot meanders a bit and feels a bit aimless. It's worthwhile to see the good performances.

This may be the toughest non-combat task in any army - announcing the families that their dearest ones, son or daughter, husband or wife fell on the line of duty in war. It needs to be done fast, as relatives should learn about the tragedy before the news show in the media, it needs to be done with dignity and sensitivity for the grief of the family, and rules, of course, rules need to be respected. However what rules are worth in such personal and painful moments? And how can the messengers, even if or especially because they are themselves people who have seen combat and faced death, their own and the one of their comrades, cope with this task? These are the key questions asked by The Messenger, a film with excellent premises which has as heroes a team of two of the uniformed soldiers the US army deploys home to pass to families the messages of death.

It's quite interesting that this American film about the consequences of the American wars for the people who fight and for the families left home was written by an Israeli and an Italian (Alessandro Camon) and directed by the Israeli - Oren Moverman. Or maybe it is not, at least on what Moverman is concerned. This story could have happened in Israel as well, where quite a number of families have to deal with the loss of their closer family or friends in wars or terror attacks, and where Memorial Day is one very special moment, felt and lived together by the whole nation. Quite amazingly the Israeli cinema has dealt very little until now with this subject, and Moverman, who lives in the US made the film there. The result is The Messenger - a very American and a very universal film at once, one of the most interesting made until now about and against the war in Iraq.

At no moment I had the feeling that this is the first long feature film directed by Moverman. As director he masters well the camera moves, alternating traditional and fluent scenes with hand-held camera giving the feeling of reality and passing to viewers the intense dramatic effects when the announcements are being made to the families. The team of actors does a fine job as well, with Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson up to the task of playing the two soldiers with their lives transformed forever by the war even if they survive it, and with Samantha Morton whose work I love every time I see her giving a strong and perfectly restrained performance as the fresh widow who tries to keep hope and make the life go on despite the terrible loss. The big problem of the film is that despite the excellent premises the story does not have enough dramatic tension, so the excellent first half creates expectations that are not well fulfilled in the second half. The story of the fight near the lake, or the incident at the wedding do not fit well and do not add too much to the evolution of the characters. Moreover, the discussions between the two members of the team become suddenly too verbose for people who up to then seemed to be much more used to action than words, and who looked like understanding situations and communicating just by gestures or expression of eyes. The feeling I was left at the end was that The Messenger has a story of big potential, but not fully realized.

After paying his dues with thankless supporting roles, Ben Foster finally gets to display his leading man chops. What fine chops they are too. Foster oozes confidence on the screen. His natural talent shines through. Here he plays a man given of the duty of informing soldier's next of kin of their demise. Teamed with Woody Harrelson, the pair visit a number of homes. Each one is like some new episode of a fascinating series of shorts. Each family deals with the grief in a different way. It's a great insight into that brief 10 second moment in life where everything changes. It's also hard to capture that gut-punching realization, something this film does very well. Towards the end the film wonders off, becoming a buddy road movie in the vain of Sideways. I felt the wedding scene was unnecessary, but as a whole this should be one of the strong contenders come award season.

Woody Harrelson is Captain Tony Stone, and he is assigned the thankless job of notifying next of kin of a loved ones death during military service in the Middle East. It is remarkable to see the transformation of an actor famous for playing a goof ball on Cheers, become one of the best leading men working today. He is given a new partner, Sergeant Will Montgomery(Ben Foster), a war hero, just back from combat in Iraq. 

The two make an interesting pair as they make the rounds, delivering bad news to mothers, fathers, sons and daughters of the fallen. The first thing Stone tells Montgomery is of the strict policy of no physical contact with the family members. Their encounters are heartbreaking and the emotional toll it takes on them is overwhelming. If this film doesn't make you cry, then you are seriously disturbed. The script is solid and Harrelson is magnificent as the Captain who must also battle demons of his own while carrying out a draining and endlessly challenging task. The Messenger is a moving and important tale of survival.

Though The Messenger shows no actual combat or scenes of fighting, it would seem to be in the vein of some of the anti-Vietnam movies of say, Oliver Stone and such, showing an alternative way how war messes people up.

The Messenger is also a largely unlikeable film, being also difficult to watch and now, to review. A messenger in this sense is someone who has to knock on next-of-kin's doors and inform them that their son/daughter has been killed in action. Reactions, unsurprisingly are mixed and unpredictable.

Naturally, this requires a special type of person to handle such and in military captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who's been decorated but also in A.A., we find a flawed and angry man. Taking on a younger new recruit, Staff Sgt Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) there's the obvious clash of experience and outlook and the even more inevitable buddy type of hanging out together.

Unfortunately for us, both men seem to like to resort to thrashing out heavy metal and punching the walls as a means of coping with the pent up frustrations that the job's rigid rules around emotion and self control insist upon. This makes it all jarring and unsettling, which may well have been what director Oran Moverman wanted. This is Moverman's first film and is reasonably accomplished.

There is some very welcome support from two of the world's finest character actors - Steve Buscemi and Brit Samantha Morton. They play father and wife, respectively of two entirely different men killed in Afghanistan and their characters feature big in the emotions of our two leads. Morton as widow, who Foster helps but fortunately (for both the film and us) does not get too emotionally involved, is probably the easiest role to both like and believe.

The Messenger is a well acted, reasonably well directed film but one that is also quite long. As I said, I didn't find it particularly enjoyable and as such, cannot personally readily extend to beyond 7/10.

"The Messenger" is an emotionally captivating story. From the very beginning, the look of the film makes you question what the movie is really about. A bit slow in the beginning, the movie begins to wrap you up in curiosity and then takes you out into the troubles of what it is like for a soldier to re-acclimate him/herself to society after a tour of duty; all while serving the last few months of service in the Casualty Notification Team. 

We follow the main characters journey back into society and get a first hand view at the parallels that are often overlooked by people who are not in direct contact with military personnel. The characters are charming, down to earth, and completely relatable. You don't have to have served in the military to understand the struggles, both internal and external, that our protagonist faces. The supporting cast does a great job of portraying everyday folks who could be anyone and everyone. The dialogue and story, combined with simple, yet artistic camera work, make this story truly enthralling. 

"The Messenger" is a great film that everyone should watch.
