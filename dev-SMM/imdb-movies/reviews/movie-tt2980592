### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
It's a bold statement but I stand by it. This movie had everything I wanted and a hell of a lot more. The plot in a nutshell is that a guy named David (Dan Stevens) goes to the house of a soldier who was KIA and claims to have known him personally, so the family invites him to stay. Then things start happening, secrets come out, and sh*t goes down. Simple premise, and if it sounds familiar it's probably because it's been done many times, but never quite with as much finesse as The Guest. 

The writer and director are the same team that brought us You're Next and a few segments from V/H/S and V/H/S/2. Personally I loved You're Next - it was a straight up horror comedy with little to no surprises. Here, the duo hone their strengths into their magnum opus so to speak. The Guest is an action thriller, but there are a lot more elements at work. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's intense, and it gets pretty frightening at times. The scope seems very wide but it all flows together without a hitch, and each emotional reaction keeps your eyes glued to the screen waiting for what happens next. 

The Guest is held together by its lead, Dan Stevens. I haven't seen him in anything before this but he was flawless in this role as an enigmatic, seemingly charming family friend. David is immensely likable, even when questionable things start happening you still want to root for the guy. He just has a badass aura around him. Dan Stevens plays him with such conviction that you can't see through him and you have no idea what is going on in his head, but you know that there's more to him than meets the eye.

When I say sh*t goes down in this movie, I mean it. Sh*t. Goes. Down. I won't spoil anything but The Guest has one of the most stylish, suspenseful, colorful, and downright invigorating third acts in a movie I've seen in a while. It's f*cking magnificent. Some people are split on this opinion but honestly, I thought it was an absolute blast. It takes place in a Halloween fun house; as soon as it began I turned into a giddy schoolgirl. Yeah, it's just that much fun. The first two acts are impeccable as well, building up the tension and suspense to a level of tangibility that you can cut with a knife. 

The characters surrounding David are all great as well. They're your typical family, and although it may seem like they're just caricatures, they are completely convincing in their roles largely due to the realistic dialogue. Everything progresses believably and exactly how you'd want it to, and the predictability is a strength in this case because it gives the filmmakers a chance to make the simple premise as shiny and creative as possible. I was not bored for a minute of this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal too - it has an '80s thriller vibe and a lot of dark electronic grooves similar to those in You're Next but even better.

The Guest is an action-thriller buff's wet dream, and it even throws in some horror for good measure. It really is one of the most underrated movies of 2014 and an experience that no thriller fan should miss out on.

I've never watched Downton Abbey, but I'm guessing that Dan Stevens deliberately sought out very different roles after leaving the show. The Guest is the perfect advert for his abilities. He's convincing as the mysterious but charming visitor and equally capable in moments of action, suspense or humour. I hope the right roles come along for him as he's entertaining to watch and has got everything required to become a major star.

The plot unfolds in a fashion that renders a summary both unnecessary and unwanted if you're planning to see this, but after the initial set-up it progresses at a decent pace and with escalating tension.

A special mention is required for the soundtrack. The electronic score is one of the film's major strengths and is perfectly judged.

An entertaining and self-aware mix of action, suspense and dark humour, the Guest has a retro feel without being old fashioned (a quality that is encapsulated by the score), and features decent performances.

I thought Wingard's last effort You're Next suffered from too much hype and it didn't entirely work for me. Now he returns with an action movie of sorts with some slasher elements thrown in with The Guest and this is a home run. It is a slick and entertaining action thriller that hearkens back to the same kind of movies from the 80's with its own modern touches along with a great soundtrack and a great performance from Dan Stevens.

Good: Dan Stevens is the glue that binds this movie together. He exudes vulnerability and charm that you just can't help but like the guy and yet he still retains some sinister vibes underneath that smiling exterior. He knocks it out of the park and when things amp up he delivers on that front also. I really like the family in this movie. They were all likable and I was concerned for their well being which isn't something that a lot of these movies tend to successfully pull of. Maika Monroe turns in a strong performance. The direction is very slick and it has a nice atmosphere to it. The action is swift and hits hard without going too over the top. The music is another plus with its 80's style synth pop that makes every scene that much more enjoyable.

Bad: The movie never truly surprises with its twists and turns and it is a pretty straightforward thriller.

Overall, it doesn't do anything new, but it does so in style with great performances, slick action, and an awesome soundtrack.

I went in to the cinema with no expectations with this movie. I watched the trailer and assumed it will be some average movie but I was totally mistaken. The film is very fast paced with surprisingly some humor throughout. There was a lot of gruesome fight scenes (I personally jump watching violent scenes) but I get the reasons why they were there. Dan Stevens was a complete shocker with his performance. If you remember him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! He portrays a brilliant character and he does an amazing American accent. All the actors were perfectly cast for this movie. I loved Maika Monroe, she reminded me a lot of Brittany Murphy and Gwen Stefani. The ending was totally not expected and I loved every bit. The music played reminded me a bit of Drive soundtrack but worked brilliant with this movie. I truly recommend the movie!!

While the second half is forgettable action fun. A very uneven movie, which raises enormous expectations in those first 40 minutes, but ultimately can't deliver. We, the viewer, are still left with half of a marvelous movie. The main actor is incredible. Not in the Pacino sense, but more in the Schwarzenegger sense. He creates an iconic character, which is extremely sympathetic and scary at the same time. The writing has some obvious plotting issues, but all the way through you'll come across terrifically written scenes. The direction and overall acting is top notch. But to me, the greatest thing about the film ia its use of music. It has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for a long time. Think Miami Vice crossed with Brad Fiedel's work on the The Terminator. Really effective stuff.

Like I said, the second half is forgettable and formulaic, but still fun.

It feels almost inaccurate to refer to this movie as The Guest when in reality it was entirely carried by a wonderful performance by Dan Stevens. I enjoyed it thoroughly, which isn't at all to say it's what I would normally call a good movie. The movie is highly campy, reminiscent of '80s-'90s action movies / thrillers, and Dan Stevens brings in an excellent all around tongue in cheek tough 80's anti-hero performance. 

Stevens' acting is well matched by strong action that is to the point and not drawn out, as well as superbly chosen music, particularly in the climactic scenes. 

For any gamers out there, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for the nostalgia and humor, you'll likely love this movie as much as I did.

The only thing surprising in The Guest is just how straight forward it is in its simple plotting. Everything unfolds in predictable fashion, but this B material is a fantastic showcase of wicked humor and misanthropic violence. Dan Stevens is in excellent form here, as a mysterious soldier who shows up unannounced at a family's home of a fallen soldier he served with. He's all smiles and very polite, but people with a usually negative connection with this family start meeting grisly ends. Like in his previous film You're Next, Adam Wingard approaches plotting you've seen a million times and wittily turns it on its ear without ever being too self aware. It's a shame Picturehouse who acquired the US rights dumped the film in a handful of theaters without trying to capitalize on the strong reviews and never bothered to expand it theatrically. The Guest is a quick fun time that knows exactly what it is and delivers without overstaying its welcome.

So a guy who claims to know your dead son turns up at your house one day. He seems nice and looks like that bloke off of Downton so you let him stay for a while... That is pretty much all I knew about this film before I went to see it. What follows is an enjoyable thriller with laughs aplenty and an excellent central performance from Dan Stevens (more on that later).

The plot, at the end of the day, is fairly nonsensical and there are some troubling loose ends that I found a little unsatisfactory. I can't say that any of the story is particularly surprising or original but what does that matter when everyone making it and everyone in the audience seems to be having so much fun? The cinema I was in was probably around half full and while there was nobody in full-on hysterical laughter, there was a satisfactory amount of appreciative chuckling (me included).

I feel that the majority of my enjoyment of this film should really be credited to Dan Stevens in the main role. His character is charming, pleasant and helpful and yet strangely sinister and unsettling from the outset and he plays it absolutely perfectly. You can't help but like him even though you're not sure that you should. Apart from a smallish role in "The Fifth Estate", I am only familiar with Stevens from Downton Abbey and his role in this couldn't have been more different from both of these. I look forward to seeing how his career progresses but this was an excellent example of his versatility as an actor.

Overall a good Saturday night out at the cinema but I can't imagine it is the kind of classic film I would watch again and again.

The acting is great, the soundtrack fantastic and the atmosphere the movie creates sucks you in from the very beginning. The movie keeps you guessing throughout at least for the first hour or so. You KNOW something is off but you have no idea what exactly. When I watched it my theory of what was going on changed every 10 minutes :D As the last reviewer stated the first hour is definitely the best part. Unfortunately towards the end the writers kind of dropped the ball. The ending is somewhat unsatisfactorily predictable and the story can only go the way it goes because of absolutely ridiculous mistakes made by some of the characters. I don't know why most movies foam in the endings but I guess in this case it is something that I'm very willing to endure for the fun I had during the first 2/3 of the film.

The acting is awesome for the most part. Dan Stevens does a great job keeping you on the edge the whole time which is utterly entertaining. The writing and dialogue are great except as mentioned above for the somewhat disappointing ending. But all in all this movie stuck with me and though it has been a couple of days since I watched it I still "feel" the atmosphere it created (to a great extend due to its unconventional soundtrack, which I eventually bought although it is generally not my kind of music at all). This is a very good movie and I am a little surprised that I basically had to stumble over it by accident and it hasn't gotten more publicity. If the ending had been a little different it could have been fantastic, none the less this way it is still great.

Creepy stranger premise has been used in horror or mystery to varied effect, the latest Jennifer Lopez's flick is an example of how not to welcome this premise. Luckily, The Guest has the luxury of having suave lead actor and good atmosphere for a thriller. Some of the kinks are predictable, but the dark humor as well as bizarre revelations offer much needed novelty to the movie.

David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son. He's well-mannered and seems trustworthy, thus the family welcomes him openly. Upon his stay, strange accidents begin to happen, and suspicion arises with the casualties. The most important hook is Dan Stevens' portrayal of David. He looks like a rugged debonair, this is not average smooth, this is Ryan Gosling's level of smoothness.

Stevens delivers a wide variety of emotions, he can be either friendly or deadly. Backed by good cast, such as Maika Monroe as the Anna Peterson and Lance Reddick as Mayor Carver, the movie has a solid degree on acting performance. The exchange of banter is enjoyable, often resulting in manipulation or downright violence for David's benefit. It elevates the human drama between him, the Peterson family and whoever unlucky enough to be in their immediately vicinity.

Mystery of David's real identity is crafted slowly and it's compelling enough to pique interest without revealing too much. The film also has a touch of humor, albeit slightly crude. Strangely, in the third act it changes tone drastically for the climax. This shift is a bit odd considering it plays the thriller aspect with steady pace for the majority of early parts, although this explosive tone does have the merit of being entertaining.

There are short bursts of Hollywood style carnage, but they are modest, not all out gunblazing from the start like Bourne or the recent John Wick. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact.. Good practical effect for the blood and explosion as well as its highly unorthodox soundtracks make the faster pace scenes more satisfying.

Having good mesh of action, mystery and comedy, The Guest is enigmatically fascinating.

Imagine an episode of something as nuanced, understated and gripping as an episode of Homeland gradually turning into something as darkly humorous and comic book-esque as an episode of Dexter. Throw in some action set pieces and I think you would not be far away from what this is.

It starts out well. A mysterious man turns up at the house of his slain comrade and offers touching words to his family, winning them into his confidence one by one, though, in truth, their grief makes them easy prey. It continues to build well when he sorts out the son's high school tormentors in a way that will have you cheering. At this stage, his cover story that he cares about the family is still plausible, but he is clearly someone with the capacity for extreme violence. The acting is uniformly excellent.

However, in a bid to procure a large amount of firearms, he murders the arms dealer he is buying them from. The body count then starts to build implausibly quickly when the man who is standing in the way of the father of the family's promotion is also found conveniently dead.

The actors are excellent, as I say, but even they seem progressively unconvinced by the story when some covert government unit turns up to claim The Guest. Apparently he was part of some kind of experiment which went wrong, but details on this are very sparse.

The finale is camped up in the extreme and in the style more of an 80s B Movie. Which would make sense if the first half was anything close to that type of film, but instead you are just left scratching your head.

There are good moments, the acting is great, but don't be suckered in by the high ratings. This is not essential viewing. If you want a popcorn flick on a Saturday night this is okay, I guess, but that's all.

I can not believe this got such a high rating It was so pathetic and predictable. In the beginning it was tolerable to watch, then it became so predictable it was annoying. Then it just got to be in one word "DISAPPOINTING" Typical US rubbish of one side can shoot and kill from any position and the other cant shoot a barn door from 1 foot away.

In the end it leaves the option open for a follow up movie after he gets shot stabbed in the back and stabbed in the heart but manages to walk away at the end dressed as Fire fighter.

I am truly sorry but the previous reviewers must have never watched a decent thriller movie before "EVER".

This movie clearly has a small budget and is casted with no name actors we barely recognize except for the "David" character which apparently used to be on Downtown Abbey, a very popular show I refused to watch.

The movie starts out as unrealistically as you can imagine. A naive middle Americana family just allows this total stranger to stay at their house for as long as he likes because he served with their deceased son in the military and the photo in their living room proved it.

Without safety precautions or logical common sense both parents basically allows this complete stranger free reign over their home, kids, and even allows him to drive their car and mentor their troubled son. The only person with enough common sense to check on David's back story is the 20 year old daughter whose single phone call to the military checking up on him unravels a series of events that makes for one of the better action b-movies I've seen in a long time.

Yes, it's low budget, predictable, and corny, but it's very exciting, bloody, heart pumping and satisfies your guiltiest B movie pleasures.

The Guest is a film brought to you by Adem Wingard and Simon Barrett, the director and writer of You're Next and some of the segments of the anthology series V/H/S. Because I haven't seen one of these movies i had no clue what to expect. 

In this movie a "guest" shows up on the doorstep of a family who lost their son during a war. Because our guest fought with him on the battlefield he is invited to stay with the family for a while. And you might guess it, a lot of weird stuff starts to happen. It's a simple premise and one of my worst plot synopsis' i've written so far but i feel that it wouldn't be right to spoil too much of the story. 

I can honestly say that The Guest was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. I saw this movie without even having a clue and it was widely entertaining for a bunch of reasons. 

The aspect that differentiates The Guest from similar attempts is its soundtrack and how the filmmakers gave the soundtrack an importance equal to the main characters. It has that gritty 80s feel all over it that sets the tone for this movie from beginning to end. 

Dan Stevens as "the guest" is fantastic and this role really shows off his range as an actor. He infiltrates this family in every single way and the filmmakers did a really good job of keeping tension and having you wonder for a long time who this guy really is. Much of this is thanks to the performance of Stevens. In a way he's a very likable lead, even when things start to get weird you keep rooting for him. He plays "the guest" with so much conviction it's hard to tell what is going on in his mind but one thing is certain, you don't want him in your house for too long. 

In conclusion The Guest is a great action-horror hybrid from the 80s that's influenced by it in the best possible way. You can tell that these guys have respect for 80s action-horror but also know how to transcend it in to a good movie with a lot of style and tension build in to it.

An old idea nicely redone with top notch writing and direction.

This is a breakout role for Dan Stevens who manages to commit horrible acts while at the same time being pleasant courteous and generally the kind of guy you'd be happy to have as your friend.

In fact, this is one of those rare movies where the viewer has more fun if you root for the bad guy (so to speak) right from the opening scene.

Hard to find fault with. Even the action scenes are done with the sort of precision you would expect from a martial arts movie.

For perfectionists only -- at 1:17 in the movie, there is an outrageous plot hole. While everyone, including the killer, is going to extremes to keep secret the government project that started this mess, a secret government agent agent suddenly spills the beans to a young girl for no reason at all other than to provide backstory.

Overlook that, and this is a fun flick.

Wow! What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.

What follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!

A special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!

Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!

I've watched the guest in the past day or so 3 times its the definition of fun, I did see it in the cinemas back in September but had mixed feelings, but here's the thing i couldn't stop thinking about it it got me thinking and talking that is a good thing. And I got it early on blu ray so ha that's how I watched it in the past few days. 

Dan Stevens is incredible in this he pulls of a creepy and scary performance while being a handsome man he pulls this role off so well I can't think of anyone else In this role. 

This film is a dark comedy which some people writing these reviews fail to understand, that's what makes me laugh almost as much as the actual film, how can you take a film about a guy who can take about 3 stab wounds to the chest seriously is beyond me. And plus watch the interviews with Wingard and Stevens it's intentional. 

Sheila Kelly is dreadful and is the weakest part about the movie besides her everyone else is pretty good. 

I can watch the guest 6 more times today it's that fun. Watch it but know it's an intentional Dark comedy.

OK, I gave it a few hours before I posted this because I thought I might have missed something. Maybe it is like Pulp Fiction where it seems like a disjointed mess, but when someone tells you the key suddenly it slots together and makes sense. But it isn't. It is just a confused mess. 

It does homage some 80's movie styling, right from the opening credits there is a hint of something between Halloween and the Wraith. The music is good. 

But then the holes are huge. The story doesn't make sense! He turns up and they just take him in. Once the daughter figures out he is a fake everyone just ignores it. It turns out he is 'just' some random psychopath but part of his problem is that he kills anyone that knows who he is? Half a dozen trained soldiers turn up but are completely incompetent to the point that my girlfriend was complaining about their lack of basic soldiering skills. 

And what was with the weird tilting guns when turning corners thing that they were all doing?

And of course he survives at the end and none of them can count to three when removing the bodies? Really?!

The Guest just might be the 'coolest' movie of the year, it certainly features one of the coolest characters of the year, David. The movie has style to spare, from the vibrant lighting, to the retro soundtrack, the movie is easy on the eyes and ears, it's flat out amazing. The soundtrack being the high-point of the film, an a ray of synthesized songs that makes the movie something special. All the technical aspects of the film are more than covered, they are the highlight of the film, and the acting coming from Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe is great. 

The story revolves around the cryptic character, David, who stays with the family of a fallen soldier and subtly begins imposing his will on their lives. It's great to see the director know how to handle the material and shift the viewer's opinion of David back and forth, he's shown as the coolest guy at the party, he can do anything and everything, but at the same time you are shown darker glimpses of him that create some type of doubt. It's this doubt that carries the movie along, at first David is the saving grace of the family, he's solving their problems one at a time, but then things slowly start to change for the worse.

Is he who he says he is, is he really there to help, did he really serve with their son/brother, is all of this too good to be true? All these questions remain hidden until the end and rather than take the conventional route with this type of story, the movie takes a somewhat bizarre turn as it reveals what David's motives are and who he is. Though I can imagine some people might have a problem with how light the movie is with the details of who he is, I certainly had no problem with it whatsoever. 

I loved just about every single minute in the movie, other than the mother who takes open arms to new heights, this is how low budget thrillers should be. As I said above, the retro soundtrack and directing style coming from Adam Wingard is nothing short of spectacular. This is one of the best hidden gems of the year and sure to gain a very solid cult following as the years go by!

I had put off seeing this film for quite a while, mainly because i just didn't know what to expect. And after watching it, let me just say that i cannot believe that i didn't see this earlier. I had been hearing mixed reviews about this film so i didn't expect too much, but this film blew me away and was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. I cannot believe this film got so overlooked last year as it deserved a lot more attention than it got, it is one of the most underrated movies of last year. This movie was just so mesmerising and compelling from start to finish that i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. That was a result of the combination of great directing, and amazing soundtrack and a killer performance by Dan Stevens who i can see getting more larger roles in the future after this performance. His performance reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal's in Nightcrawler. Although not as good as Gyllenhaal's, he still managed to be such a presence while on the screen, he really transforms into the character and makes you convinced that he is a real guy. 

This film was also so well directed that i did not lose interest at any point during the film, the director did a great job at creating an overall tone and mysterious feel to the movie that just made it so compelling to watch. And the film was accompanied by what may be one of my favourite soundtracks of 2014, the music fit so well with the tone and the events that were happening on screen that you completely lose all sense of your surroundings and cannot look away from the screen, it just draws you in to the film. Where i felt the film could have excelled a little was having a little more action, there was a diner scene that was just awesome and you couldn't have gone wrong with a little more of that. I also thought the ending wasn't all that great, it definitely had a slightly emotional fell to it but if done differently i may have rated this a little higher. - 9

From Adam Wingard, the director of You're Next and V/H/S 2 comes another stylish thriller film that's just as darkly twisted as his previous work. The film is slowly building up its tension to a disturbing and suspenseful final with violently badass actions, solid performance, well chosen music, up to a smartly twisted climax. The film gets bloody as it goes with nothing gross or GORY but rather more disturbing and will probably SCARE you the next time you let some stranger into your house. Overall, this film again sets a bright future for director Adam Wingard and fans of his will not be disappointed with this FUN little old-fashioned and well-crafted film that really brings a fresh air into the thriller genre.

Going in, I expected 2014's "The Guest" to be the typical story of a mysterious stranger who turns out to be a psycho. Instead, I got a film that went for something a little different and in the process, paid tribute to the 80's slasher flicks themselves. The story begins when the mysterious but kindly David (Dan Stevens) knocks on the door of Laura Peterson, who just lost her son in the war, and claims to have known and served with him as a former soldier. Soon Laura and her family come to regard David as a member of the family. David seems like the perfect friend, he starts teaching one of the kids, Luke, how to not take crap from anyone and also starts hanging out with the Peterson's daughter, Anna (Maika Monroe), who works at the local diner and hangs out with her friends at parties like many teens do. But of course we the audience know that underneath the charm and ah shucks veneer, there's something to be afraid of and it's not long before several people in town start turning up dead. Who is David? Did he really he know the Petersons' son? And what does a covert military unit want with him?

Part of the fun of "The Guest" is where the story ultimately takes us. Without going into too much detail, let me just say David is far more dangerous than your average killer and despite this being a low budget flick, we the audience don't doubt it. Much of this should be attributed to Dan Steven's portrayal of the character. With his charm and good manners, Stevens is able to put you at ease one minute and then make the hair on the back of your neck stand up when we see him stare off at nothing but intensely enough to melt butter whenever he's alone in his room. Plus, he does a pretty good job convincing us he can handle himself in a fight. Maika Monroe plays her part of the hot daughter who has a thing for 80's sounding synth pop and a good sense of suspicion of David admirably as well, as does everyone else in the cast, such as Lance Reddick as the covert military operative sent to take David down. But above all, "The Guest" is memorable because we the audience get the sense there's something different here than your average low-budget thriller. One gets a feeling there's some sort of, I guess you could say nostalgic feel to the 80's in the film especially (strangely enough) "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" due to the plot and also the awesome 80's/early 90's sounding synth-pop, dance soundtrack the film has. Plus, the film takes place during Halloween which kind of adds to the film a little bit as well. I can't say it's a perfect film, but for what it is, if you're looking for something that's a little different to kill time with, "The Guest" is an awesome thing to do it with. Also starring Brenden Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser and Tabatha Shaun.

i have already full in love with this movie a lot, this is my top thriller since i am Action Martial Arts Fan i do like Sometimes different movies Horror,Comedy,Thriller,Gangster movies. this was my another top thriller films New Age 80's Style Movies" like Drive (2011) and Cold In July (2014)i loved the 80s style to me i thought it was horror movie like serial killer like Halloween but i don't know why people say it's mixed with Terminator, John Carpenter Halloween but i didn't care what people say about this movie i loved it i am huge fan of 80s 90's style.

(Dan Stevens)David Collins was friend Caleb who died in War Afghanistan come to Caleb house to his family mother Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) was mother and father Spencer Peterson (Leland Orser) i liked Cast i don't mind all fine i didn't care or have any problems with anyone, they did a very good job (Maika Monroe)one of my favorite actress Anna was daughter was my 2nd favorite character in film and Brother (Brendan Meyer) Luke Peterson. that's the all family that David Meet, i thought David was a very smooth very smart very charming, he treats everyone very well in family.Action Scenes were fantastic when he beats the crap of bully's in bar David Character i would say he's got evil Jason Bourne taking evil Jason Bourne but i am going with 80's slasher style Action scenes were good no shaky cameras, 80s style Dan Stevens got GREAT Performances in film. he was really good i liked him in Walk Among Of Tombstones (2014)Liam Nesson i love all action scenes was good blood and gore were so awesome. really good actor sold performance in film Dan Stevens got Shape like Michael Myers in Halloween school but the ending kinda got me upset just keeps you waiting until what happens next ? but i don't wanna spoil movie for everyone else. everyone say's where Guest 2 ? i guess there won't be Sequel i just got very curious. director had great idea was a great stand alone just like (Drive) 2011 Ryan Gosling.meaning you don't what's going to happen next. The soundtrack made the movie more than it could have been otherwise.

Maika Monroe playing a waitress and even has a similar outfit to Sarah Connor. Apparently Dan Stevens was made to watch the first 2 Terminator films back to back before filming for the Guest. So yeah absolutely, the creator is clearly a big Terminator fan. i am 80s Action fan until today i find my favorite thriller movie The Guest just sold greatest performance i wish this movie would come out Cinemas I hope they make a second one Dan Stevens had style like Ryan Gosling, Luke Evans the way he acts and he is very smooth character,actor soundtrack I the music is great reminding of the movie Drive (2011),Cold in July (2014) you have that same feeling watching those 3 i had watching. Such an exciting film, I never wanted it to end. But, as much as i enjoyed the film. No sequel, it's already as good as it gets, instant classic. 10.10 i Want Dan Stevens to do more movies like this, get more roles like this 80's style The whole the guy you trust is not who you thinks he is type of movie. Sounds like the lead delivers a great performance but that alone feels like it is main reason why the film stands out from the rest and is let alone worth a watch. I will check it out sometime for the performance by Dan Stevens, and for the score. But this does sound like a 10.10 worthy flick at all to me. T-1000 should be Dan Stevens because they said they can't find guy like Robert Patrick for 1-1000 but they find Asian guy for T-1000 but they can't find Asian guy for Teenage Mutant Turtles for master splinter ? but this is right guy for T-1000 Dan Stevens should be cast, everyone said it's crossover Terminator to Bourne Identity then he should be Villain for Terminator apart from getting lee byung Hun and Jason clarke..

This is my first review and the only reason i'm writing this is because all the good reviews made me watch this horrible movie. I'm gonna be short and reply to the other reviews. -this ain't a thriller -this ain't a horror -there is no action -this ain't the movie of the year -this ain't the best thriller in the last decade -this IS a comedy. I LMAO'd on how bad this movie is.

Acting is baaaaaad. When the kids find out their parents are dead, they like omg the school burned and i had a pair of sneakers i like in there. Those "soldiers" had never in their life a gun in their hands nor they saw someone holding one, not even on TV. I could write for an hour about how bad this move is but i must stop now, ITS NOT WORTH THE TIME.
