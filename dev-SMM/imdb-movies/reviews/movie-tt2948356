A Terrific Movie From The Great Walt Disney Pictures.

In The World Of Zootopia,all kinds of animals live in peaceful harmony.

There is no kind of racism or violence:" It is a perfect world where love,equality and peace of mind rule".

It is true that peace can never happen in any place in the world if there is oppression,racism,inequality and discrimination.

Walt Disney Pictures clearly delivers a useful moral of love,unity,integrity and peace of mind.

This Top movie also stresses on the fact that drugs are harmful.

Zootopia tells the story of a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Goodwin) who wants to be the first rabbit cop, so she joins the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department).

The smart and cute female rabbit plans to achieve justice in Zootopia.

This masterpiece movie is highly recommended for all kids and for every adult individual in the world who seek justice,freedom and peace of mind.

Honestly Speaking ZOOTOPIA IS INDEED A TERRIFIC WALT Disney MOVIE.

A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.

She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.

Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.

From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.

Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.

Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care.

The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.

The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message.

On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended.

In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia. However, upon arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox.

Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter, arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband Â– one of many animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation.

After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate Manchas, who mentions "night howlers" were responsible for attacking him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal, believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a fox.

Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence "night howlers". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr. Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart.

Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and argues they have gone back to their "natural state." Wilde is hurt and angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns. During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.

Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that "night howlers" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them.

Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy.

Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.

"Zootopia" is simply the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect.

A female bunny Judy Hopps faces discrimination from other prejudiced and bigoted animals who made fun of her size and could not believe her strong determination to be a cop.

since Judy is brainy and has a strong will to be a successful cop,she made a deal with a sly fox to get what she wants.

When the genius and the yummy bunny Judy became a policewoman,she was so just and confident in dealing with other animals and soon she receives all the estimation from all the animals including the previously prejudiced animals who underestimated it.

I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and lots of social references. Very good stuff.

Plot: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.

This was a film that I was hoping would be good, since most trailers can trick you these days but this film surpassed my expectations. Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.

Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.

From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a mammal metropolis where various animals live and thrive. When Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law. Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder.

I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The World Without Any Exaggeration.

Since This Movie is The Production Of Disney,it has to be perfect.

I love the movie. It is funny, it has a great story and the acting is excellent.

This definitely is one of the best, if not the best, animated movies of 2016 (together with Moana).

'There is no a perfect place, real life is messy and we all have limitations' - so very true especially now. We need to try to understand each other and 'try to make the world a better place.'

The movie basically says 'be the change you want to see in the world.' It is especially true nowadays, with a lot of conflicts and disagreements. I believe we should all try a bit harder, be a bit more understanding and try to change the world a better place.

I enjoyed this movie far more than i expected to.

Things i liked.

The relationship between judy hopps and nick wilde was really special and i enjoyed watching their interaction and growing friendship, they are both as heroic and smart as one another and although judy is this adventurous and outgoing go getter type of character for a few brief scenes she also had an emotional side i think it was delivered with great balance. I take zero pleasure admitting tears were in my eyes throughout this movie.

The humour although present throughout was never shoved down your throat which lead to a nice upbeat and colourful atmosphere and that's not to mention all the great design decisions behind the world created here. For example Ergonomics with giraffes in mind e.g a funnel to deliver a drink from ground level to giraffe height and small doors for mice. People should watch this movie for the world alone.

I could continue to shower this gem with praise but instead i'll list the things that bothered me about this film, the first thing is that the film was too short like no really i wish this film lasted an hour or so longer, the plot seems incredibly rushed at the end i never saw the plot twist coming and didn't predict the direction the film would go down but i feel it's because the culprit behind it all has come and gone within 5 minutes is arrested there's no build up or tension in the uncovering of the secrets behind the commotion which is a shame. I also feel like the chief of police was a relatively poor character and most of the characters in the film could do with more fleshing out.

All things said and done go watch this it is great.

Zootopia is another attempt to propagandize for multiculturalism, coming from the same studio which once produced an uplifting allegory for traditional white identity and aristocracy. In line with the dominant elite view on race, it manages to simultaneously push wild-eyed optimism and a paranoid victim attitude. Considering that it met with very positive critical response, including praise for its political message, the subtitle might as well be This is What Our Elites Actually Believe.

As the title implies, the film depicts an unrealistic society inhabited by various animals. The heroine, Judy Hopps, is an effervescent rabbit from a rural area whose parents hope that she will become a carrot farmer like themselves. Their bluntly stated and cartoonish view is that you should not try new things because you might fail. Rejecting this view, Judy aspires to be a police officer, unmoved by their insistence that no bunny has ever held that title. A fox bully assaults her and tells her again of the mismatch between her species and her career aspirations, but she ignores this as well.

The multicult message continues when Judy gets ready to leave for Zootopia to begin her law enforcement career. Her parents display excessive concern over her possible future encounters with foxes, offering her fox repellent and even a taser to defend herself with. They remind her of her experience with the fox Gideon Grey who assaulted her years ago, but our heroine recites lines to the effect of "NAXALT" and "some of us are jerks too."

Nick then recounts how he consciously decided that if others saw him as untrustworthy, he might as well act that way. Now an adult, he had bragged earlier in the film that he had been running scams every day since the age of 12. There was no mention of previous antisocial tendencies. The accusation that others' rejection can turn an otherwise respectable person into a professional lowlife is of course paranoid, but familiar to anyone who has heard the terms "marginalized" or "stereotype threat." The fox serves as an expression of the external locus of control so common among dysfunctional people.

Blaming external racist forces for degeneracy in one's own group should be a familiar concept to American viewers. This plot point is reminiscent of conspiracy theories about the CIA inventing and/or distributing crack cocaine to keep the Black man down, or similar popular theories concerning HIV. The seminal 1944 title An American Dilemma by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal accused White prejudices of encouraging low standards of morality among Blacks, which in turn reinforced White prejudices, and so on in a vicious cycle.

Of course, today even the implication that there are different standards of morality between races or nationalities would be dismissed as racist. Other than of the victims of the conspiracy, there is no mention in the film of any actual difference in values or behavior between contemporary predators and prey animals.

However, the differences between species in Zootopia are dramatic, not only in size and shape but in some aspects of behavior. The sloths who form the staff of the DMV are as slow as actual sloths, even in their speech. There is no pretense of equality in this context; Nick even sarcastically asks Judy if she thinks that someone must be slow just because he is a sloth. Integration of sloths into rabbit or sheep classrooms would obviously be absurd.

The film's denunciation of racism is partly based on attempts at humor, which is an appropriate choice for propaganda. Judy praises Nick as "articulate" and he responds by complimenting her on how "non-patronizing" she is, highlighting her "racism." Nick touches the sheep assistant mayor's wool without her knowledge, comically amused by how fluffy it is. Judy reprimands him to the effect that "you can't just touch a sheep's wool." She makes another reference to the racial sensitivities of American Blacks when she explains that a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when another animal does it, it is offensive.

The portrayal of "racist" characters is not as vitriolic as social justice warriors might like, but of course still fits with the overall agenda. While some "prejudiced" characters such as the elephant storekeeper and the young Gideon Gray are portrayed as hostile, the racist parents are portrayed as earnest and good-natured yet ignorant. Judy is to some degree portrayed the same way, when she innocently suggests that the basis of the predators going savage might be something in their biology. The results are not harmless though, as she triggers a wave of "xenophobia" against predators. Nick makes a great show of being offended by her racist thoughts, even testing her to confirm that she is in fact afraid of him, and she resigns in shame.

Zootopia makes a weak attempt at being less than utopian; Judy's original expectations of a city where everyone gets along are shown to be overly optimistic, which she ultimately admits in a voice-over at the end of the film. The attempts at justifying continued faith in multiculturalism come off as desperate, though. Judy recites slogans such as "real life's a bit more complicated than a slogan," adding that the "glass is half full" and "we all have a lot in common," but she does not sound as though she actually believes it. Of course, no one ever presents any particular reason to believe it; those who do not are simply not presented as reliable sources.

The film ends with a scantily clad gazelle performing a degenerate pop song by the Colombian singer Shakira which further highlights the underlying mindset. The lyrics of "Try Everything" celebrate mindless optimism and seem to be intended as a cheap form of therapy for someone who has a crippling fear of failure, reassuring them that "nobody learns without getting it wrong" and "sometimes we come last but we did our best."

This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things.

First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase.

As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these "lessons" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who "work hard" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses.

In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with "lessons" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.

Walt Disney has always conjured up magic for us, and Zootopia is the latest offering to continue the trend. An absolute treat for youngsters and older viewers, it's funny, it's moving, full of hidden messages, just a genuinely magical film.

Beautiful animation as you'd expect, the voice overs fitted the film beautifully, and the soundtrack is uplifting and wonderfully in keeping with the tone of the movie. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are utterly incredible, as is Idris Elba, a role I never thought I'd see him doing.

Mr Big was without a doubt my favourite character, the Marlon Brando thing he had going on was hilarious.

It's rare to find a movie that fails in one category but pulls itself up in another, only to cycle through this pattern many times over. Zootopia feels like it's trying to pull itself up until it adds another plot point into the film.

So my main issue with the movie is that it ties up it's plot-points too quickly near the end. Like, it resolves the mystery, Weaselton, Mr. Big, and Nick and Judy hating each other in about 10 minutes.

The action scenes were all good, the train scene being a genius scene. The issue is the movie feels it needs to add something to the plot which doesn't do much to the film to put in another scene, like how we have to have a panther go savage just so we get a chase scene in the jungle.

The issue holds true for not any other area of the film. There's also the villain's motivation, and if you haven't seen YMS, that motivation is "I'm really really racist". It would have been nice for Bellwether to be developed on more instead of coming in and having no reason except being racist for being evil.

All in all, Zootopia does have a lot of good things. The music is good, the action scenes are fluid, the characters are great, I loved the world, but the villain killed the movie for me. I can find enjoyment in this, but it's not the best. Watch it with some friends, or alone if you just love Disney. It's a good film, but it could be better.

A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires, regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular treatment preaching the current "hip" left-wing social platforms without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points.

All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical romance & coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than a great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to which the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its degree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics) aesthetic merit.

A cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best officer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co- workers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film then descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says that a bunch of predators may be attacking people as "its in their DNA" and the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the people (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her lesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're all from the same race, and that it was really the government manipulating the predators into being evil.

The sloths were pretty funny, though.

This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.

It is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.

The jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof). The voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.

Directed by Bryon Howard and Rick Moore

Starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman and Jenny Slate

Overall: I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and wholeheartedly believe that it deserved the Oscar.

Good:

1. Ginnifer Goodwin does a good job as rookie officer Judy Hopps and her character's optimistic demeanor succeed's in putting you in a good mood.

2. Jason Bateman was excellent as Nick Wilde and definitely outshines Ginnifer Goodwin in my opinion. His sly, sarcastic personality directly contrasts with Judy Hopps which actually works really well.

3. Idris Elba was good as the tough Chief Bobo.

4. Jenny Slate was reasonably as Bell Weather.

5. Phenomenal story with so many mature themes it's actually incredible.

6. Gorgeous animation with an upbeat colour pallet which represents each location well. Speaking of which, the whole world they've built is masterfully designed and is something which definitely needs to be explored in sequels.

7. ++++ This movie makes references to 'The Godfather' and 'Breaking Baaaaad'(Sorry just had to!)

Bad:

1. The villain was very, very weak and did nothing to impress me.

"Zootopia" (for some reason known as "Zootropolis" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.

A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen "Zootopia" know what I'm talking about.) 

This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme. And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature. Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation. Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover.

A world where animals walk on their hind legs, speak English, and have various occupations is a world just like the one we know now. These animals have feelings, dreams, and motivations just like us humans. They experience hardship and persevere even when something seems impossible. Is this world even possible? Some may say so. For the animators of Zootopia, it was completely within their grasp. "Zootopia" is not only an animated movie to entertain children, but also an art form from which people of all ages can learn the true importance of enduring and pushing through hardships.

Zootopia is the kind of feel-good movie that both children and adults can enjoy. It stresses the importance of working through the hard times and making the best of a situation. The main character, Judy Hopps, demonstrates this multiple times. In the beginning of the movie, Judy is depicted as a small, child bunny who has big dreams of becoming a police officer in the big city. However, many people doubted that this feat was even possible, especially for a tiny rabbit like Judy. Even her family discouraged her from pursuing her dream. Despite the doubters, Judy disregarded their harsh words and went to the police academy. Here, Judy grew into an amazing police officer and became top of her class. By proving her doubters wrong, Judy was able to show that she could accomplish the impossible. This is an incredibly important lesson for children to learn. There will always be a time in a person's life where things aren't as easy as we would like them to be. Zootopia provides an excellent example of what we can do when we are faced with obstacles. It is important that this lesson is embedded into young children's minds because they can learn early that hardships occur for everyone and it often happens more than once in a person's life, but despite how hard or how many they come along, you should always push through because the outcome will be worthwhile. 

The second hardship that Judy faces is from her boss. After Judy finally accomplishes getting a job in the big city, she is prepared for anything her boss is willing to let her do. However, her first task is to be the parking maid. Judy is upset, because she had worked so hard to be recognized for her skill, but because she is a tiny rabbit, she was not given the same opportunity that her larger counterparts were given. Taking her task and making the best of it, she decides to double the number of tickets she is expected to give. While on the job, she manages to come across a food market robbery. She chases and catches a weasel who has stolen "nighthowlers." After turning him into the police station, her boss still does not recognize her skill. Zootopia presents yet another lesson to be learned: you do not need others' recognition to acknowledge your own skill. Judy knew that she was a skilled police officer and was determined to show her boss just how much she deserves her job. In order to do this, Judy takes on a huge challenge: find a missing otter.

Judy goes out to find this missing otter who apparently had gone "wild," and along the way, she found all of the other missing predators. Judy makes the mistake of publicly announcing her theory of this "savageness" being in the predators DNA. Her statement offends her close friend, Nick Wilde, whom she met while she was still a parking maid and had supported her the whole way. Judy realizes the depth of her mistake and at first gives up her dream job. She goes back home to her parents' boring carrot farm, however, on this farm, she discovers the true reason for the predator's' "savageness." She apologizes to Nick, knowing that she would not be able to save Zootopia without her best friend. Judy realizes the importance of friendship and the power that apologies have. I feel that this is one of the most important lessons for children to learn, because we need a world of forgiveness and kindness. Too many people in the world are cruel; we need more kindness. 

Zootopia not only provides an entertaining couple of hours for children but also a learning vessel for people of all ages. Through this animation, many important values are expressed. The one that is stressed the most, however, is the value of perseverance. In order to succeed in life, one needs to know how to persevere in spite of challenges that may arise. Zootopia does an excellent job of making this lesson the one that everyone takes away from the movie.

Zootopia Movie Review: Best Movie for All Ages

I don't know what it is about me and anthropomorphic animals. Maybe it's because I grew up watching old cartoons, particularly Tom and Jerry. That could be one of the reasons that I expected more potential out of "Zootopia" rather than "Moana", with both of these films coming out the same year. In fact, many people expected "Moana" to be an instant classic and "Zootopia" just to be a simple animated comedy with nothing groundbreaking in it. Boy, were we all surprised when it turned out that "Zootopia" was actually more smarter and groundbreaking than we realized. It's one of Disney Animation's best films in the past few years, especially considering how they've had a huge revival and have been turning out some great movies in the past decade.

In a world of anthropomorphic animals, a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) dreams of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia. However, everybody doubts she can make it to the ranks. Her parents in particular, want her just to be a simple carrot farmer. But, she decides to prove herself and finally makes it into the ranks. Things, however, don't turn out well for her when the police chief doubts her potential and makes her a meter maid. She hates the job, of course and wants to do something that helps the city. So, she decides to try to solve a case in which many mammals disappeared throughout the city. The chief makes a deal with her though. She has to solve the case in seventy two hours or she'll lose her badge. So, its up to her and a witness fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to solve the case.

One of things that really caught my attention with "Zootopia" was the animation of the film. It's just gigantic. The city is incredibly detailed. It's a city that animals could have built and live in, and the technology they use is ingenious. And the characters are also ingenious as well. They all have relatable backstories, have likable personalities and aren't perfect. That's what great characters in movies should have. Judy isn't always happy-go-lucky and Nick isn't always sarcastic. They goes through all the emotions. They can get scared, angry, shocked, disgusted and even surprised like good movie characters go through. The story is brilliant as well. It's moral focus mainly on stereotypes which us something you don't usually see in movies. In fact, it's mainly making fun of the stereotypes, like what comedies have been doing since movies have been made. That is just brilliant. 

"Zootopia" is just a great movie. It takes the idea of anthropomorphic animals living in a city and gives something fresh and new, something similar to "Inside Out" in my opinion. I do mean it, when I say it's one of Disney's best animated movies in years. It is really that good. It's definitely a must watch and I'm sure like a lot of other people, you'll really enjoy it.

Zootopia tackles a tough topic in a nuanced fashion and is just as entertaining for adults as for children. Judy and Nick are two of the best characters Disney has produced, who would have thought a fox and bunny make such a good team? The animation is very adorable, you can tell the artists worked very hard to maintain the individual species of animals' characteristics while anthropomorphizing them. Zootopia has plenty of laughs but also some very tearjerking or heartwarming moments. I enjoyed the character of Nick Wilde in particular, he takes Disney's "Charming Fox" mantle and wears it as well as Disney's Robin Hood. The voice acting is very good, I completely forgot Idris Elba was in the movie until the end, he IS Chief Bogo in the film. Zootopia is a wonderful entry into the Disney Animated Canon and definitely an instant classic. I think it may have been the best movie I saw all year and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. And again!

This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.

Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.

The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.

The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.

Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.

this is such a great movie! I will always love this movie! Ginnifer Goodwin is amazing in this and I love her in Once Upon A Time!!! She really goes into her character and you want her to be the cop that she believes that she can be. All the other characters are great as well and they have such amazing chemistry! The animation in this movie is great as well and you really feel like your in Zootopia.
