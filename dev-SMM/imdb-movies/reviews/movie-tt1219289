### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.

LOTS OF SPOILERS...

Many times throughout the film, the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for & in the process, didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples:

1) The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash & money in his Brother in Law's apartment, steal it, get away with it and then take the pill, feel the effects, and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder & going down to the station for questioning. Of course, the huge wad of cash/pills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment, an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived - and have no issues.

2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie, the character, to not remember such a basic task, especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.

3) The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchman/lawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be - the custom suit w/ hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences, ones that no one could have predicted.

That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like: 1) Why didn't Eddie, who was fearing for his life, buy a gun & train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2) Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3) After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood, why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w/ a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4)Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?

Lastly - a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy, Hollywood, contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem - the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows, puppies & sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.

Also, with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie & is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.

Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling, fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film - you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 7/10

This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.

There are one or two moments that strain credulity, (I'm thinking, particularly, of the one-eyed thug who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with his gun) but I think every good story has a few of those.

The camera tricks and visual effects used to externalize what's going on in the main character's head are also a lot of fun. Good performances by all the actors.

If you yearn for science fiction movies and thrillers that you can actually believe from moment to moment and haven't seen 10 times before, then I'd recommend this one.

If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a "super-you." The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a "somebody." The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, "What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented. 

I'd definitely recommend watching this movie. If only just for the ridiculous scene with the skates. Hilarious.

The movie starts as a 'what if' story, turns into a mystery, and then transforms itself into a thriller.

The most interesting aspect of the film to me was its theme, namely the limitless potential of our conscious mind. Is our brain a treasure island full of hidden mental powers? At times we surprise ourselves by being able to recall a seemingly obscure fact deep in our memory vault.

Not a few things in the movie kept me on the edge of my seat: the known/unknown side effects of the drug, the shady haunting man, the powerful secret hanging by a thread, and the unpredictable story line.

The film slightly suffers from some loose ends, though. For example, it could do without the thug, and the murder at the hotel could have contributed better to the story line, if more elaborated.

I wish that the ingredients of the drug were rare and the drug itself was impossible to be recreated.

Overall, the acting was convincing and the special effects weren't distracting, but rather cleverly woven into the scenes.

Its ending was rather lame, IMHO. Why not leave us with some unanswered questions to lose sleep over? Well, I love dark endings, like the one in 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks'.

Spoiler: The Matrix is mentioned in the movie.

You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, or at least that's what authors tell us. Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.

It's sold as Bradley Cooper gets smart drug fix from Robert De Niro then must defeat him through a series of cat and mouse games. In actuality Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling writer/slob who acquires a drug called NZT-48, a pill that allows him to recall everything from the briefest of encounters. In minutes he is transformed from a guy no one could believe has a book deal to a man no one can do without. Doors open, too many doors really. Eddie's problem solving solutions end up fanning the flames of questions around him, and before long it seems that everyone in the city is after him. The intricate dynamics that weave this trail of lies is the best since Match Point (2005).

Cooper's performance totally shocked me. He's able to go from panicked addict to conversationalist genius and back without losing the support of the audience. With no key player for Eddie to confide in or take along for the journey, the supporting performances are little more than plot points. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro don't have nearly as much range to showcase in this screenplay. However with a little change, Anna Friel's one scene could have been expanded into something with more drama and likely give Limitless the emotional impact needed for some to take it seriously. 

Enough cannot be said for how amazingly brisk and refreshing the production comes across. Nearly every scene has at least some artistic appeal. This is one of the more attractive films I've seen using the Red digital cameras and I have to give the colorist some praise for the warm palette used to show the influence of NZT-48. Thanks to the mind-altering plot, Limitless is one of the few movies where extravagant transitions make sense. 

Limitless is indicative of a minor subgenre that sprang up around the dawn of the current millennium; I call this the genre of self-discovery. Examples of these films include Fight Club and The Beach and more examples can be found in Asian cinema (where I also believe Limitless drew inspiration for art direction). The primary goal of these metaphysical pictures is to delve into what makes us tick. Limitless asks the viewer to exam what's holding each of us back from being the perfect versions of ourselves, and by stories end this viewer certainly felt inspired. 

I can see room to complain when it comes to the way Limitless approaches relationships. Remember, I'm seeing this as a specialty film about inner exploration and as such I'm allowing for some leeway in how director Neil Burger is able to keep the pace going while focusing almost exclusively on Eddie. Still, I would have appreciated one scene showing how his limitless knowledge afforded him relationship-handling tact. 

Limitless has such a breathtaking pace that you aren't going to find the time needed to nitpick. Some of the action at movie's end is resolved with little plausibility, but it's too much fun to attack. At least the title of Limitless offers some truth in advertising.

A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching.

The movie is of course about an intellectual pill. It's intriguing to know what's the side effects of it. Well, it's quite fun to know what's going to happened to the protagonist but the movie's smartness isn't very limitless. There are massive plot holes in here. There are also some confusion in this.

If there is something limitless in here then it's the entertainment quality. Neil Burger gave a lot of style and ridiculousness in this film. The editing was quite fast and fun. The zooming in through places is amazing. The soundtrack and the music score does perfectly fit in every scene. The performances were good. Bradley Cooper is an entertaining actor but he had some weaknesses in serious scenes like crying or being scared. Robert De Niro only shows up in times but you know him, he is just being himself and there is nothing wrong with that.

Overall the movie is ridiculously fun. The movie is no cliché, it's all unique by so many reasons including the trippy, vertigo, and zooming in style. It's intriguing, it's fast, and it's smart at times. "Limitless" is another movie that has merits that ignore the flaws. It's just a non-stop entertaining solid flick.

Plot: Mind enhancing drug turns loser's life around, but comes at a cost

Just joking. There is no cost.

Lessons learned:

1. Use your exceptional abilities to cheat your way through life by making money for yourself, sex up random women, get away with murder, go into politics, and assist corporate mergers to tighten the monopolistic grips of soul-less business pricks.

2. Ignore the little people. They are a waste of your time. Forget about finding alternative energies, curing diseases, preventing poverty, educating young minds, helping the blind see, the deaf hear, and the crippled walk, bring peace to waring ideologies and religions, and generally enlightening the planet with your super human brain.

3. Drugs are wonderful and we need to use them for the rest of our otherwise vapid lives. Without drugs, we die.

F this crap. Maybe it was unintentional, but I HATE the message this sends to audiences.

I don't even want to bother with the absurd plot holes.

I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.

The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didn't I hear of this book? Anyways, Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is trying to meet a deadline after breaking it off with the love of his life(Abbie Cornish),and is on a downward spiral. He runs into an ex-brother-in-law who appears to be a druggie, but is actually involved in designer drug production, and is ensnared in a plot that leads him from the Russian Mafia to Wall Street. The science behind this movie is very believable and I applaud the producers for being brave enough to bringing it to the screen

An aspiring writer struggling with his love life, an apartment in shambles, a wasteful lifestyle and a writer's block, is left hopeless after being dumped for his ineptitude. He then stumbles upon a past acquaintance who introduces him to an experimental drug that could change his life forever. The intriguing proposition of the story centers around this pharmaceutical experiment that optimizes brain usage to 100% from the meager 20% that we normally use. The problem, that we soon discover, is that supply is limited..... and restricted.

Eddie (Bradley Cooper)'s attempts to write a novel go in vain and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment, his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture, he stumbles upon his ex- brother-in-law who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As he is then confronted by his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent, Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then, whatever he has seen, heard, read or experienced in his life, is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over, he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon (Robert De Niro) employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way, Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake, he would almost lose his life. To add to that, he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself. 

There is always some danger lurking around the corner in Limitless. Even though, the idea of an intelligence enhancing medication seems like the ultimate strength, one always feels restless and is aware of some form of imminent threat. It just seems too good to be true and that is primarily what grips you through this well paced screenplay. 

The film looks great with the camera speeding through the streets and the stunning views of New York city. The mood resembles that of Neil Burger's previous film, 'The Illusionist' and this one is equally intriguing, if not more. The background score is well suited to the film's pulsating situations. 

The beautiful Abbie Cornish plays the tense situations quite well and in confrontational scenes with Cooper, she emerges strong. Robert De Niro gets a Michael Douglas type role where he seems to enjoy throwing his power around. Good to see him threatening people around him because that is what he does best..... Bradley Cooper took complete advantage of the opportunity where he can play a definitive lead and he is quite convincing both as the struggling author and the coolest man in town with higher intelligence. 

Director Neil Burger keeps the momentum going while keeping us glued with suspense, action and twists. A novel idea is simplified in his execution and he makes it easy to absorb it as a reality right from the beginning. He does avoid superficial scenarios and unnecessary drama and chooses to portray the hardships that Eddie encounters while he possesses such power. Limitless entertains with the possibilities and the consequences of uncontrollable powers. However, in the end, it is no 'Inception' in story telling or concept and if you're in with unreal expectations, it will surely disappoint but due credit must be given to Neil Burger for a good execution of the concept that even in the end, doesn't fall flat on its face. 

- 8.081 on a scale of 1-10.

I was skeptical at first about this movie, which is why I didn't go see it the week that it came out. I just figured it was all too obvious what would happen and to be honest some of that did happen yet they did the expected so well that it really didn't seem to make a big difference that I saw it coming a mile off. Which made the things that you didn't expect even better. I enjoyed this movie so much that I would do the unthinkable that I've done only once in all of my years, and that is pay to see it again at the theater. I may even buy a copy of it when it comes out on Blu Ray. THAT's how good this is. The acting was superb and what I enjoyed most is that finally someone knows how to end a movie. BRAVO

Where to begin with this movie? The concept is interesting enough (super drug that enables all our human powers), but the execution of that idea in this movie was a total disaster.

It's an incredibly shallow story, where our main guy works his way up in the system by writing a great book whilst on these magic pills, gets involved with a silly loan shark at some point, who for some reason seem to haunt him throughout the movie. His girlfriend is involved also, and is hunted down by a man who is constantly following our protagonist, and in what is one of the movie's absolutely dumbest scenes, said girlfriend manages to escape from this guy by making a run for it (having hidden from her follower behind some trees for some time, nobody knows exactly why the follower knew she was hiding behind those 4-5 trees, he's waiting there for her for a long time, instead of simply looking behind the trees, something you would do if you suspected someone you were looking for hiding there), using a kid on skates to slash this guy down in an ice-skating rink.

Later on our man manages to achieve success and the American Dream is complete (of course). The conversations in the movie are shallow very Hollywood-esque, easy to swallow, but it doesn't really seem real.

In exploring an idea that could be very interesting, the movie doesn't really deal with or manages to show the different facets of how a brain on this drug could in fact function. We basically just see a person who is "good" at performing whatever it is he does (and the visuals of the movie sharpens or "lights up" every time he takes one of the pills), in this case, investing money and writing, and ultimately, archieves his goal - by staying on these pills. But there's no in-depth exploration of the idea, just a shallow American Dream-story, that we've seen so many times before, but a lot better told than this.

Limitless could be named deepless as it emphasizes on the mediocre rise of a middle-class loser into the sphere of money (bliss) America. However, this movie as a deep sociological impact, in a country where inequalities are on the rise and unemployment is here to stay, thanks to globalization/technology that exacerbate the two. The movie tells you one thing; you can't succeed in America without cheating. The storyline is absolutely pathetic: self-centered and egomaniac "Bradley Cooper" is here to realize the deepest frustration of the average fellow Top Tier university student lacking of intellectual curiosity. More important than the praise of individualism that finish in apotheosis with the most corrupt and probably most egomaniac job in America (senator), there is one major flawed: Why the smartest man on earth cannot make its own NZT drugs? The filming is crucial playing the role of lowering human critical thinking by inducing pseudo artsy effects to please the wannabee hipsters. Beside, the recent trend of mainstream psychological thrillers e.g. Black Swan, Inception, is working so well for the simple reason that it makes the audience feels smart, when in fact the very opposite happens.

Limitless seems like an attempt to push Bradley Cooper out of his Romance/Comedy safe zone and into the role of future possible action star. He's built right for it too, sort of more likable Matthew McConaughey with his chiseled looks and piercing blue eyes. Limitless attempts to do for Cooper what The Bourne Identity did for Matt Damon; remake him from a pretty boy romantic lead into a gritty dark hero.

It works too, for the most part. Limitless is a fun ride all the way through and it's visually striking to boot. It opens with a steady camera zooming through Manhatten, through streets and taxi cab windows, it sets a good tone for the rest of the film.

The story centres around the myth that humans are only using a tiny portion of our brains at once. Cooper plays Edward Morra, a writer with a book contract but a terrible case of writers block. Within the first few minutes he's dumped by his girlfriend for lack of motivation in his life and runs into his ex brother-in-law, from a very brief marriage right after college. Vernon, the ex-brother-in-law is never given a last name because he's only there to introduce the main plot of the movie. He gives Morra a clear pill that he claims will give him the focus he needs to finish his book, along with his business card just in case. Being in a desperate state Morra takes the pill while being shouted at by his landlords wife for being behind on the rent. Within thirty seconds he's deducing everything around him and naturally, beds the wife and does her law school paper that she was stressing over. He then writes a massive chunk of the novel and falls asleep. The next morning he's lost his newfound mental abilities but he does have enough of a novel to hand in to his publisher along with a fantastically clean apartment, being that a side effect of the drug is OCD, apparently.

He stops by Vernons apartment to see about getting some more, but this is where things go wrong. The plot unfolds around Morra using his stash of the drug to advance quickly through the world of high finance, attracting the attention of Robert De Niro, playing a sinister Warren Beatey-type of stock market broker, while avoiding sinister figures who are after every pill they can find and are killing everyone connected to it. Also, it turns out that the drug has serious side effects if you take it regularly but will also kill you if you stop.

It's best if you don't think about the movie and just enjoy the story and stunning visual effects. There are plot holes big enough to throw Matthew McConaughey's ego through, but considering the movie is built upon a faulty premise, picking it apart defeats the purpose. It's just a fun thriller that gives you a couple hours of entertainment. It's well made, well acted and is paced about right.

There is one scene where he licks blood off the floor (because it's laced with the drug) that will absolutely kill any romantic comedy hotness Mr Cooper possessed, but I don't think that's anything but a plus. It just means we might see him expand more into action oriented roles, and if Limitless is any indication, he might just be able to swing it.

I was really looking forward to this movie. It has so much potential: an intriguing and clever concept, superb actors, decent script, good direction, sensational visual effects and editing, so what happened? I can't help but feel there was a great story driven film in here at one time during development. However, somehow studio executives -- no doubt pandering to the teenage boy demographic -- just had to add in all the predictable car chases and shoot-em-up gratuitous action. In the end this action was irritatingly distracting from the very captivating storyline that I kept on wishing they would come back to - i.e what happens when one has unlimited cognitive capacity. This is the same flaw that marred Christopher Nolan's otherwise fascinating story in Inception.

Note to studios and filmmakers why can't you be bold enough to just stick with the STORY? You're squandering these great concepts. Not every film needs to be an action/adventure.

The aspirant writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a complete loser and has been just dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) that sees no future in their relationship. While walking back home, Eddie meets his former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) on the street and Vernon gives the experimental drug NZT to him to increase his creativity to write his book. Eddie uses the drug and the results are impressive, increasing his brain capability and he decides to seek out Vernon to ask for more pills. However Vernon is murdered in his apartment and Eddie calls the police, but the finds the NZT hidden in the stove with a large amount of money.

Eddie uses the drug and successfully invests the money that belonged to Vernon, calling the attention of the financial world. Then Eddie borrows US$ 100,000.00 from the dangerous criminal Gennady (Andrew Howard) to increase his own fortune, but Gennady takes one pill by force and uses it. Meanwhile, the powerful investor Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) brings Eddie to work in his team in a merging operation. But Eddie is chased by a stranger and pressed by Gennady that want the NZT, threatening his life.

"Limitless" is an original and intriguing thriller with the story of a man capable to use the full capacity of his brain. The film is full of action and developed in fast pace, with Bradley Cooper's character experiencing ups and downs while using the experimental NZT in a permanent mouse-and-cat game. My vote is eight.

LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns. The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue. 

Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper attempting to break away from his guy roles in road show movies) is a wannabe writer - a man who has been attempting to write a novel for years but has not achieved one word on a page. He lives off his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) who finally gives up on his mess of a life. Eddie moves into a filthy flat and he takes on the appearance of a street person until he encounters his ex-wife's (Anna Friel) brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who gives Eddie a pill called NZT, a medication that is purportedly able to make the brain use 100% of its capacity (fragments of memory, encountered headlines, books slightly read etc all become immediately available to the 'patient'). Eddie, seeing his life going down the toilet, takes the pill and suddenly becomes multilingual, able to figure out number sequences at the gambling table, not only start but finish his novel, etc: in other words, a genius - for the 24 hour duration of the pill's effect. His changed life introduces him to, of course, the stock market where he makes it so big that he garners the attention of major player Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro) - along with the people involved with the now murdered Vernon who want the drug back: evil Gennady (Andrew Howard) and his thugs (Eddie Fernandez and Ray Siegle) a strange 'man in a tan coat' (Tomas Arana) et al. Eddie struggles through the transition, sells his novel, wins Lindy back, and some years later is running for New York Senator on his way to the Presidency of the United States. And that of course leads to the messy ending that began the film. 

Based on the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, the screenplay (full of holes perhaps due to the same writer's block as the main character's) is by Leslie Dixon and the film is directed by Neil Burger, a man with some creative ideas who concentrates on gimmicks more than plot and character development. And it does have some dazzling visual effects sequences, courtesy of Joe Willems, cinematographer and Connie Brink, Special Effects Coordinator. It is an obvious attempt to compete with the fast action films that make so much box office money, but it is flimsy and may be better off in the DVD category - a category in which it landed early for obvious reasons.

Someone asked me once what I thought ADD medication does. I thought  about it for a second, and replied, "In the simplest terms, it changes  your mind." Sometimes, people's minds need changing. More than just a  push or a boost, sometimes people need help remembering things,  learning new things, making connections between things they already  know, motivating themselves to use that information, etc. 
In the movie "Limitless", there's a pill that does all of that; and  much, much, much more. 
The tagline for this movie is "What if a pill could make you rich and  powerful?" I prefer a line from the trailer: "How many of us ever know  what it is to become the perfect version of ourselves?" Bradley Cooper  plays Eddie Morra, a writer who can't motivate himself to write his  book even when he locks himself in a room with his laptop. He doesn't  do drugs (anymore), but anyone who looked at him would swear he was  always strung out. He doesn't have anything. 
One day, Vernon (played by Johnny Whitworth), his ex-brother-in-law who  is also his ex-dealer, offers him some help: a clear, little round pill  that will clear his mind. Within a minute of taking it, Eddie finds he  can remember tiny things from years earlier, make connections between  little bits of information that he'd never given so much as a second  thought, reason with startling eloquence, and most importantly (to  him), slam out ninety pages of his book in one sitting that make his  publisher beg for more. Does he want more pills after all this?  Absolutely. 
He's not the only one who wants them, though. Despite Vernon's initial  claim that the pill is "FDA-approved", it's clear soon enough that this  is nothing you'll ever find in a drugstore. Whoever Vernon got it from  (and however he got it), Eddie'll likely never know, because Vernon is  murdered shortly after he and Eddie reconnect. Eddie finds Vernon's  stash of clear little pills and proceeds to make over his life. He'll  need every ounce of intelligence the pills can give him, too, to fend  off a ruthless loan shark, the police officer who wants to know Eddie's  connection to the dead dealer, and whatever shadowy figure is following  him from the moment he starts taking the pills. 
In the meantime, Eddie realizes he can do far more than write books  with his newfound intellect. In a few short days, he makes millions on  the stock market, bringing him to the attention of Carl Van Loon, one  of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, played by Robert De  Niro. Carl is more than happy to benefit from Eddie's "freak" status,  and even cautions Eddie not to push himself too far. Eddie has the  brains, but Carl clearly has the experience (and the resources). He  warns Eddie to not try and become his competitor (read: enemy). 
Finally, Eddie has to deal with the drug's side effects. He has waking  blackouts, often finding himself across town, in strange locations,  with complete strangers and no memory of how he got there. Withdrawal  symptoms are worse than your standard medication, obviously, and  stopping could mean hospitalization or worse. Since he doesn't know who  makes the pills or where to get more, this is his biggest problem. 
Or would it be worse to stay on the pills? Eddie claims they're just  making him into a better version of himself, but are they, in fact,  changing who he is? Do they not just change what you can do, but also  what you will do? His girlfriend, played by Abbie Cornish, once had to  deal with a man who wouldn't do anything; now, she has to deal with a  man for whom there's nothing he wouldn't do. The end of the movie  leaves the question of just how much the pills change you unanswered. 
Based on a novel written by Alan Glynn, this movie has plenty of action  sequences to complement the moral dilemma it poses: how far will you go  to become a "better" version of yourself? Like all the great science  fiction movies, this thriller doesn't focus on the sci-fi aspects,  choosing instead to highlight the exploration of humanity on which we  embark with the very first scene. And anyone who contemplates  medication to improve their lives will certainly find a resonance with  the character of Eddie Morra. Watching this movie may not change your  mind, but it will certainly open it.

ALL SPOILERS AHEAD! WARNING! Who wrote this movie, a 6th grader? Why does the smartest man in the world do such stupid things? Why didn't he think of the best way to make an endless supply of the drug right away? Why didn't he figure out how to get rid of the Russian, instead of giving him what he wanted? Why did he choose the stock market and expose himself to all the attention? He could have made a vast fortune in his apartment, trading on FOREX. If he's so smart, why was he popping pills without knowing the eventual effects on his brain? Why was he running from the guy with the knife, who was following him? The guy knows where lives, that part was plain idiotic. I could go on and on, but the worst was, why would anybody that smart want to be in elective office. He would have far more power being a billionaire. This was a dumb movie, I actually was cheering for him to jump off the roof and my wife was telling me to shut up. It was just another drug movie, except it was a brain drug and not heroin.

I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)

So, the good: Original, creative writing. Original, creative, beautiful cinematography. Original, creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable, except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.

The bad: Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The fore-last scene is over the top. I loved it. (My wife said: "They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right?" and they were.) I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the roller-coaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast, the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.

So, unfortunately, this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.

A stylish movie with an interesting premise that delivers more than it fails.

Bradley Cooper, as "Eddie Mora," was good in the lead and actually all the characters in the film were interesting. That includes the villains were credibly menacing.

Anyone who has been hooked on any kind of pill can relate to this film. The pill in this story, however, is different from anything anyone's heard of....and intriguing. You can't help but wonder if you would be tempted to take it yourself.

Co-starring with Cooper and his magic pill is the style of the film. It's very stylish and looks great on Blu-Ray. If you're into visuals, this is a good movie to check out. The same goes for fans of suspense.

I found this very entertaining and a film I would watch again. Yeah, the ending is a little contrived but, overall, it's a fun movie to watch.

What I liked most of all about this movies is unconventional approach to the superhuman ability.

For years Hollywood used the same model about people with such abilities - it's either temporary/bad for them or they have to devote their lives to the good of the community which made them miserable. It's a solid pattern but it becomes boring - look at all superheroes comics adaptations.

There is a certain appeal for broader public in such model - if everyone is equal in it's abilities, no one would feel bad :) When watching this movie I was expecting just that - he takes the drug, it's all rainbows and sunshine, then he would discover some side effect that would make taking it impossible and the rest of the movie would be watching him stop using it. He would just go back to being normal but would get the girl because he is "the nice guy".

I was pleasantly surprised! He actually manages to keep using it :) This is something I wouldn't expect from Hollywood movie.

I like to this pattern breaking. First one I noticed was Iron Man when main character was allowed to have fun throughout the movie.

Limitless (2011)

A sharp, twisting, wishful film, well done and intriguing. If you can throw this in with other mind-bending fantasy films with tinges of sci-fi reality like "Eternal Sunshine of the Everlasting Mind" or "Momento" you'll see both its strengths and intentions and maybe how it falls a little short of those rather startling and full-blooded films.

The idea here is simple--a pill makes you use your brain to its full capacity, so you can learn and perform at astonishing levels. But this also wears you down physically and chemically, so that you not only get hooked on increasing doses but start to have side effects. But when you are on the pills, you do things that the rest of the world notices.

So our leading man played by Bradley Cooper (normally a secondary actor) takes it on. What layers it up is the reasonable idea that you can't keep this kind of power to yourself, and some people will go to incredible extremes to have and control this power. If this sounds a bit like heroin--or maybe some kind of heroin/ecstasy/cocaine mixture that gives you the best of everything without killing you first--it should. The parallels to all kinds of illegal drugs are everywhere, promising one thing and leading to another.

There are some very nice filming techniques going on here--some tracking shots that go on for blocks in fast motion (probably contrived with CGI), some brief distortions (when the drug kicks in), and lots of careful use of filters on the lens (the world takes on a saturated golden hue when under the influence, and is otherwise believably gray). All of this sucks you in, consciously or otherwise. And the events take you one step to the next.

It's a little weird that this is all slightly un-affecting in the end, especially at the very end, when there is one last shift of trajectory that is sudden and a bit unconvincing. I didn't quite feel for the leading character so much as I was interested. One problem might actually be over-explaining the situation, and the main reason for this is voice-over narration, a lot of it. The main character keeps coming in to explain things that we kind of already knew, and certainly sensed. Or would have figured out a few minutes later, and when we get to that next scene and see what he has just explained, it's a bit dull. It's basically like repeating himself repeatedly. See? It's not necessary.

But remove the narration, or just chill out a bit and go with the flow, and you have a really good movie, pure entertainment with enough angles to keep it sailing.

My friends recommended me this movie, but in fact what encouraged me to watch it was Bradley Cooper. I like this man. This movie worth every minute of watching. The brilliant about this movie is the story. A new way to make the mind work 100% full power. It showed us a lot of possibilities about what can be "The Full Power" of a human mind. I read about these stuff every now and then, but I didn't imagine it like that. The writer who had this idea and this scenario is genius and have a lot of imagination. And also the ways Eddy handled his problems with were very interesting and smart. I mean every problem he faced, he found a quick solution for it. At last, he managed to balance his life. 

VERY AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!! 10 out of 10...............

Once in a while the protagonist is a villain and most viewers just don't get it because the low moral standard. Brad Copper was handsome, charming, very smart, speaks multiple languages. However he used his newly found brain power for totally selfish reason. He showed no remorse after killing an innocent woman. At the end he wanted more power over others by running for senator. He's a pure evil.

I couldn't believe that most audiences rooting for this wicked selfish man. He robbed his dead friend without seeking revenge for him. He cheated his girlfriend with many others. He killed an woman without facing the consequences. He ratted out the lawyer and helped to kill him. Could you name one thing that he did for the benefit of others? None.

Most people can tell that Hitler was an evil man. But they can't tell that a totally selfish person without conscience has a thirst for power is a devil too.

A cautionary tale lost in your average stupid viewers.
