### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Greetings again from the darkness. This is my third "first feature" from a writer/director this week, but there endeth any similarities. Ana Lily Amirpour presents the first ever Iranian romantic vampire thriller that blends the styles of Spaghetti Westerns, graphic novels and 1950's rebel flicks, while making a social statement regarding Muslim women.

This festival favorite is an expanded version of Ms. Amirpour's 2011 short film of the same title, and the use of black and white, combined with cinematographer Lyle Vincent's extraordinary photography, delivers a beautifully stark dream-like atmosphere that lends itself well to the sparse dialogue approach.

Despite minimal conversation, we quickly recognize Saeed (Dominic Rains) as the ultra-arrogant drug dealer and bullying pimp, Arash (Arash Marandi) as the hard-working dutiful nice guy who sees himself as a would-be James Dean, Hossein (Marshall Manash) as the drug-addicted dad who burdens his son, and Atti (Mozhan Marno) as the aging, powerless prostitute with little hope. There is even the street boy (Milad Eghbali) who sees all and says little  and is the target of the film's most terrifying scene (and maybe one of the most terrifying bloodless scenes of any horror film).

What really stands out about this low-budget gem is the seamless and effective mixing of genres. In addition to the "vampire" moments, there are a couple of the most quietly erotic scenes that I can recall (including an ear-piercing), and even a quite humorous scene with an under-the-influence Arash mesmerized by a lamp post while wearing a Dracula costume and being observed by a real vampire.

The vampire is played perfectly by Sheila Vand, whose intoxicating eyes and subtle facial gestures convey all whether she is feeding her appetite, being gently seduced by Arash, or slowly coasting on her skateboard. Her only time to unleash pent-up emotions is the previously mentioned scene when she warns "Be a good boy". Otherwise, she is the lonesome vampire in search of connection who periodically weeds out the bad men  simultaneously improving society and empowering women.

It's an odd production as the characters speak Farsi, but filming took place outside Bakersfield, California in a locale that fits the story town's name, Bad City. Any influence of Iranian culture is only evident through interpretation and the excellent cast. The beautiful camera work is complemented by an outstanding and unusual soundtrack  a combination that proves Ms. Amirpour's eye and feel for storytelling. The minimal dialogue approach is successful thanks to the atmospheric style and the talents of the cast (many of whom will be familiar to American TV and film audiences). It's an exciting first feature and has many anxiously awaiting the next project from Ana Lily Amirpour.

Within the first 2 min of this film, anyone with any level of knowledge on cinema can admit to the film's "uniqueness" in style, looks and the neo-genre it is trying to create from the ashes of genres such as western and vampire. That much is evident right off the bat. and it summarizes the overwhelming high praises it is receiving in the festival world. This powerful revelation leaves you in anxious excitement to want to see and know where this journey is taking you and how it will leave you. 

The story happens in an imaginary city in Iran called "bad city". A very 'sin city' like atmosphere where basic human values have vanished and what is ruling this land is money, corruption, extreme misogyny and LOTS OF OIL. As a matter of fact, oil refineries seem to be the only legit functioning industry within this very bad city. One can only guess where the oil money is going to and how it is being spent judging from the state the city is in.

The glorious black and white cinematography paints a very dark atmosphere that quite effectively suits the characters, storyline and the location. Almost every shot was carefully composed to the point that you'd want to pause the film to appreciate them to the fullest.

The most important and powerful aspect of the film, besides its brilliant cinematography, is the vampire character: both in substance and style. Taking in the fact that chador, a tool of female oppression, is used as the vampire's cape took a while to sink in. the juxtaposition of both of those concepts, oppression and domination, made the character mysterious, powerful and quite fascinating to watch. Sheila Vand is very effective as the vampire as well. She wears a cold, inhuman and aloof face yet there is so much sympathy and curiosity within her. She hit both spectrum quite well. There is an iconic tracking scene of the vampire skateboarding on the road which cinematically is one that will always stay with me. It was purely magical.

The vampire is out to get justice for all the women that are being harmed by the patriarchal system they find themselves in. in a creepy scene, she stalks an old man on the empty streets of bad city. The reversal of roles here hits the right note and it acts as very competent punch line that sets the tone for the whole film. In the end, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is in the simplest of terms "Style over substance". The film sets up a brilliant and for lack of a better word "unique" platform to explore the unexplored and to say the unsaid. However, It sadly leaves a lot more to be desired. Most of the scenes drag on for too long. If done right, silences within scenes could be a powerful tool to assert things that no word can. But this was not the case here. Such silences made the scenes drag for too long offering nothing in return. It seemed that Amirpour wanted us to take in the atmosphere and the inner-character tensions that was supposedly going on, but sadly nothing of substance could be found there, no matter how hard one tried.

This was one of the most anticipated art-house horror films. The fact it's done in Persian with Iranian director and crew absolutely peeks every filmophile's interest. Unfortunately, the hype surrounding it sometimes works against anticipated releases like this, but the wait was worth it.

A Girl Walks Home...was heavily influenced by Jim Jarmusch's aesthetic, like a love letter to this director. A vampire western with a touch of romance - something I haven't seen before. Let's see if this unusual combination worked... The last few years were great for vampire subgenre, reviving it with a few films that have became instant favorites and, in my opinion, deserve their place in film history.

Let The Right One In and Only Lovers Left Alive are notable examples, and now A Girl has joined them, forming fantastic trinity of style, ideas, cinematography and unparalleled atmosphere. Modern vampire subgenre works best in authentic urban surroundings, with as little action sequences as possible, focusing on loneliness, inner turmoil of the characters, existentialism and sometimes unlikely companionship between humans and vamps. A Girl has it all, adding extra cultural layer to these key ingredients.

Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive have set vampire tale in Western and Eastern world both, and A Girl... paints excerpts of Iranian life. (Although filmed in California) the rest is authentic. This black&white picture offers style and atmosphere, quiet, meditative and rarely violent, it's filled with music and shadows. There is a running thread of social commentary although the town and premise are fictional.

Mysterious titular 'Girl' in fictional town named 'Bad Town' stalks the residents quietly, watching them go about their routines, helping the weak and good, punishing the crooked and corrupt. We know absolutely nothing about The Girl, but there is a pattern...unlike women in Iran, she has a certain, albeit supernatural power, and she uses it to punish men who have bullied others and wallowed in vices. Even if I'm only reading into this, I thought this was liberating in the context of the culture that's old and rich but traditionally repressive against women.

However, The Girl is not some feminist vigilante fixing to destroy the mankind, just like Eli in Let the Right One In, she protects those in need. Unlike Eli, The Girl does not look for symbiotic relationship with disposable humans, the companionship she forms with Arash is of different nature. Big shout out to Masuka the cat, the talent and screen presence is fantastic and adorable. One lovely and immersing cinematic experience, bravo, Miss Amirpour!

Here's how this film got me into the theater. It sported gorgeous black and white photography, was filmed in Farsi, and was a vampire art-house flick. Behind it was the apparently unstoppable hype machine powered by Vice Films (and Kino Lorber, usually a distributor worth watching) who promoted the picture beyond its actual appeal, in part with a dishonestly paced trailer. The ingredients sounded amazing. It was the perfect bait.

But there's simply no there there. The marketed hallmarks that made it seem different turn out to mean nothing.

Yes, it's in Farsi, but it's culturally void of anything Iranian beyond that. It's actually filmed in Bakersfield, California. and while Bakersfield comes off as starkly cinematic, the whole endeavor feels extremely western. So if you're going to catch a glimpse into an under- represented culture, you're not getting that here. It's cool that there are some great roles for Farsi speaking American actors, but it means nothing and serves nothing. Even if it had taken place inside the persian community in Bakersfield that would have been interesting enough, but that's not the case. This is a fictional, western-pulp style Iran community called "Bad Town" and it sets up a whole series of creative decisions made for their cool factor rather than for any deeper purpose.

Yes, it's an art house flick, but it's least ambitious kind. It celebrates style over substance. It's about nothing. It assumes that disaffection equals cool and chooses aesthetic principles over theme at every turn. It takes stabs at greatness, imitating some of the giants of the Nouvelle Vague, Post Punk and No Wave cinema (others have cited Spaghetti Westerns as an influence, but that's only on the soundtrack) but when all you have is image and music, unsupported by character or theme, you miss what makes the greats great in the first place.

Yes. It's a vampire movie. And the lead is affecting and beautiful, but it's yet another "cool" vampire narrative so soon after the great Jarmusch gave us much of the same with LAST LOVERS LEFT ALIVE. But Jarmusch is a much more seasoned filmmaker who is able, even in his most non-narrative attempts, to place emphasis on style AND character AND theme. LAST LOVERS LEFT ALIVE. LOVERS is more than a music video or a tonal exercise, GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT isn't, and it doesn't aspire to be. It's also not scary or creepy, which it obviously doesn't have to be, I'm fine with its tone, just don't go in expecting a horror film. Even still, I do long for the days of a good scary vampire movie.

And so that leaves us only with the gorgeous photography by Lyle Vincent, which, quite frankly, saves the whole flick. Without it this would be an intolerable bore featuring a few really strong cinematic moments. But every shot is truly a joy and the film relies on it almost completely. If you love beautiful cinematography, than that's it's saving grace.

Other bright spots. The music is excellent throughout. Sometimes it rises to even greater heights than the sequence it's supposed to be supporting, but unquestionably, the director uses music to great affect. There are some really nice little moments sprinkled throughout. The final and climactic death is an especially beautifully done piece of filmmaking and the two leads are lovely and fun to watch in their few scenes together.

But in the end the movie is more tedious than meditative. It's pretty obvious it was a short film first, now stretched out beyond its means. I love the cinema of the slow, but I have to have something to contemplate if a long languid shot is to have any real hold over me. There must be something underneath the image and the music, I must feel that there is some meaning in the exercise, or at the very least that I'm seeing something fresh and different. And here there is no meaning, or if there is it's surface and barely qualifies. There's nothing really new here at all, actually. The parts seem unique but the whole is tired.

I will, however, be snooping around Amirpour's future films in the hopes that her aesthetic will one day find an engine of purpose and that her cinema will have something unique to say.

In Bad City, Arash (Arash Marandi) is a young man that lives with his father Hossein (Marshall Manesh), who is drug addicted, and he brings a stray cat home. Arash has a car that he bought after working for many years. One day, the drug dealer Saeed (Dominic Rains), who is also a pimp, takes Arash's car to pay the debts of his father. Saeed abuses of the prostitute Atti (Mozhan Marnò) and soon he meets a young lonesome woman (Sheila Vand) and takes her home. However she is a vampire that attacks abusive men and homeless and she kills him. Meanwhile Arash steals a pair of earrings from his employee and goes to Saeed's house to get his car back, but he finds Saeed dead. He brings his car and a wallet with drugs and money with him and starts dealing drugs with the users. He goes to a party dressed of Dracula and two girls give drug to him. Arash wanders through the streets completely lost and he stumbles with the vampire that brings him home. The vampire meets Atti and then Arash schedules to meet her during the night in a sort of date and he gives the pair of earrings to her. In the morning, Hossein trashes the pictures of his wife and Arash gives money to his father and expels him from home. Hossein takes the cat and goes to Atti's house and abuses of her, forcing Atti to use drug. The vampire attacks Hossein and kills him. Soon Arash finds the body of his father dumped in a wasteland and he decides to go away from Bad City with the girl. When he meets her, he finds the stray cat at her home. What will Arash do?

"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night" is a weird black and white American vampire movie spoken in Persian. The story is strange and original and the viewer never knows or can guess what will happen next. This film has been nominated and won awards in independent film festivals and does not disappoint those that like to see a different movie. My vote is seven.

I was a bit disappointed to learn after seeing A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night that it was not an actual Iranian film. Turns out it is entirely American funded and made in California, it's just that it has an Iranian director, crew and cast, while it is set entirely in the Farsi language. When I say I was disappointed it was only that I truly wanted to believe that a film with such frank scenes of sexuality was being made in Iran. There has been something of a surge in Iranian films in recent years, most prominently in the case of the excellent drama A Separation (2011) and I thought it could be possible that this was another in this cycle. Alas, but no. Still, that doesn't deter from the fact that this is a pretty singular bit of work. I suppose the very fact that it is an Iranian film made entirely with American money is in itself pretty interesting.

Like another of 2014's best horror films Honeymoon, this one is also directed by a woman. Ana Lily Amirpour is of Iranian descent but born in the UK and brought up in America. I guess because of her heritage coupled with the tensions between America and Iran, many meanings seem to have been interpreted in this film. I think the truth is that this is a film with some minor political undercurrents but which takes its influences far more from cinema itself. Set in a bleak dusty place called Bad City, a settlement full of drug addicts, vice and despair, it follows a small group of characters one of which is a female vampire who roams the streets at night preying on the worst in her society.

It wouldn't be unfair to say that this is an exercise primarily on style over substance. This doesn't bother me personally, as I enjoy films that embrace cinematic style. It's typified by great black and white cinematography with lovely widescreen framing. It is also a mash-up of film genres with a hero and car which evokes 50's teenage rebel films, Ennio Morricone inspired music that references spaghetti westerns, moments that recall the odd tone of David Lynch movies, the visual look of Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983) and the revisionist approach to the vampire film typified by Let the Right One In (2008). When you combine all of these disparate elements together in an American film shot entirely in Iranian, the result is a very odd film indeed. I guess you could call this a feminist vampire film, in that she only attacks predatory and immoral males, while she is quite far removed visually from the slinky female bloodsuckers from many a European vampire flick (although there certainly isn't anything wrong with them!). It also plays on the idea that the Hijab veil looks similar to the garb of those traditional vampires. It is also distinctive for having bizarre details such as a prominent cat, a skateboarding vampire and a soundtrack that mixes Persian music with new wave influenced western pop. The latter being a particular favourite of our vampire lady.

My feeling on the film overall is a little mixed. I really appreciated the visual style and the original aspects inherent in an Iranian vampire film, while the mix of genres did create something new. On the other hand, it begins very well and does meander in the second half somewhat. It would probably have worked better as a ninety minute movie given the slightness of the material itself. Still, it has to be praised for going somewhere new and it shows there is always a different way to approach old ideas.

Arash and his father Hossein 'The Junkie' are harassed by drug dealer Saeed 'The Pimp'. Saeed takes Arash's classic car and picks up The Girl. The Girl turns out to be a vampire and kills Saeed in his home. Arash goes to Saeed's home and finds him dead. Arash takes back his car and steals some of Saeed's cash and drugs.

I was very excited to check out this Iranian vampire movie. It looks cool. The black and white looks good. However something isn't right. Then I realize it's not Iran. The exotic location is such a draw for me in this instance. It's worst than the standard Toronto-for-NYC movies. I expect it from them. Taking that aside, this is better than most experimental indie horror. It's not scary at all but it has good moody style. For the standard indie horror, I give it a 6 if it works on some level. This does have the look and good moody atmosphere.

When I was younger, my friends and I would go to the video store and rent the cheesiest B-Movie title we could find and laugh at the plot holes and general cheesiness. In college we would do the same on pay-per-view while we drank and do the same. As expected the B- Movies mostly had poor production value, needless nudity (usually with just one character who was into that), and overall didn't take themselves seriously and certainly didn't pass themselves off as artsy by making it black and white.

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night has all the elements of a B-rated movie, but can't decide whether it wants to be a fun cliché vampire movie, or a social commentary on the topic drug use and prostitution in the Iranian community. It can't be both. You can't have a fun movie with the over-acting of the father smashing things while he's going through Heroine withdrawal and then have a D-bag pimp dancing to techno. 

Speaking of the pimp, the whole movie has some of the worst elements of LA Iranians in general where they use every American Cliché they can find be it the club, vampires (seriously, the vampire fad was over in 2010), the rave, black and white, the gardener, the wannabe James Dean, etc. and the movie missed an opportunity to use Iranian elements. As it stands, this is a cheesy American B movie that uses LA Iranians and Farsi dialog. That's the extent of the Iranianness of the movie.

Speaking of the dialog, everything about it seemed un-natural and forced. Non-Farsi speakers reading the sub-titles may not notice, but for Iranian viewers, it really seems like the script was written in English and translated to Farsi first. The actors make almost no effort to become the character or take any risks. It's just dry reading of the script without passion. The cat had better acting.

It pains me to say this, but Iranian film-makers have a long way to go if they want to let their presence be known. There are some great Iranian American Actors - Argo ("the girl" is played by an actress on that movie), Homeland, SNL, but they need to find an American director and writer to get over themselves first and put these great actors in a position to win. 

Anyway, if you want to support Iranian film makers and throw some money at them, then go watch this, or if you're an American who wants to show you're artsy by watching films other people don't watch, go watch this. If you are a little weird, watch this movie.

How to write about a film like this without giving away too many details? Almost impossible. The film is really fun to watch and it is good not to know too much of the plot because many twists and turns function best if you do not expect them. Although this does not mean you cannot enjoy it again, once you saw it. The mood of the film shifts between serious and persiflage and in that it is very well balanced because it never tips in either the one or the other way too much. Although it makes fun of the genre(s) it is scary too in the right moments. It keeps you guessing and although the film uses many situations from different genres that you know, the way they are put together and set against each other creates a very entertaining film. To describe the mood, it reminds me of Aki Kaurismäki's movies, especially the use of music and looks and the dialog. Did this review tell you what to expect? Certainly not! Go and see for yourself!!! :-)

In my 5 decades of enjoying film I thought that I had seen every genre  possible. Musicals, horror, horror musicals, foreign films, cult films  and independent all. I thought all my bases were covered. But as I sat  at the Bell Lightbox Theatre for a screening of A Girl Walks Home Alone  at Night, I was quick to realize that this was the first Iranian black  and white vampire film to hit my filmography resume. 
A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night comes courtesy of writer/director Ana  Lily Amirpour who took her 2011 short of the same name and stretched it  into a feature film. A Girl Walks Home at Night focuses on a young  music-loving female vampire (Sheila Vand) who stalks the streets of Bad  City casually picking her prey. On a collision course to intersect  story lines is Arash (Arash Marandi), a young man with a prized car who  spends his days caring for his heroin addicted father (Marshall  Manesh). Arash and our vampire antagonist first meet after she feasts  on a local drug dealer, Saeed (Dominic Rains). Saeed supplied Arash's  father with the drugs that kept him incapacitated and the family debt  results in Saeed leaving with Arash's cherished car. When Arash heads  to Saeed's home in an attempt to reclaim his vehicle he finds Saeed  bloodied and dead with a briefcase full of drugs and money left  untouched on the table. Arash takes the briefcase and the new found  fortune commences a character arc that will eventually lead Arash to  meeting the vampire girl under a street lamp after a costume party. 
The two leads spark up an unlikely relationship with the girl hiding  her vampire-ism from Arash as the non-sexual bond between the two  intensifies. But when Arash's father becomes a victim, things become  complicated and life-altering decisions are made in its wake. 
A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is soft horror. Shot in glorious black  and white there are some scenes of blood and a few seconds of violence,  but the film is primarily rooted in the characters and Ana Lily Amipour  masterfully weaves the tale through familiar ground without losing to  the temptations of stereotypical checklist horror positions. The  overall body count is low and there is no abundance of secondary  characters and sub-plots to deviate from the original story. 
Amipour uses a wide range of music from multiple genres which fit  seamlessly into the story as if she was tutored on the importance of  music in film by Quentin Tarantino. Some exceptional lighting used for  shading and shadows made A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night an intriguing  watch but not necessarily an important one. The film is slow. Maybe too  slow. And the characters are interesting but not involving. We  appreciated the style, but wished for there to be more meat on the bone  to keep us from having to focus on the lighting and music to pull A  Girl Walks Home Alone at Night from meritocracy. Style took the film as  far as it could but the lack of anything truly original kept us from  wanting anything more once the screen finally faded to black.

"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night" is a movie that you thought couldn't exist: an Iran-set movie that mixes the spaghetti western genre with vampires. In fact, in the opening scene the woman makes a face reminiscent of some a person in a Fellini movie. Overall, Ana Lily Amirpour's movie depicts a presumed seedier side of Iran, the sort of image that you get of a polity in a Quentin Tarantino movie (without the pop culture references and over-the-top violence). It's set in a fictional industrial town where the residents have no discernible future prospects. The vampire reminds me of the vampire in the Swedish movie "Let the Right One In": she relates to people like any ordinary human would, and she just happens to be a blood-drinking creature of the night. Even more eye-opening is the cast: Sheila Vand co-starred in "Argo" and appeared with Robin Williams on Broadway; Marshall Manesh co-starred in "The Big Lebowski"; and Mozhan Marnò co-starred in "Charlie Wilson's War".

I understand that Amirpour's next movie is basically "El topo" meets "Dirty Dancing", starring Keanu Reeves, Jim Carrey and Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo on "Game of Thrones"). If this movie is any indication, her upcoming movie should be a neat one. In the meantime, I recommend "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night". Really fun.

After having heard about the film for months,I was pleased to see that the title had been chosen for one of the joint viewings on IMDbs Film Festival board,which led to me getting ready to see the girl walk home.

The plot:

Taking Arash car as payment for his dads heroin addiction,drug dealing pimp Saeed runs into a mysterious women walking the streets of Bad City at night.Taking the women back to his apartment,Saeed discovers that she is actually a vampire,who reveals her fangs and kills him.As the women walks out of the apartment,Arash goes to try and pay Saeed for the car,only to discover that Saeed has been killed by the girl who walks home alone at night.

View on film:

Clouding the fake Iranian town in murky black and white,writer/director/co-star Ana Lily Amirpour gives the movie a rough Film Noir appearance,as every corner of Bad City reeks of decay.Going out onto the streets of Bad City, Amirpour splashes bold comic-book surrealism across the screen,which goes from the rebellious 50's teens cars,to the enchanting sight of a skateboarding vampire. Whilst showing a good eye for giving the title a unique appearance,the screenplay by Amirpour is disappointingly unable to bring the images to full- bodied Gothic life,with the sparse nature of the dialogue leading to the characters feeling rather flat,and the film being incredibly dry,as the girl crawls home at night.

A young man tries to help his drug addict father and make a decent living in a deserted city where crime seems to be the main activity. A somewhat vigilante vampire comes to play and falls in love with him.

I tried hard to appreciate this movie. Visually it is interesting and dream-like, but it's an almost 2 hour wait for something to happen, that never does.

I was hoping the ending would bring some light into the giant metaphor I thought this was, but nope. If there's a metaphor in there, I missed it.

I'd give this slow, bland and boring film 3/10. A movie with such a poor plot can never be good, only a visual exercise. And this looks just like something a cinema student would present his class mates with.

Personally I'd stay away from it, but if your into Indy, slow, weird movies that go nowhere, you'll probably love it.

A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT interested me because I'd never seen an Iranian film before, let alone an Iranian horror film. I've since discovered that this was actually filmed in California, albeit in Persian language. It's sadly an extremely pretentious, art-house style movie that tells an overly-familiar storyline in an overly-familiar way. The whole 'Iranian' thing is made up in order to draw attention from the critics, otherwise this would have been instantly lost amid a welter of similar imagination-free Z-grade fare.

It's the sort of film that riffs and pays homage to lots of old film genres, with westerns being the most predominant. The crisp black and white photography aside, this is an art-house bore for the most part; the characters might dress in different attire and use a different language, but they're just the same as in a similar Hollywood film. The whole film has a Western look and feel to it so you might as well just be watching a Hollywood movie. A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT has no real character or bite; it merely consists of long, drawn out moody scenes and the occasional bit of blood-letting. I hated it.

I am a horror fan since the days of black and white creature features. I have always loved a good, offbeat vampire movie such as the original Let The Right One In. I rate A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night just below that movie -- but still an outstanding horror movie -- in a genre in which excellence is so rare.

The actors are great. You hate the pimp / drug dealer; you like the young man; you sympathize with and simultaneously hate the pathetic, old, drug-addicted pervert. The vampire - you love her. She is an exotic beauty underneath a black cloak. I'm guessing the director chose this actress for her eyes -- beautiful and hypnotic.

The setting - Bad Town - is the type of bleak, lawless industrial town where a vampire could prey for a long time before moving on.

I would have enjoyed this movie in color, but black and white is fitting for its dark atmosphere. Highly recommended.

"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night" is an interesting movie. More a curiosity at moments than a movie with a body and a plot, it ends being saved by its atmosphere and the cinematography, even if some of its moments fall into the silly.

A vampire is roaming an Iranian town. She goes around killing 'bad' men, talking with people and just being very, very shy. She becomes friends with a young guy. Will she end up killing him?

Who are we kidding. The movie doesn't really care about vampires or anything. On the other hand, it has a very nice atmosphere and some of its aspects, like the music or the bleak black and white, give it an atmosphere close to a Western. The camera-work is good, and the direction acceptable enough. There are a couple of scenes really good. The acting, however, is a little bit stilted and, in a couple of occasions, just too silly. The vampire's movements are hilarious (not sure if on purpose).

"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night" ends being a movie that will be enjoyed more by people who like their movies about atmosphere and 'messages'. Just forget about plot and pace.

How scorn works: Ana Lily Amirpour is a female! She has a Middle Eastern background! How striking! Let's patronize with exceedingly low expectations. Cue rave reviews...

Don't fall for it.

Let's instead show the woman some respect, and be frank. This film is utter garbage.

A vampire who kills those who are mean to womankind. She even steals a skateboard from a kid! Are there no limits to her malevolence?

Glacially slow. The film is a series of largely disconnected tableaux peppered with shots of an industrial landscape and a nondescript suburbia. The acting is appalling.

For me, this was a movie about loneliness and love - every single person in this movie is so lonely and lost and searching for beauty and light - there's a lot of other interesting things about this movie, a commentary on how Muslim women are treated, an ode to horror movies and westerns... but the depth of it and why it touched me was the characters who were all lost looking for love in the darkest of places. The film itself was visually stunning and the soundtrack great, I also loved how different it was, you would be hard pressed to find a movie similar - it has it's own heartbeat and uniqueness. Sure it starts slow, and is slow, you can't be in a hurry to get through this movie, but that is part of what makes it so wonderful because that tone makes you feel how the characters must feel lost and stuck in this "bad city." With the Farsi dialect and the interesting yet familiar iconic characters it is like walking into a different world that somehow you know. I loved the vampire, her acting was so subtle all done with her eyes, an animal that you couldn't trust yet wanted to. For those who say this is a pretentious film, I'll never understand, it's ARTSY, but it is not overly aware of itself or trying to be pompous, it's just telling this weird story with these weird characters with this very stylized feel and if you just open yourself to it and go with it and let it wash over you I think you will love it as much as I did.

I think that this film is a good reminder that in many ways story takes precedence over visuals as far as engaging with the audience is concerned. The visuals of A Girl Walks Home At Night ranged between good and enchanting. There isn't any reason that the aesthetic of the film should prevent anyone from enjoying it. For the most part the presentation of the film is great and makes it unique and gives the sense of exploring a setting totally distinct from others portrayed in the medium. If the film only had a stronger narrative drive then it could utilized a lot of what I feel is untapped potential. At a certain point scenes start to feel loosely connected and I started to wonder where the story was going and what any of the characters were really hoping to accomplish by the end. Maybe it's my own fault, but somehow, somewhere during the viewing, I lost interest in what was happening or what potentially might happen.

While it isn't really clear to me what the director's intended statement is in the film it's difficult to imagine that identity doesn't play into the overall theme. The impression I took from the film is that what defines people is not how they envision themselves, but rather how they appear to others and the effect that they have on their lives. A good example of this would be Saeed. When we see Saeed with Arash and his father, he is large and centered in frame. In that scene Saeed is portrayed as a tyrant with complete power over those around him. When we see him with Atti he is a coward shut in his car, fidgety and more short tempered. In his last scene with the vampire, he gyrates and debases himself before screaming in panic and agony. In this final instance he is a dumb pervert. What the film may also be trying to get across is that whatever value we wish we had, others find in us. Arash wants to be seen as cool by the people around him, but only finds that the vampire sees personal worth in him and draws him to her as a result. The vampire likewise is off putting to others and sees herself as a monster, by her own admission she's done bad things. It's only when Arash finds comfort in her companionship that she is able to realize that value in herself.

One aspect of the film that I think serves to emphasize its themes is the costumes. I would argue that the most important costume in the film is that of the vampire's. I would also argue that this costume is made much more effective by the decision for the film to be in black and white rather than color. The most obvious effect of the vampire wearing the hijab is that it gives her an air of mystery. With part of her head and much of her body being obscured it there is a sense of the unknown that is lacking when the vampire is in her room, dressed more casually. The darkness of the hijab working in tandem with the low lighting and lack of color greatly emphasizes this mystery and brings with it a sense of terror. Often the vampire appears like a specter as she almost drifts down the sidewalk stalking her prey. This effect is also a nice contrast to the more open outfit worn in scenes shared with Arash inside her room. To speak of Arash, his costume also reveals things about his character, though I would say in a more meta fashion. Frankly I could not help but be reminded of James Dean or Marlon Brando when by the end Arash is clad in a tiny white T-shirt and leather jacket. While those articles of clothing do not carry to much real significance on their own, the fact that they are reminiscent of well established rebel figures in film does a lot to express the general attitude of the character. The imagery allows us to project things onto the character which he might not make clear about himself. 

I think the main thing I would like to take away from this film has much more to do with the narrative than with the characters or presentation. As I have already expressed, I feel that the film lacks narrative drive. Often I found that scenes would play back to back but they failed to feed into one another. I would not say that this goes for all of the film and the instances where the story does flow more organically makes me think that if the entire film were woven together in the same fashion. It's difficult to maintain interest in a story when you're constantly wondering where it's going or how anything is really connected beyond just having the same characters in different scenes. Another thing I would take away is to be very aware of the meta aspects of film which audiences are familiar with. I've already mentioned the costumes but what I would like to highlight is something in the film which I felt was perhaps the worst part of the presentation. The sounds that the vampire made when she actually feeds on and intimidates people I think are not only over the top but will be familiar to audiences. Honestly about a dozen movie monsters and wild animals went through my head the instant the vampire started growling and consuming people. I gather that those noises are meant to be scary but I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't the only person whose enjoyment of the more supernatural scenes was greatly diminished by the completely uninspired part of the film. Overall though I would say that keeping in mind the film tropes that audiences are most familiar thing is very valuable when trying to realize a unique vision that you want taken seriously.

I realize there will be those that gripe that this begs for legitimacy by being filmed in B&W and using catchy music with faces aching "sigh" as they move through their Iranian urban existence alone and without. If this is a reason to be dismissive so be it, but I'll take something so beautifully photographed, small in the scope of a certain sect of characters within a specific environment but visually written in painterly strokes to get the most out of the setting. A heroin junkie father who has left his son struggling to make ends meet, losing a nice ride he saved so long for to a sleazy drug dealing creep looking for payment for the debt of the smack provided to pops. A lovely vampire in a chador with penetrating eyes and enigmatic presence eyes human meals considered worth feeding from, leaving them for dead because they seemingly represent the scum of society, finds her possible soulmate in the heroin junkie's son. The street lights gleaming piercing white, haloing the characters as they haunt the empty sidewalks and roads at night. The vampire becoming smitten with this misbegotten young man absent a parent with his mother gone and the father surrendered to his addiction. Catching the guy as he was seduced by a popular girl of privilege during a costume party to take an X pill, which sends him into an exhilarating trip, under the influence with his inhibitions lowered, dressed in cape as Dracula, the vampire finds him alluring. Great scene has her pondering whether or not to bite him as his throat was available, this realization that he could be her *one* stilling the urge for another drink. The foreground/background composition between the vampire, in chador, and the heroin junkie father, who she is following across the street; this has the aesthetic of a true talent. The kid with the skateboard running across the vampire with her asking if he's been a good boy, threatening him is an instance where we see the predator surveying her potential prey. The seductive face of the rich beauty who is forbidden to the junkie's son, looking like a siren calling to him as he lingers in his drug-influenced daze, only for an attempted kiss to be denied. He is not in her social standing, no matter if he's dreamy and attractive to her. The film is a romance wrapped in the art house disguise of a vampire film.

A smashing debut from Amir Lily Amirpour. Shot on a shoe-string in gorgeous black and white, this is funny, dead-pan, creepy, punky, sweet, sly, smart, violent, sexy, mysterious, loaded with style, and the most off-beat celebration of feminism and girl-power I may have ever seen on screen. Great use of music too.

It's a vampire story set in an alternate universe that looks like barren, poor, poverty stricken post-industrial America, but where everyone speaks Farsi, and our anti-heroine wears a chador while skateboarding through the night. While there are a lot of genres being toyed with here (spaghetti westerns come strongly to mind more than once), at heart it's an odd, sort-of love story between a feminist avenger vampire and a lost young guy who is burned out with caring for his heroin-addict father (a much older parent drug addict is only one of the many cliché breaking elements of the story).

Clearly touched by David Lynch and echoing early Jim Jarmusch (though in an interview on the disc Amirpour says with charming and very funny candor that she's not a fan of Jarmusch), this is really exciting new cinema that may have been inspired by forerunners, but has a voice all it's own. For a while, I've felt I never really needed to see another vampire film. How many variations can there be? Well, this proved me dead wrong. I can't wait for her next film!

Note on the blu-ray: The Kino collector's edition blu-ray has a ton of terrific extras (including an entire graphic novel by Amirpour) and it looked amazing on my home screen. Professional video review sites were split between those who flat-out loved the image, and those who see flaws. But for me, the images were rich and powerful, and none of the problems the more mixed technical reviews sighted crossed my mind or caught my eye.

A calm, alluring & subversive art-house endeavour from Ana Lily Amirpour in what's her feature film debut, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is as impressive as it is unconventional, as beautiful as it is brooding, and as hypnotic as it is haunting. Touted as "the first Iranian vampire western", it is a fascinating blend of horror, romance & western that's original, meditative & masterly composed.

Set in an Iranian ghost-town that reeks of death & loneliness, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night tells the story of a lonesome vampire that wanders the desolate streets at night; stalking, killing or protecting whoever she deems fit. But things change when she comes across a guy who's just as lost as her and, in an effort to connect with each other, something beautiful is born between the two.

Written & directed by Ana Lily Amirpour, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is crafted with stunning restraint & presents the up-n-coming filmmaker in absolute control of her craft. Lily Amirpour's direction exudes both patience & confidence as she spins her own take on the vampire folklore with this twisted fable of two lost souls without giving in to genre conventions, and isn't afraid to employ silence as a powerful & effective tool.

For a debut feature, it is an incredibly sophisticated effort, and Lily Amirpour not only exhibits her firm grip on storytelling elements but all filmmaking aspects. The story takes place in Bad City, an Iranian town in the middle of nowhere, and the deserted locations, vacant streets & fraction of denizens add to its graveyard like aura while the resurfacing shots of drilling pumps perpetually sucking oil out of Earth serves as an interesting companion to its vampiric themes.

The script is only concerned with the doings of two characters, Arash & The Girl, and the rest of the town's inhabitants are discerned by simple tags assigned to them. What's also admirable is that it is never in a hurry to switch to the next moment and actually embraces the silence & emptiness that permeates every frame, which in turn contributes to its somber tone & funereal gloominess. But there are also times when its extended takes bring the narrative to a standstill.

Shot in crisp black-n-white, Cinematography brings an elusive quality to the whole picture with its static camera-work, skillful use of slow-mo technique & beautifully composed shots, and further intensifies its otherworldly setting. Another one of my favourite aspects is its mesmerising soundtrack, comprising of sensibly chosen tracks that are evocative and always in check with the emotional requirements of any given moment.

Coming to the performances, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night features a committed cast in Sheila Vand, Arash Marandi, Mozhan Marnò, Marshall Manesh, Dominic Rains & Rome Shadanloo, and each one of them get sufficient time on screen. Vand's subtle expressions & unwavering gaze turns her silent showcase into the most impressive performance in the movie and she is brilliantly supported by the rest of the cast, each playing their part with utmost conviction.

On an overall scale, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a somber effort that's elegiac in its approach, dreamlike in its presentation, and subdued in its addressing of topical themes. Crafted with care & intimacy, it promises an etherial, absorbing & aesthetically fulfilling experience to those willing to embrace its slow-burn narrative and marks a promising start to Ana Lily Amirpour's filmmaking career. Although its fangs aren't as deeply embedded as I would have liked, this thoughtful meditation on loneliness is still a delightful discovery that's worthy of a broader audience.

This film(?) is very bitter and depressive. The writer tries to imitate "Sin City" to show Iran is completely corrupted. I wonder positive reviews, because there is no plot in this movie whatsoever. On top of that, as a devout Muslim I was offended to see that this film ridiculed Hijab and showed the main negative character (vampire) wears black robe that is generally worn by Muslim women in Iran, and even worse, in a poster visible in one scene, we could read "If you look like this, call ... (telephone number of a psychologist)". This movie could have been summarized in a 15-minute short. I think the story pace was very slow. The film maker should train more, and try not to offend anyone.

First off, props to the title for the movie. A title this extraordinary warrants immediate interest. I knew nothing about the movie going in and I'm glad for it; the defining point for this movie, the vampire haunting Bad City, has a fantastic reveal that launches the movie from a lull to enthralling. For that twist alone, it is worth seeing this movie just for the same rush of emotion. (To be honest, I didn't even know the movie had a vampire in it, that's how little I knew about it).

All of that being said, the black and white color scheme and the surreal style give off a David Lynch-like vibe, similar to Eraserhead. This pays off with some genuinely creepy and scary moments, but a lot of the time it comes off as camp and ridiculous. One scene meant to unsettle and disturb can be followed up with something eliciting laughter. Then again, the setting is called Bad City, and one character met early on is some wannabe gangster type, with the mannerisms to match.

The odd tone likely comes from being less of a horror movie and more like a drama with horror elements. There's a lot more focus on character interaction and conflict between them than actually trying to scare you, which makes for a compelling story. But then it will draw away from that to show clips of oil pumps or a person playing with a balloon. These diversions could be rationalized as establishing traits of the aforementioned "Bad City", but they distract from a movie that's mostly spent dealing with its character's vices. Some plot elements partially distract as well, in particular one point where the movie probably feels they used Chekov's Gun adequately, only to add to the overall absurdity up to that point.

I did enjoy the horror this movie had to offer, and I especially enjoyed the prominent attention to characters, but the flippant tone and oddball content draw too much from the story and how much of an effect it could've had. I've seen the movie called "style over substance", which is somewhat fitting; there's plenty of both here, but the style takes the center of attention more often than not. The movie still interested me from beginning to end, and I'm anticipating whatever future work the director (Ana Lily Amirpour) will put out next.

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night(2014) Starring: Sheila Vand, Arash Marandi, Marshall Manesh, Dominic Rains, Rome Shadanloo, Milad Eghbali, Reza Sixo Safai, and Mozhan Marnò Directed By: Ana Lily Amirpour Review THE FIRST IRANIAN VAMPIRE WESTERN Hello Kiddies your Pal The Crypt-Critic is stalking the night wit his favorite suckers for the night in a Foreign land. In the Iranian ghost-town Bad City, a place that reeks of death and loneliness, the townspeople are unaware they are being stalked by a lonesome vampire. This plot/synopsis it sounds like something I would invest whether it be foreign or western. I usually only watch Foreign films if there Horror, Monsters, or even sometimes romance. This was both but I wasn't a fan. I mean I liked Let The Right one In. But this film it just came off as like a film with a good idea and acting behind it but a weak narrative for telling what would otherwise be a magnificent story. I'm giving it a 2 and a half out of five.
