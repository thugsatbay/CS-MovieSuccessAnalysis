### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
It was my great privilege to be invited to the world premiere of Sylvain Chomet's follow up to Belleville Rendez-Vous.

Set in Edinburgh and produced by an old pal of mine, Bob Last, I had very high expectations indeed. Not least because it is not every day that one of the world's most beautiful cities (my own) would be caught in artful majesty for years to come. And indeed it was. Edinburgh is a real star of this charming but very slight movie.

The city shimmers throughout, but the story sadly does not. It reminded me of a novel by Irish writer, William Trevor, called Felicia's Journey in which a young girl is taken into the trust of an older man. In that book (and subsequent film starring Bob Hoskins) and this, there is a slight air of seediness. (That's maybe going too far in the case of The Illusionist but the comparison was palpable for me.) Why the protection? What are the man's motives? I found it mildly uncomfortable. The fact is, in neither case are the intentions, apparently, anything more than protective; but somehow the feeling persists in both that all may not be as it seems.

Belleville Rendez-Vous arrived on the film scene like a bolt from the blue. This, sadly, suffers from that difficult second film syndrome. It oozes class and charm from every pore. It looks sublime. But the story (a Jaques Tati cast off) fails to deliver. It simply does not have the muscle to sustain 90 minutes of screen time.

A real shame because it has a great deal of merit.

Heart? 8/10.

Head? 6/10

Simplicity is a very interesting word that is defined in many ways. "The Illusionist" is a film that is synonymous with this word and is a visual representation of the art of simplicity. Nominated for every major best Animated Feature Film award including a 2011 Oscar Nomination birth, "The Illusionist" is more than just one of the best-animated films of the year. Will it win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film? Probably not just because "Toy Story 3" went on a record breaking spree within the animation genre, however, "The Illusionist" is just as good as "Toy Story 3" if not a little better. The film is based off of a script written in the late 1950s by a French, mime, actor, and director named Jacques Tati, but was forgotten about until Director Syvain Chomet picked up the script and ran with it producing an 80 minute animated masterpiece. The film follows the travels of a French Illusionist from town to town looking for work while performing his artistic magician craft in small shows. However, his profession is lost within the changing entertainment era causing him to lose hope, until one day while traveling in Scotland he met a young girl named Alice. Alice changes his life with her belief that he is actually a real magician seeing through the illusion of magic and personifying it into being. The Illusionist becomes a father or grandfather figure to her as they grow together down very separate paths.

The simplicity of the film goes hand in hand with the authenticity and depth of the very easy to watch story. The animation is 2D brilliance with every image on the screen having deeper meaning of some sort. The film uses its filmatic space avoiding lulls and capturing the viewer's attention with its very short run time. This is achieved by the craft of Director Chomet who has created a picture that is so well done it does not even feel like its animated. This can be attributed to cinematography used with the animation. A camera seems as if it is filming the film almost as an alternative reality in a medium that would not of been as effective if it had not been animated. Authenticity is evident even with the minimal dialogue acting a throwback to a simpler era; silent film. It does not rely on its dialogue at all spreading it few and far between, however, when there is dialogue it is true to the setting and the nature of the film. It is in French and guess what? There aren't any annoying subtitles.

For some viewers the fact that the film is in French and that there aren't subtitles (I bet the DVD/Blu-Ray will have the option) it may be very frustrating. Also, this is not necessarily a kids movie. Kids will enjoy the magic behind "The Illusionist", but will not appreciate it as much as adults because of the immense amount of symbolism in the film.

Contemporary film seems to be all about glamor, special effects, and money leading to the creation of hit or miss films. However, film as an art is much simpler than that, which is a metaphor that resonates within the must see film "The Illusionist". Remember simplicity, simplicity, simplicity.

All my scepticism was futile, thank God! This animated charmer really oozes Tati's peculiar brand of character comedy from every single pore.

Yes, the story is more sentimental and streamlined than the master's original efforts, but Tati's central issues (such as old-fashioned life-styles and values confronted by modern technology), his eye for detail, his pleasantly reserved humanity and his wonderful sense for comedic timing and subtle gags are all left intact by the careful makers of this gem. And the rendering of the Hulot character with all his distinctive mannerisms is a joy to behold.

Plus, it's good to see beautiful hand-drawn animation for a change (with sparse use of CGI techniques.)

Sylvain Choment's latest film adapts a script by Jacques Tati. The film's unique style is only being shown in forty cinemas across the UK, its box office status falling behind the animated Pixar hit Toy Story 3.

Those who are followers of Tati's work or loved Belleville Rendez-vous will inevitably be drawn to such as personal piece. As will those seeking out a different experience from Disney, Pixar and even Studio Ghibli animation. This film, however, may confuse or bore those who are looking for the usual Hollywood narrative. It is a shame the detail of this touching story will be overlooked by so many. KH

Based on an unpublished script by Jacques Tati, The Illusionist follows a magician named Tatischeff, a man whose art form of illusion is dying. He begins taking any job that comes along his way, and even while in Scotland, is accompanied by a young girl named Alice. Tatischeff and Alice develop a sort of father/daughter bond, and Tatischeff ponders his own life as well.

The film is directed by Sylvain Chomet, the man probably best known for his 2003 animated art-house feature The Triplets of Belleville. One thing that I simply adore about The Illusionist is that Chomet follows closely to the phrase "Actions speak louder than words." The film's dialogue is minimal, and for it's storytelling relies almost entirely on animation, body language, and a simple, but beautiful musical score written by Chomet himself.

This isn't even mentioning the animation style itself. I've seen many 2010 movies, but The Illusionist is easily the most gorgeous. The characters are given fluid and realistic movements, and the ambient surroundings of the city and hillsides are outstanding examples of art-direction. I practically had to suppress the tears (And no, I'm not kidding).

You may find a movie you like better than The Illusionist, but frankly, I don't think you'll be able to find a SINGLE. DAMN. MOVIE. more beautiful than this one.

Silent-ish - albeit with the odd, annoyingly generic multi-lingual aside (think that irritating 'Nichole? Papa? Citroen advert) - animated film about a 1950's magician's voyage from Paris to Edinburgh via the Scottish Islands and Highlands. The struggle to find and retain work in a dying craft is beautifully depicted, especially in the final moving sequences when he leaves his rabbit on Salisbury Crags, and a poignant note for his young hanger-on saying 'there are no magicians'. It looks great - as other reviews have said, a real love-letter to Edinburgh in particular, although it veered into 'tourism TV advert' territory rather too much for my liking. The strength is in the beautifully-nuanced period detail. However, some of the farcical vignettes were clichéd and rather dull, and the lack of dialogue meant that the limited storyline failed to hold my attention at times. But I can see why it was chosen to open EIFF this year, and it's a definite feast for the eyes.

This is the opening film at this year's Edinburgh International Film Festival and I was lucky enough to see it today with my delegate pass. It's an animated film by Slyvain Chomet. The film did well at Berlin Film Festival earlier this year and I predict it will do very well at Edinburgh this year as well. 

Briefly the film is about a French magician struggling with his trade, who meets a young Scottish girl. They travel to Edinburgh together and explore the city. I don't want to say too much more than that for anyone reading who wasn't seen the film. 

Things I loved about the film were that there was barely any dialogue, most things said were in either french or Gaelic and I understand neither, yet I understood the whole film. This is because visually the story is told through actions not words. It's masterfully told this way and beautifully drawn,

The visuals were just stunning. I live in Edinburgh where most of the film is set and it made me want to get out and enjoy the city. The drawings aren't always geographically accurate but this doesn't matter. That doesn't affect the film, I just happened to notice because I live here.

I loved the subtle humour in some of the backgrounds. Your eye was skilfully drawn to the right places by use of colour placement. A warm glow behind the main character may link to a flyer stuck to the wall. The main character will then walk to pick up this flyer. This was brilliant.

On the downside I thought that towards the end the story began to lag a little, maybe just being a tad too long. Other than this there was little I did not like. The ending though when it came brought me to the verge of tears, it was that beautiful. I urge everyone to go see this film when it comes out, or in EIFF if you can get tickets.

The long-awaited follow-up to Belleville Rendez-Vous is out at last, and director Sylvain Chomet must be the number one in a field of one, when it comes to contenders for making a long-lost Jaques Tati script into a feature-length animation.

The underlying premise of the story here is the same as in all Tati's films: Old is Good, New is Bad. Variety theatre conjurer Monsieur Taticheff is one of the last of the old troupers as TV and rock 'n' roll kill off music hall in the late 1950s. In search of gigs, he takes his grumpy old rabbit and leaves Paris for London, then heads north to the Scottish isles and finally Edinburgh. Along the way he is joined by bored and lonely little Alice, who believes his tricks are the real thing. He has to take on menial jobs to keep up the illusion of magically producing yet more gifts for her.

The Paris, London, countryside and Edinburgh of the Fifties are lovingly recreated in charming detail, always bathed in the warm light of nostalgia, and all people - and even the animals - are extreme caricatures while being totally sympatico. The hand-drawn, hand-carved feel of the whole film is greatly added to by some amazing special effects, and not surprisingly with Chomet, there is some genuine magic tucked in there, too. There's just too much in almost every scene to grasp at one sitting, from the crowded country pub to the busy, aerial views of Edinburgh and, like Belleville, it will bear several return visits. It's a truly fantastic ode to the theatre, pre-motorway Britain, Jaques Tati himself and the bitter-sweet meaning of life.

Sylvain Chomet's long-awaited follow-up to The Triplets of Belleville adapts an unfilmed screenplay by French master Jacques Tati. Chomet's film doesn't feel much like a Tati film, though - it's very much a Chomet film. But that's okay. I wouldn't want some poor director to feel he has to ape another filmmaker's style. The Illusionist follows a vaudeville magician, modelled after Tati (and called Tatischeff, which was Tati's real last name). He's old, and his world is starting to fade. He leaves France for an extended tour of Britain. Eventually he finds his way to a remote Scottish island, where he meets up with a young woman, Alice. When Tatischeff leaves the island, the girl coyly follows him, and he pretty much adopts her. The two go to Edinburgh (or a fictionalized, Edinburgh-like city) and Tatischeff gets a regular job at a theater (and another at a gas station, secretly, at night) so he can provide the girl with the beautiful clothes she desires (having existed in squalor on the island, she has never seen dresses as beautiful as she does in the city).

The biggest resemblance that it bears to Tati's films, besides the Tati caricature at its center, is the fleeting, impossible romance between the man and the girl. All four of the M. Hulot films contain this element to one degree or another. In The Illusionist, the relationship falls somewhere between the analogous romances in M. Hulot's Holiday and Mon Oncle. In Mon Oncle, there is a teenage girl who has a crush on M. Hulot, but he knows he's far too old for her and treats her in an avuncular fashion. In M. Hulot's Holiday, he is quite a bit older than the blonde, who is frequently bothered by boys her own age, but at least he has a chance. In The Illusionist, Tatischeff is an old man. He does love the girl. He can keep her, but can never have her. She essentially isn't any different than his rabbit - living its life in a cage. When it's free, it's only going to bite his finger when he gets too close.

The film does not contain much in the way of the grotesque oddities that fueled The Triplets of Belleville. It is much subtler, gentler, and more beautiful. It has a grace all its own. It can be very funny when it wishes. Chomet has obviously spent years on this film, and it looks spectacular. Even if he had made only The Triplets of Belleville, his reputation amongst cinematic animators would be secure, but The Illusionist puts him very near the top of the list of the greatest who ever lived.

When I went to go see this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival there was a big buzz surrounding it. People were enthralled that a movie would focus so much on the city, but did it do Edinburgh justice?

A few minutes into the movie Edinburgh comes into picture. Set in the 1950's we see a quiet and very quaint Edinburgh. It features heavily on many of the monuments still present today and I love the way we see the architecture unaffected by modern builds. It made me wish I lived back then. The 3D shot that encapsulates all of Edinburgh in one go, is mind-blowing. 

However, as much as I loved seeing Edinburgh in the wonderful rich colours of detail, I was disappointed by the rather gloomy feel to the movie. Yes, it has its charming moments, especially with the merry, drunk Scotsman character, but much of the side plots and main plots I feel are a tad melancholy which in turn, sobered my experience of the film. 

The little dialogue (mainly in French and Gaelic; I don't understand either) is pretty easy to follow, but during the end of the film I was left cold when I misunderstood small phrases. It did frustrate me a little, but it led me to interpret the film differently, giving an ambiguous feel to an overall very charming and impressive piece of animation.

Since the post-WWII wave of neo-realism, filmmakers have been exploring the beauty within the recesses of the urban landscape. The Italians had Rome's 'any space whatever'; the French New Wave caressed Paris; Woody penned his love letter to Manhattan, Spike wrote his to Brooklyn; Jean-Pierre did Montmartre; John Hughes did Chicago; and now with 'L'illsionniste' Sylvain Chomet has Edinburgh. The film is, indeed, bestowed with loving detail upon Scotland's capitol. Sadly, the narrative providing the means for discovering the city imparts a final impression of cold disillusionment that starkly contrasts with the city that I've come to know in the last three years.

Chomet tells the story of an aging slight-of-hand magician -- a cartoon of an already cartoonish M. Hulot -- who takes his outdated stage act from Paris to Scotland's Hebrides isles. His magic and kindness inspires a naïve young maiden to tag-along with him and the two find themselves in Edinburgh. The remainder of the film is a coming-of-age story for both characters: a slowly paced, melancholy journey of economic hardship and broken enchantments. The city crushes the magic and mystery of life, leaving the viewer with an acute sense of doomed mortality.

Of course, glimpses of brilliance can be found. The animation medium befits the Jacques Tati character as well as Edinburgh itself, and Chomet's restrained style teases out the occasional smile from the ordinary moments of life. Unfortunately what is missing is the very thing I love most about the city: its people. Edinburgh is a city of extraordinary people and heritage. It seems then, that though Chomet's heartfelt intention was to show off the city he calls home, he failed to recognise its most remarkable asset. It's the people that give life to Edinburgh and without this city of endless stone does indeed seem cold. Had Chomet focused more on the characters' interactions with the residents as opposed to themselves, I think the film would have better communicated a stirring sense of hope and quiet pride that would have left the viewer with a greater desire for and appreciation of the city of Edinburgh.

"The Illusionist" was good, but I don't see what the great reviews were about. (I agree with a previous writer who compared all the glowing reviews to "The Emperor's New Clothes.") 

The animation was, indeed, subtle and exquisite, but I couldn't get into the story. Maybe the story itself was too subtle for me. Maybe I expected too much, since I thought "The Triplets of Belleville" (same director; hand-drawn animation) was one of the best movies I had ever seen.

I felt no connection with either the man or the girl. The other characters popped in and out so quickly that they were almost forgettable. And the ending was unsatisfying.

If I had seen this first, it would not have prompted me to see 'The Triplets of Belleville'.

NOTE: This is NOT a movie for children.

This is the great L'illusionniste, not the Neil Burger/Jessica Biel/Ed Norton version. While I thought the ill-timed The Prestige competitor was entertaining, it's not even in the same film-making universe. For those of you who are not familiar with Sylvain Chomet's work with The Triplets of Bellville, he showed his live action skill directing that bizarre segment of Paris Je T'Aime involving mimes and the Eiffel Tower.

The story is quite simple: a traveling magician finds himself in Scotland performing in a small town. A girl sees his magic and believes it is real. She follows him to Edinburgh all the while believing that the gifts, money, and food he provides for the both of them are fabricated out of thin air. The original story was written by Jacques Tati, a French mime, director, and actor from the mid 1900s. It is a love letter from him to one of his children, but it is unclear whether the story is written to his first child abandoned in infancy or to his other child with whom he never spent enough time. Either way, there is evident a sense of melancholy and guilt in the magician's care of the girl. He sneaks out to a night job to afford to buy her the coat, dress, and shoes she desires; he always produces her spending money with a magical flourish; and he never tells her to her face that she shouldn't believe everything she sees.

On one hand, you want to hate the girl  she latches on to the magician and seems so naive and even greedy at some points. On the other hand, the magician chose to keep up the illusion (ooooooh!) and never exposes her to the harshness of the world. It's not until he believes she has someone to care for her that he

SPOILER ALERT HERE

disappears and leaves a note that simply says "Magicians don't exist."

I first saw this film in January at a fairly crowded art theater. Young, old, artistic, and not were all there. When the film's last scene closed, and the credits began to roll, there wasn't a sound in the theater. Nobody spoke, nobody got up to rush out like they normally do. We all just sat there in silence, unsure of how to feel. I was sad, inspired, resentful, and had a lump in my throat. Few films have that impact on me and fewer make me run out to see the movie again. I think the biggest problem (only in that it leaves you a bit confused emotionally) is a lack of closure. Nothing really changes  we don't get to see how the girl reacts to the truth. The magician moves on with his life and career, seemingly untouched by the brief time with the girl. We want a happy ending, a kiss, a death, anything to leave us without an open end to wonder about on the way home.

I have not even begun to talk about the beauty of the film. Character design was excellent, from the Brit-pop band to the angry little bunny that makes me laugh every time. More than ever, it makes me long to visit Scotland, the homeland, so I can see Edinburgh firsthand. The artistry of the film is only outdone by the subtle sadness of the story told without any real dialog.

This film is instantly one of my favorites. See it in theaters, see it on DVD. See it.

After just having perused some of the most obnoxious and idiotic "reviews" for this film, one just has to speak up. Two fools on here actually go so far as to imply the film has overtones that make them uncomfortable, namely an older man and younger woman. This, of course, says more about the "reviewers" than anything on view in the film; note to "reviewers:" get a life or seek help.

Then you have the Tati acolytes who think they know everything and decry the film just because someone else had the temerity to make it. Then you have the just plain ignorant, with several people talking about how long the ninety minute film is. Note to ignorant: Sans credits, the film runs seventy-two minutes. 

The most horrible films have drooling, rabid "reviewers" crying "A neglected gem!" about films that should be deposited in a trash can. But for this? This they decry. Unbelievable. 

I'm not going to say much about the film because it should be discovered. It is a film of magic, it is a film of beauty, it is a film of small moments, it is a film that will ultimately be considered a masterpiece and these selfsame anonymous "reviewers" will jump on the bandwagon and blithely forget what they originally said. 

See it. Sylvain Chomet is the real deal.

I pretty much had the same opinion of this film as most of the reviewers here on IMDb. I loved the incredible, stunning visuals but thought the story was so-so.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a prettier animated film, especially when viewed on Blu-Ray. The artwork in here is simply jaw-dropping, scene after scene. I just wish the story had been as much fun as Sylvan Chomet's previous effort, "The Triplets Of Belleville." This story is kind of drab - the opposite of the beautiful drawings, under the art direction of Bjame Hansen.

For you adults that would like a serious, almost melodramatic story in a different genre (animation), this film should be extremely appealing.

For the artwork alone, I found it worthwhile watching.

Perhaps I should begin by stating that I have not seen Belleville Rendez-vous, have never had any real desire to do so and whilst I have seen a couple of Jacques Tati films he is someone I can take or leave. I checked out The Illusionist on the basis of what amounted to several Rave reviews plus, many of which made a point of mentioning the hand-drawn animation rather than cgi, plus the knowledge that the film touched on vaudeville in Paris in the 1950s. I didn't expect it to eclipse Clouzot's Quai des Orfevres which dealt with French Music Hall in the 1940s or Paris,'36, which did the same for the 1930s and the Popular Front but it is a subject in which I am interested so I checked it out. Whilst I am not prepared to endorse the 'rave' reviews in the National Press I did find it well made and moving with an incredible attention to detail.

A film by French film maker Sylvain Chomet, who also directed The Triplets of Bellville. It is a wonderfully delicate film, visually it provides a lot of interest and is particularly relevant to those who know the city of Edinburgh in which a large portion of the film is set.

As an animated film, The Illusionist has the feeling of being children's film, however the film has an extreme dearth of dialogue, with only a few spoken lines, which are not all in English. Nor is the film action packed or concerning a character to whom children will readily relate. Like the opening scene of "Up" The Illusionist conveys the arc of life and the melancholy of old age, an issue most children will find it hard to understand. From an adult point of view this is a bitter-sweet, beautiful film.

In 1950s France, magician Tatischeff is finding it increasingly difficult to make a living as his style of entertainment goes out of fashion. Tatischeff travels across Europe looking for a home for his act, and picks up orphan Alice along the way, finally settling in Edinburgh.

The film has some comic moments, Tatischeff's uncooperative rabbit who resents being pulled out of a hat, provides one such moment, although these are tinged with the melancholy which runs throughout the film.

The film's story is linked with the life and work of Jacques Tati, though how closely is widely debated. The debate and the elements of Tati's life which are said to inspire the story adds an extra level of depth and interest to the film.

The calm and serene beauty of the film, with little action, virtually no dialogue and a soundtrack which lulls you into a dreamlike state the film verges on dull and soporific. While the overwhelming sadness which runs throughout the film causes a sense of woe, leaving you contemplating the message of the film.

The semantics of the titular character's table-side note can be disseminated and reassembled however the viewer chooses, but The Illusionist a dedication to the idea that "magic"..."illusions" are inescapable. Subsequently the people who perform them do exist.

At various points illusions are shown which are neither controlled or "performed" as such. The Illusionist's rabbit "disappearing" into the soup is a good example of this; another: the Illusionist pretends, or is misunderstood as an auto-mechanic, but none-the-less performs his assigned task; another: Alice gradually dressing-up and impressing a past analogue of herself; another: the subversion of the scream-inducing alpha-male rock band into effeminate go-go dancers. If we're to carry this notion further into film clearly this "note" (and if you want, the entire father-daughter relationship) is simply another ruse...an unintentional machination devised for her to be happy. His eventual collapse into a "magical decline" (due to his dying art-form and the dilution of its grandeur) and his final denial as a magician all culminates in her happiness. It is an exact analogue to the Illusionist's having removed Alice's stale red jacket to reveal a prettier white one.

Not only this but as we leave the apartment the window blows open and creates a fluttering mass of shadowy uncertainty on the wall; Alice and her boyfriend are purposefully depicted in bright colors against a sea of umbrellas; the lights dim, but do not "blacken", the ventriloquist's puppet in the shop window; and most importantly, the TVs still shine light in the closed down shop.

Finally then, The Illusionist and Chomet (as magic and magician) perform their final trick on us: a child loses their small pencil in the train car, and as the Illusionist picks it up he pairs it with his own longer pencil and makes them disappear into his sleeve. Here he has a choice to make the child's pencil magically lengthen...but instead returns the very same smaller one. The same prop is replaced, through illusion, with the same prop. Likewise, the relationship of a father with his daughter is gradually replaced with a stronger, mutual one (compare the voyeuristic peering of the Illusionist as he comes home drunk with Alice's first kiss in the rain). The "same" is disappeared by "different" and returned as the "same", magic replaced by stronger magic. Or if you prefer...reality itself.

I was looking forward to this film, but was sadly disappointed. In common with Chaplain and many others, Tati fell into the pathos trap later in his career. Long drawn out, deeply unfunny routines, holding up what is essentially a non-story, do not a movie make. The only reason for the three stars is that the animation itself is undeniably wonderful. But as with 3-D and Dolby surround, it's only there to serve the story, which frankly bored me to death. A middle aged failure bewildered by modernity is a frequent theme of comedy performers, and they nearly all make you want to hit them over the head and plead with them to stop asking for our pity. This film was an exercise in animation, nothing more. The cloying, unending melancholy has nothing to brighten it or change direction. In essence, nothing happens. My companion liked it, saying it was a slice of real life, but I would argue that animation isn't about real life, and it certainly isn't enough to justify the money spent on it. If you want to see a great animated film, watch Toy Story 3. This is like a painting, a lovely adornment, but don't expect to laugh, cry or be moved, it's too predictable and empty. Sorry Jacques, sorry everyone, this one missed by a mile.

The Illusionist is a strangle little animated feature from France that is quite different from anything i have seen for a long time. Beautifully animated with some delightful sound affects to back it up . This the story of an Illusionist and his friendship with a young girl. This is not a children's film yet there is nothing in it to stop children watching it , i just think it's too dark for kids to enjoy. There is very little dialogue in this film because it relies totally on the brilliant animation. Movement are over exaggerated and the characters are of all shapes and sizes. It reminded me a little of some of the animation i saw on TV in the 70's and A Christmas Carol is one of those cartoons that spring to mind. I really like the first 45 minutes of this but i have to admit the final half left me a little cold. Once the novelty of the movie died off the story took over and the end was slightly depressing and a bit of a damp squib but I'm sure a lot of people will love this simply because it's so different.

I've never been to Scotland, but I will be there, thanks to this film. This is what Cinema should be like, no dialogue, no storytelling, no plot, but the flow of intra-atomic magic. Yes, magicians do exist, and Sylvian Chomet is one of them. No illusion here, only the pure magic. It is not simply about the rural and urban sets, but how Chomet makes us move around them. The backgrounds are rarely static, we have characters moving around the city and then we simply leave the characters on the street and continue our journey through the city ourselves, the background becomes the foreground, the city becomes the character. Simply outstanding animation, brilliant and beautiful. Chomet designs most of his characters himself, and boy, are we in luck. This is when he gets a real cartoonist, every single character including the 'extra's has a soul behind their fantastical features, every single one of them looks like Chomet has put his horcruxes into them. They simply awaken the desire in me to collect them, like Pokemon creatures. And just when you think this is about the mesmerizing visual experience, you realize that the film is already inside you, you never noticed it entering, but it is there, filling you with the sensation only exclusively moving pictures can produce.

Chomet is the Exupery of Animation and I am off to the streets now.

This is more of an opinion, because previous posts did a great job of reviewing this movie. The great: beautiful artwork and animation. I loved the water-color look of the scenes. The good: individual scenes of magic and characters (such as the acrobats--very cute). Bad: Picking the rabbit up by the ears (a well-known no-no), the relationship between the magician and the gold-digging girl, and the ending. My husband is a professional magician, and he laments the lack of popularity for the craft in our area; however, a real magician constantly improves his work, adds to his illusions, and never, never gives up. This movie made the magician seem like he didn't really care that much about his profession. He was able to work sometimes, so he should not have given up. For a movie we looked forward to seeing for quite a while, we were very disappointed and kind of depressed.

With The Illusionist on the Oscar race, perhaps it's a good time to finally review it. I've never seen a movie by Jacques Tati and I wonder how much that has affected my complete enjoyment of this movie, which is based on an original screenplay by him and whose protagonist, the magician Tatischeff, is patterned after his mannerisms and physical appearance. Although this dimension of the movie will elude me until I discover the Tati's work, I can still say that Sylvain Chomet's The Illusionist is one of the best movies of 2010.

I've been thinking about it since I saw it, in the last days of December, trying to understand what makes it so incredible; the movie took me for a roller-coaster of emotions and the finale broke my heart. And it did it with economy and subtlety. Perhaps the greatest trick this movie plays is being so simple. It has no dialogue, no famous actors loaning their voices to the characters. Its quality is intangible, impossible to pinpoint.

Tatischeff, a travelling French illusionist in the '50s, plies his trade all over Europe, going, always with his irascible rabbit, wherever people will hire him to perform his magic tricks. Business isn't doing very well, though, because of new competing forms of entertainment  in one hilarious sequence Chomet shows the illusionist having to wait on the backstage for a Beatles-inspired rock band to finish their act before he can get on stage. There's a feeling of an era fading away in this movie; a running theme is the demise of the old vaudeville performers: magicians, clowns, puppeteers, acrobats, etc., living in cheap hotels, unemployed, prone to suicide and alcoholism. Tatischeff belongs to a breed that wanes mentally and emotionally before dying physically.

Finding it harder and harder to go, he finds a new reason to live when he meets Alice, a maid working at a Scottish hotel. He takes her under her wing and takes her with her in his travels. Chomet makes it pretty clear that nothing sexual goes on between the two. Their relationship is of a father taking care of a daughter. For her he sacrifices everything he has to make her happy. In the end he even sacrifices his magic tricks and sense of wonder. He gets jobs to support her but his ineptitude for anything practical becomes apparent in many humorous gags. He tries to combine magic with advertising only for his love for magic to wither. As he becomes disillusioned, Alice grows into an independent woman who finds happiness without him. She seems to get more out of him that he out of her. He doesn't judge or blame her. His sacrifices, which can't be explained with mere altruism, finally make sense in the end.

Chomet's animated movie creates and develops in 80 minutes and without words two unique personalities that we grow attached to immediately. There's something wrong when an emotionless, exposition-heavy movie like Inception gets nominated for Best Original Screenplay and this movie, told only with the strength of images, doesn't. It was David Mamet who said that "a good film script should be able to do completely without dialogue." The Illusionist does just that and creates two characters I considered more real and cared more for than a few flesh and blood characters from Christopher Nolan's 148-minute-long movie.

However has watched Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville knows that this French animator continues to work with old-fashioned hand-drawn animation and that he mixes it with a personal style that oscillates between the poetic and the bizarre. Chomet is not a slave to realism but nevertheless his incursions into the nostalgic and the melancholy reveal fascinating nuances about the human condition, touching upon guilt, self-punishment and the need for redemption.

There's little more to say except that, Biutiful and Shutter Island notwithstanding, The Illusionist has the year's most heartbreaking ending. The ending, after an hour of humour and human sentiments, is a punch in the gut, a relentless attack on the wonder and imagination that make our lives more bearable. I withstood the hopeless bleakness of Biutiful, I sympathised with DiCaprio's need to punish himself in Shutter Island. But how can one cope with a movie that, hiding behind an innocent old-fashioned animation style, contains this horrifying conclusion: 'Magicians don't exist.' This is a card Tatischeff writes for Alice in the movie's final moments. A movie  of all things a movie, and animated to boot  saying this is like a cruel joke of vicious cynicism.

We all go through life suspecting this may be true, pushing it back into the recesses of our mind like thoughts about death, but when we speak it out loud the world suddenly becomes a dreary and colourless and unbearable place. Who would want to live in a world without magicians? Why live at all? If they don't exist, and I don't mean just magicians in the restricted sense, but all those magicians who invent stories, write books, make movies, all those wonderful entertainers who, in their own way, have something of the old vaudeville and traditional forms of entertainment; if they don't exist, I repeat, if there's no one to make our lives more special and bearable through tricks and illusions then what is life? And what's it good for? Is it just pain and misery, like Biutiful wants us to believe? Although heartbroken Tatischeff may believe that, Sylvain Chomet, a great magician in his own right, proves, with this movie, the opposite. Magicians exist and The Illusionist is one of the most beautiful and elegant magic tricks played on audiences in a long time.

The animation was technically superb, the characters well drawn (no pun intended), the scenery and settings were well chosen.

But this doesn't compensate for the fact that the story is dull, clichéd, mostly predictable and above all it's boring to the extent that it took me three days to sit through it because I simply lost interest in these cardboard cutout characters.

I see that most of the reviews are from people who live in Edinburgh and attended the IEFF premier. I can definitely understand the ratings given that the film is beautiful and set in the place where you live. I'm always swayed to give high ratings to films that depict Prague in the best possible light so have no complaints there.

I'm no fan of the MTV generation's three second attention span, and no fan of Michael Bay's assault on the senses type malarkey, but this film has no real substance. Its view on life harks back to a time where nuance and gentility were revered and admired, so although we would all (well me for a start) would love this to still be the case, it just isn't.

So for fans of escapism with a looong attention span and a love for Tati and Edinburgh, then this will probably work for you.

For me it was overlong, largely boring, facile and ultimately dull.

Cheers, Will

I would not have heard about this film if it did not earn one of only three slots in the race for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Previously, Oscar favorably introduced me to the fantastic "The Secret of Kells" via a surprise nomination last year. So I felt sure I also wanted to watch this film as well.

First comment would definitely be the look. The artwork had a very old and even faded feel to them. The characters themselves were not drawn in an attractive or memorable way. Second, the dialog, if you can call it that, was nothing more than indistinct mumbling in a foreign language with no subtitles. This was basically a silent film, as the story was told more by actions and not words. With these two characteristics alone, you know that this film would not really appeal to younger viewers who have grown up only knowing about the bright colors, cute characters and sassy dialogs of Disney and Pixar. 

Which brings us to the story. The titular "Illusionist" is a lonely old vaudeville-style magician who travels around getting whatever gig he can get, from dingy theaters to house parties just to earn his living. Once in a remote Scottish village, he he impresses a young servant girl by "magically" giving her a pair of red shoes. Fascinated, the girl packs up and follows him, joining him to his next gig in the city. She would wish for something (like a stylish coat or stiletto shoes she sees in store windows) and he would try to preserve the illusion of magic by "conjuring" it up (even if it means taking up odd jobs on the side). Of course, you simply know he can't keep up this arrangement for very long.

The whole movie is about an hour and 15 minutes long, but I think it would have worked better as a short film. The feeling of loneliness and melancholy pervades the whole film from beginning to end. The humorous bits are very few and far between, and sometimes too black for comfort. Ultimately, the very slow pace, turgid storytelling, lame comedy and lackluster presentation makes this ultimately unsatisfying. I felt it did not do anything new or exciting to the field of film animation that would make it deserving of that coveted 3rd slot in the Oscar shortlist.
