### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.

Some annoying kids find a map (Goonies)  including a fat kid who likes to eat (Goonies)  and they come up against the military which is trying to track down an alien on the loose (E.T.).

The creature has created issues for the townsfolk who express concern at a meeting with the sheriff (Jaws) and they eventually have to evacuate because of a made-up disaster (Close Encounters).

The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E.T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). One of the kids has a seemingly useless obsession that winds up helping to save the day in a climactic sequence (fireworks here and inventions in the Goonies) however the creature is much too smart to fall for such a trick (Jaws - "he's either very smart or very stupid"). An old guy, who is an expert on this creature (Jaws) winds up dying while the army shoots through the town and tanks roll (War of the Worlds).

Then the characters put the story together in one long expositional scene and we are not really sure how they figured it all out (Minority Report). It seems the monster is really a misunderstood good guy (Goonies) who makes a connection with our hero (ET, Close Encounters) and then flies home (E.T), but not before a lot of missing people are returned (Close Encounters) and lots of appliances fly around (Poltergeist).

The End.

As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.

Let's just hope that the future is filled with something in rare supply: originality.

It's not that I wasn't entertained, it's just that I expected something more.

And I suppose that's another problem with getting older. There aren't as many surprises left in the world.

I don't make movies or review them. I am simply someone who loves going to the movies and have seen more than I can count. I was waiting for Super 8 for about 6 months. I saw the early trailers, was involved in the viral campaigns. I was amped to go and experience another great JJ Abrams film. 

Like many reviewers I started on a high then at about half way my opinion of the movie had gone down a lot. 

I watch a lot of movies and like to think I know a good movie when I see one. For me it's simple. Was it interesting? Was it entertaining? Was it original? This is what makes a great movie to me. Super 8 was not a great movie.

The best way to describe Super 8 is take ET and put it in a blender with Cloverfield. But it just doesn't feel like it blended how it should have.

The are too main stories...little kids having adventures, growing up and falling in love. Other the other side a monster attacks the city cloverfield style. The kid parts are filmed in a very ET 80's cinemas style. The alien parts are modern with CGI and at times it honestly doesn't feel like you are watching the same film. 

Don't even get me started on inconsistencies of this movie... like a man driving into a speeding train derailing it and SURVIVING? lol... seriously?

Super 8 feels very much like a fan made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't quite work. 

I will say the kids were excellent actors and I would have been more entertained just watching a movie about them with no alien. Elle Fanning out acted every one, even the adult cast. She proved to be an amazing young actress portraying a maturity far beyond her age. But with the other characters I had no real emotional attachment to them. I didn't feel sorry for the alien, was I supposed to? 

Like I said I am simply a movie buff and to me this was not anything special. I'm surprised by all these 10/10 reviews, because this movie had nothing new that you haven't seen in 50 other films. I think it would have made 2 great separate films, where they could have taken their time to build the story. Combined though I would say wait for DVD.

The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. 

The acting was very convincing and drawing although the movie suffers from its mediocre ending. A few times I felt that the logic and the flow of the plot were a bit unrealistic and artificial. I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and one-dimensional minor characters. 

After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart-fluttering. It flings us back to the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time of our childhood. If you are into tantalizing sci-fi thrillers like this movie, I recommend 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' as your summer read.

I have never seen a movie which could be divided to two parts of "absolutely amazing" and "boring and childish". The first 80 minutes is awesome, I was shocked by how good this movie was as I had seen some bad reviews on IMDb but then the cheesy part kicked in and ruined the whole thing. 

First thing that comes in to everybody's mind when they see the first scenes is that this movie is so similar to et! The style is the same, the theme is the same, it even happens in the same era with the same kind of neighborhood which is kinda cool and nostalgic for my generation. Super 8 seems like a fan-made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't work quite well. 

From the actor's performance perspective; Elle Fanning's performance was breath-taking, and she saved some scenes. She's got potential to be a big star in the future. Kyle Chandler on the other hand was just plain and simple awful. He made the whole thing look kinda funny and stupid. 

From special effects and sounding perspective, I'd say it was stunning. One of the best I have seen in the genre in years as you would expect when you see Spielberg's name on the screen. There's this big scene at the first half an hour into the movie where you just get nailed to your sit due to the load sound which should have been annoying but it was not. It was awesome. You don't see this in Germany often but after this specific scene, the audience gave Abram an standing ovation!!! It was awesome. Of course at the end, everyone was angry because he ruined the whole thing with a very cheesy "et-like" ending but all in all it was worth the money, better than most of the movies in the last 6 months, I would say. 

I'm giving it 6/10 because first of all, I expected so much more from the creator of Lost and second of all, the last 30 minutes is really bad and the ending is just pure garbage. They used some cgi stuff which was very impressive but didn't quite go with the theme of the movie and was really inconsistent. All in all, it doesn't deserve the crap that it's getting in the reviews but it quite doesn't deserve the praises either. It's only OK

I created an account just so I could do my duty as a citizen of the world and warn others not to see this horrid piece of garbage called super 8. Save yourself 2 hours of life and 8 bucks and do anything else.

Here is the plot summary: a group of annoying kids (with the squeaky- obnoxious-puberty voice) are trying to make a movie. They witness a train wreck and capture an alien on camera. They run around for 70 minutes yelling profanities and telling each other to "shut up". Dogs run away. Lights flicker. The military gets involved. There are numerous explosions. The alien is going to eat people. The main kid tells the alien through a psychic connection "you can survive hard times" and the alien builds a spaceship and leaves. 

Very slow moving, nothing ties together. Extremely BOOOOOORRRING.

As mentioned by others, the characters are like those from "The Goonies" and "The Sandlot". To make this movie: Take the token fat kid, small annoying blonde kid, nerdy kid with glasses, and a normal kid and throw them into "War of the Worlds", give them fireworks and watch what happens. 

The end of this movie is very similar to "Knowing"... yeah...

Overall, the movie was just plain awful. I honestly do not know how any reasonable human being could give this movie an 8/10.

Although I could create an extensive list of cliché one-liners, obvious inconsistencies, and totally unrealistic occurrences (even for a PG-13 sc-fi movie), the underlying reason that I will influence friends to not see this movie is because the plot was weak and shallow.

First of all, there are actually 4 subplots that a viewer has to juggle between!

1) A budding romantic relationship between the two main (middle school) characters 2) Mending a tense father-child relationship(s) (also with both main characters) 3) A group of early teens helping the alien return home and... 4) A son finding a way to cope with the loss of his mother *I might not have deemed 4) as a plot line if it wasn't for the intentionally-dramatic "letting the alien take mom's locket" scene as the last scene in the movie*

These plots were all given fairly even amounts of attention and while they did have some connecting, because there is not much screen-time or time dedicated to deepen dialogue within the individual plots, they all come off as unimportant.

While it does have a fair amount of suspense, the action sequences are typical at best.

Overall, just a flat-out poor showing by high profile names (and a $45m budget).

Like I mentioned in the beginning sentence, there are so many things that just don't make any sense. But the biggest question I had walking away is why did the Air Force end up killing Dr. Woodward??? There was no reason for his murder whatsoever! (Not considering the fact that he was still alive after a head-on collision with a speeding freight train). It's almost funny how drastic that decision was by the "evil Air Force Sargent," Nelec.

This movie wants to take you on a ride, it wants to take you back to a time and a place where the world was that little more innocent.

This movie wants your heart to skip a beat when danger is near, and wants you to lose your breath when the heroes are in peril. 

This movie wants to be a lot of things, but ultimately there's just something missing. You feel like a spectator just waiting to get involved, but as the movie creeps along and goes through the motions you begin to realize that the sidelines are as close as you're going to get.

There's virtually no back story to what's on board the train and when do finally learn more about it it's then too late to care. The father and son have both been impacted by a traumatic and life-changing event, but aside from a few passing encounters we don't ever really feel their pain. 

There are some moments in the movie that stir something deeper down, but they're over almost as quickly as they begun and you're back to the bleachers watching a fairly boring, simple story unfold. 

I think what is at fault here is the plot - it's seemingly non-existent. The director has taken a bunch of things that on their own sound like a great recipe, but some vital magic got missed from the mix and it just never comes together like it should.

I went into the theater having heard some Luke warm to bad reviews but was unphased. What do the critics know. The movie starts of kind of slow, with a lot of unexplained tension and drama that is later explained but never really makes much sense. The set up of the lead kids mom dying and it being the drunk father of the female hottie's fault is elaborate but does little for the movie. 

At the end of the movie as the alien is trying to get away, he is at the same time causing the armies tanks and weapons to go crazy, launching tank shells and mortars all over the town. You don't see any of those kill anyone but they do enormous destruction and probably kill a larger number of people. Yet the music is triumphant and we are supposed to feel good for the alien. "Yay he was imprisoned for 20 years, that gives him the moral high ground to destroy a town and kill whoever he likes. The US government is bad!" Umm sure, this movie has some identity issues.

The kids characters were just awful charactertures. I wanted to vomit each time one of them showed up on screen again. 

Finally got to love the simply awful physics. What happens when a 3000 ton train hits a 2 ton truck? Most of the time the truck gets flattened and the train moves on without slowing or any damage. Even if the train had been derailed, it likely would have just slowly ground to a halt. Cars would not fly through the air. The twisted wreckage and explosions were just Hollywood playing with themselves and their 45 MILLION dollar production cost. Seriously this movie could have been made twice as good for one tenth the cost. Ever watched the end of "Back to the Future 3" It works pretty much like that, except with the Delorian being replaced with a truck

The concept of "Super 8" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about "Super 8" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing.

"Super 8" is another intriguing monster movie by J.J. Abrams. Yes, you really wanna know what it looks like but I'm not gonna tell you. The sad thing is it's not as intriguing as Cloverfield. But It's easy to ignore that problem because there is something better than being another Cloverfield. It feels like you are watching a good old classic movie. Great characters, Good old fashion score, and kids intrigued by the situation.

The story is really about the characters' zombie movie making and the family tragedy while there's a monster attacking their town. The monster is like the background or the subplot of this film. But the movie still got suspense. The movie is indeed beautiful and plenty of heart. The movie is just nostalgic stuff. It's not trying to be new. It just wants to show how J.J. Abrams is inspired by Steven Spielberg's movies.

There are some amazing scenes in this film. Example, the train collision was breathtaking. The movie sure has a lot of humor. It's like a relic to the old family movies. The CGI is good enough. The performances were good. The kids gave a lot of personality to their roles.

"Super 8" is a J.J. Abrams film with Spielberg's trademarks all over it. It's not a blockbuster that has a lot of action and less talking. This movie is made in old fashion style. Yep, this movie is nostalgic if you saw Spielberg's old movies and it's good to see another one like it.

Note: There is something interesting in the credits. You might wanna check it out.

Wish there was a 0 rating. The movie was absolutely awful, how many times will directors try to stuff ugly alien with amazing technology down our throat.Very slow narration and build up. Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart.

I remember being only one of the handful of people in Budapest who wanted to see this film in original version (i.e. English audio, no subtitles) on one hot Friday evening in the summer of 2011. It is a shame everything gets dubbed in cinemas in Hungary these days. Nevertheless, it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.

The movie takes place in 1979, if I am not mistaken. As one could expect from Mr Spielberg the era is presented meticulously. Movie posters here and there, kid listening to his Walkman, old cars driven on the streets and of course the children trying to shoot their dream movie with the use of a Super 8 camera.

I do not remember when was the last time I saw children acting superbly. Although the main character's father, the deputy in the town, has a vital role, as well, he is not in the focus and we are more interested in seeing the kids' struggle to finish the film even after the derailment of a train and the subsequent appearance of the US Air Force.

I am not lying to you: I was afraid Spielberg would not be enough to make it a successful movie and J.J Abrams would only mess up the story. If you think about it: Cloverfeld meets the Extra Terrestrial? Come on!

Yet, it works! It is a wonderful piece of work which, yes, most of the time reminds us of the small alien who wanted to go home but it's been almost 30 years since then so should it really be a concern that someone tries to borrow elements from a successful movie?

I was stuck to my seat the whole time and was eagerly waiting for the end of a wonderful journey. If you did not like the trailer there is no point in ruining your evening. However, if you did like it and E.T. was something that makes you remember your childhood vividly, give it a try, you will not regret it!

I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Well done, guys! Hope to see the result of your further cooperation sometime in the future.

I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams, some of his stuff I like, some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved. 

In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. It was like ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot. And the film that they are trying to make within the film, and their obsession with "production values" draws a lot of laughs. 

The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. 

Now, as much as I loved the film, it is not without some flaws, mostly in continuity. Also, I would have liked a little more exposition for some of the characters, I would love to know more about Alice's father. That being said, I am forgiving on those things because the movie hits its mark everywhere else. 

Surely it will draw its comparisons to ET, and the other early Spielberg works, but those comparisons will always be unfair. Those films came at a different time. And the people who see Super 8 today, have changed since they first saw ET, or any of those other films. I am just glad the generation of younger people will have this as a generational film for them, as I had with those other great adventure films. 

All in all, Super 8 was a terrific film experience, that will leave you with a smile on your face.

It has been pretty much commented that Super 8 is a tribute to the classic films directed or produced by Steven Spielberg, in which the ordinary life in the suburbs was contrasted with an extraordinary phenomenon which had to be usually faced by the kids or teenagers, while the adults ignored the situations until it was too late. In that aspect, director and screenwriter J.J. Abrams achieved exactly what he proposed to himself, even though he had to sacrifice any trace of originality or surprise in the film. However, Super 8 kept me very entertained because of its solid direction, excellent performances and well written screenplay. In summary, this film is an exciting juvenile adventure seasoned with wide doses of "Spielbergian" nostalgia.

If we analyze Super 8 scene by scene, we can find an alarming number of parallels to films like The Goonies, Poltergeist, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and specially, E.T. The subject from Super 8 is superficially different, but the characters, atmosphere and tone perfectly emulate the "Spielberg style" from the '70s and the '80s, when his films (either as a director or producer) literally changed the face of popular cinema. Even the young actors from Super 8 possess that chemistry with each other which makes us to accept their long friendship and related personalities...even though that, as in any group of friends, they occasionally have juvenile disputes with each other.

And besides of the perfect chemistry they have with each other, the young actors also make a brilliant individual work, highlighting Joel Courtney, Ryan Lee and specially Elle Fanning. After the works she brought in Somewhere and Super 8, Fanning reveals herself as a great actress who is even superior to her famous sister Dakota. The moment in which her performance in Super 8 most impressed me was during a scene of "performance into performance" which is so good that it equals the one interpreted by Naomi Watts in Mulholland Dr. (I am not exaggerating). As for the adult cast, the only one who stands out is Kyle Chandler, who makes a solid work as a simultaneously benevolent and strict father.

On the negative side, the screenplay from Super 8 falters a little bit in some important points. Abrams dominates the drama and the growing suspense very well, but he occasionally violates the internal logic from the story or forces too convenient situations. Nevertheless, Super 8 is a very good film which definitely deserves a recommendation because of the genuine talent it has in front of and behind the camera.

*** Might Contain Spoilers ***

I don't understand how such a horrible movie is getting rave reviews here. The acting was terrible, the camera work even worse. The plot? Please... It's like another attempt as E.T. but this one came up way short. The story is completely unoriginal. The scenes of things blowing up and car wrecks were well done, but, come on, take a train head on and survive? Ridiculous... 

I was completely bored. Just seemed like the whole movie was pieced together by kids trying to make a movie, quite frankly. The movements of the creature were jerky and poorly rendered. The creature's existence on Earth was never really explained.

Yeah, things go flying through the air and the train wreck looks great in 3D, but that's about where the good moments end with this movie. Honestly feel that the trailer was better than the whole movie.

Don't waste your time...

The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds.

Wow, I really, really wanted to like this movie. I had mixed expectations going in. On the one hand, I expected a typical Spielberg style kids vs. monster type flick, on the other, I have been disappointed by Abrams before with Cloverfield.

So, for the first three quarters of the movie, I was actually enjoying the ride. At least this time, Abrams managed to make characters that I could care about. I was able to suspend my disbelief and go along in spite of many problems with physics and continuity. As the story went on, the unexplained bits and pieces of the plot began to wear thin.

Basically, if you read the negative reviews on here you will see the problems with this film; the complete rehashing of so many Spielberg clichés, multiple goofy continuity problems, and poor plot exposition and so on. I actually could have overlooked most of this for the positives, if it weren't for the particularly flat ending.

The rest of the film had enough great production values, character development and a great feeling of an old time 50's monster movie I really was having fun, until it got toward the end. They just couldn't pull all the plot elements together in a satisfying way. Worst yet, the ending fell totally flat. Where there should have been some tension building with a good climactic scene, it just kind of ended, plop, that was it, very unsatisfying.

I don't understand the trend with filmmakers like Abrams, Shyamalan and a others these days. There is a tendency to have characters with strong but contrived story lines, where the plot exposition is so minimal and choppy that it is difficult to actually develop an emotional connection with them. Then, it is difficult to tell where some of their motivation comes from. Ultimately, these characters act in ways that seem inappropriate under the circumstances. Anyway, I just tire with this kind of half-ass story telling. These guys need to watch some classic Hitchcock, Lumet, Reiner etc. and get some tips on plot and character development.

Bummer, this was so close to being a really good movie, if not great, it just needed better storytelling and a decent ending.

That's the movie in a few words, in 1979 (I think people have to guess it because in one of the kids rooms there is a poster for Halloween, a much better movie and on a grave it says 1979) kids film a movie where the person in charge, instead of trying to tell a story the kid seems more interested in production value, and then once shooting a scene at a train station because a train is coming and the kid wants production value and a truck hits the train and the kids run away and... after a whole lot of fake CGI effects (the people that liked this movie might've cared but all I thought was "another explosion? more debris? when will this end?"... might make a decent episode out of Mythbusters though) then what happens the kids regroup in the aftermath, and I find it hard to believe that the height of injury is scraped knees they go to the truck that hit it, I find it even more hard to believe is that it had a head-on-collision with a train and the guy survives with only a few scars.

The guy who was supposed to be dead in the car tells the kids "do not talk about this to anyone" ... In the movie he's talking to these kids of who were supposed to be asleep when it's nearly 1 o'clock in the morning and pulls out a gun in perfect condition the kids run and the guy shoots through what was the windshield and the kids go home and say nothing about it. Over on some gas station a sheriff is at a gas station and while getting fuel for the car the sheriff gets sucked in by something which later turns out to be a monster and the monster throws the sheriff back at it's car, the clerk finally notices and exits and couldn't find him (did he try looking under the car?). later a kid's father who is a cop gets about 50,000 reports of missing dogs and people, later they find the dogs but outside the town.

I will not go any further explaining in great detail about the plot but the movie was not a good movie. The ending felt totally out of place with what happened with the past 2 hours you sit through, a monster/alien kidnaps people from a town, holds them in terror, kills a few random people... and in the end the monster constructs a spaceship and flies off with music as if we should've felt something for the alien.

2 things I found wrong with that explanation of the ending, an alien using a few small metallic objects creates a fully functional spaceship capable of flying, secondly there is this music playing as if we should've felt something for the alien but I didn't.

Overall, If anyone wanted to see a good alien movie of this year then I'd suggest Paul.

Found it hard to believe this movie got high reviews. I love Scify, but except for a couple funny lines I was bored stiff. Took my wife with me and her comment was that this was the most stupid movie she has seen. 

I saw X-men and thought that was great, but don't waste your money on this one. 

Sure the special effects were great, but these days you come to expect about the same in most movies of this type. The movie may be liked more by the younger crowd, but the mature audience will see a boring movie with a simple, silly plot. I went to see Super 8 because of the reviews, but will be a little more cautious in the future.

JJ Abrams lends his Cloverfield monster to Steven Speilburg to be tamed by 12 year old smart a$$es. Really can't stand movies where kids are supposed to be so much more insightful than the adults and they make an organization like the US Air Force look like Ghadiffi's crack team of governmental control.

The monster changes sizes from humongous to bouncing around inside the bus. 

Why was the alien hanging the humans in his cave? Why don't the humans wake up when the alien grabs them in his huge claw, but the girl wakes up when she is slapped by the candy wipe boy? Why does the army keep firing their weapons when they don't work and fly into their own forces? Why didn't the alien breakout of the train before the crash? How did the "Doctor teacher" survive the train/truck wreck ( I mean c'mon that truck would have been a flattened, charred ball of smash)?

100 more logic questions waiting to be asked/answered.

I really wanted to love this movie. Having grown up in the 80's blessed with so many classic Spielberg movies the thought him making one with JJ Abrahams was tantalizing. Unfortunately, it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies, Jaws, Close encounters, ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost / Cloverfield (which I love) mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching, funny, kids Spielberg movie with a confusing, alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before, I know what's going to happen next, it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better, The Goonies was a classic, ET was a classic, Close Encounters was a classic, Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!

In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of "worshipping" Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.

But Abrams somehow manages to do this without completely sacrificing his own unique voice as a filmmaker. It's got the twists and turns of Lost, the personality of his Star Trek, and, like most Abrams projects, a leading lady who propels the whole thing. In this case, it's young Elle Fanning, who, as Alice, projects such a genuine combination of childlike innocence and ahead of her years maturity, that you can't take her eyes off of her whenever she's on screen. The entire cast is terrific, especially Joel Courtney as Joe, and Riley Griffiths as Charles, but Fanning steals the movie. We become completely involved with these characters in a way we rarely do with adult Hollywood heroes. I found myself caring every bit as much about the budding romance between Alice and Joe as I did the more spectacular events of the film.

And it is spectacular. Abrams and Spielberg give us action/suspense scenes that evoke Spielberg's classics Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. They also come as close to the emotion of E.T. as any film of this type has done since then. Super 8 is the kind of film for which the cliché "You''ll laugh, you'll cry" was invented. If you're a child of the 80s and complain that they don't make movies the way they did when you were a kid, well, Abrams and Spielberg have done exactly that.And Michael Giacchino further establishes himself as one of the best film composers to come along in years. His score soars with emotions and build suspense in the vein of (of course) John Williams.

I also have to take a moment, as former amateur child filmmaker, to talk about how well rendered that aspect of the story is. It certainly added an extra level of enjoyment for me that I vividly remember the days of trying to make my own blockbusters with nothing but a camera, a few friends, and wildly overactive imagination.

It's worth mentioning, by way of warning (especially to parents) that Super 8 is rated PG-13 for a reason, namely the intensity, and for an E.T./Goonies like tendency to have the kids swear. Most audiences will get past this, but certainly some will not, and I'm absolving myself of any complaints. 

Movies like this are the reason I love movies. In an age when trailers give away everything, Super 8 unfolds before us, capturing us in its spell, and never letting go. It's an unforgettable movie experience. A film to be treasured,

I wanted to give this film an 8. As the film went on, I was giving it a 7, then a five, and finally I settled with a 4. It's sad because this is one of those movies that I anticipated for a year now and I can't believe this was the result.

If this is what to expect in the celluloid graveyard of summer movies, then we're in trouble. The concept had potential, and it's enough for me to give them my ten dollars. The first act also sets up potential, but unfortunately the actual story tears this film down. The actual story was also a kept secret by the filmmakers. It's not because it's going to shock you, it's because they were embarrassed of the end result.

It's about a bunch of kids with a Super 8 camera trying to make a movie for a film festival (which is forgotten about in the third act), when suddenly a train derails and explosions happen all around them. The explosion is caused by their science teacher named Old Man Woodward. But then the military gets involved, and the kids take off with this rubix cube.

Yeah, there's a bunch of rubix cubes that the military confiscates and the main kid has it in his room. It, like the Super 8 camera itself, never feels like the focus of the film as it is busy establishing that the town is in fear and the kid's deputy dad is trying to fix things, and the relationship with the main kid and this girl Alice. Apparently, their dads don't want them to see each other and it becomes a child love story. 

As the film drones on, it becomes worse and worse. Be prepared to hear the kids constantly yelling, "What's going on?" and "What's happening?" over and over. In the third act, the film derails like the train in the beginning as if the writer's experience writer's block but they just kept writing stuff just to get the script done. Everything starts to feel scripted and formulaic. There's also a moment between kid and alien that felt so out of place, and utterly ridiculous that it gets even worse right to the closing credits.

As of this writing, I regretfully hail Super 8 as the worst movie of the summer. It saddens me because I was so eager to see this, and so sure that it was going to be great, that I hate to end the summer movie season by listing this as the worst. It's still early, and a crop full of movies to go. Super 8, unfortunately, is far from being super.

Super 8 was the worst movie I have seen in the whole year! I really don't understand all of the media hype surrounding this movie. This movie reminded me of a bad "X-Files" episode. The first hour is full of very boring dialog. The group of children spend the hour crying about not having enough film for their stupid home movie. I just couldn't stand watching these kids make home movies for the first hour of the movie. I kind of felt like taking a nap. The whole plot is explained and wrapped up in the last 25 minutes of the movie. So you wouldn't miss anything if your arrived very late to the theater. This movie has some ideas from "Close encounters, The Goonies, and ET" also a little bit of a bad "X-Files" episode thrown in. Don't wasted your money.

This film has wonderful production values and excellent acting. However, it is totally derivative and predictable. I expected much more from Abrams and Spielberg. I can only guess that all of the reviews giving this 9s and 10s were written by 14-year-olds. There is absolutely no suspense. Rather the film goes for shocks - often. Val Lewton first discovered this technique in Cat People and it has been known ever after as a "bus". To be effective a bus has to be completely unexpected. Super 8's buses can be seen coming down the street for several blocks. The plot is completely unbelievable. The monster digs a pit and miles of tunnels in one day. I believed this could be done by a flying saucer when Invaders from Mars scared the wits out of me in 1953. But a single monster? And one that could attract tons of metal and magically turn it into a space ship? (Did anyone notice that while the kid's locket was being attracted to the water tower a background character had a necklace that wasn't?) Yet the monster couldn't escape from a box car? And don't get me started on the train wreck. Exciting - sure. But totally breaking the laws of physics. It is impossible for a truck to derail a locomotive on a straightaway. The truck would simply be pushed down the track for however long it took for the engineer to stop the train. And even if the loco derailed the rest of the train wouldn't act like a speeding bullet. Let's just sum it up by saying the great films are able to make you suspend your disbelief even over the most incredible events. Super 8 fails, making it only a so-so film.
