The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washington's Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained, but with ever-building intensity, Washington turns in another stellar performance. 

Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teenage prostitute, is a force...

Antoine Fuqua, the directer who brought us Training Day, which earned Denzel his Best Actor Oscar, helms this movie with a steady hand. His direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly, drawing us into the complexity of this character-driven piece. 

Robert McCall keeps to himself, content to live his ordinary life; he is every man's man. But, his steady moral compass, and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray. This character is not infallible, and he is not looking for trouble. He just wants what's right. 

This film is a superbly acted, exciting and violent ride! In the pursuit of justice, there will be blood. But this time, you'll be rooting for the good guy, and I, a fifty years young woman, loved every minute of it!

Antoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip- roaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department.

Some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical, run-of-the-mill, action movie, nothing you haven't seen before....nothing could be farther from the truth!! 

This movie is based off the television series called "The Equalizer". It is about an ex-CIA operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse. This movie version of The Equalizer is more reminiscent of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick. In fact, in Mr. Damon's own words, The Equalizer "...reminded me of the Bourne Identity, in that both are sophisticated adult, thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of high-action exploits, but aren't running around in spandex." Directed by the great Antoine Fuqua, the man who brought us Training Day, The Equalizer is a gritty and violent, suspenseful and superb action film. This movie is very character-driven, and Denzel Washington, who plays protagonist Robert McCall, gives another stellar performance. His character lives alone, keeps to himself, and seems to suffer from some form of OCD. Most importantly, McCall is not McClane! He is not a wise-cracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, but rather a quiet and complex character, whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten. 

This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects. However, the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of it's R- rating, and create this film's authentic feel. The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. Team Washington/Fuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times, and one you will cheer on every step of the way!!!

Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.

Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.

Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).

While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and Léon: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say  Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer.

At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, "He'll be killed," "She'll be kidnapped and used as bait," "Something bad's gonna happen to him," and my all-time favorite, "He's the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we'll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown." And every prediction is spot-on.

Example of bad writing: Two thugs walking up to a door. The last thing Thug 2 says to Thug 1 as they approach the door, "Whatever you do, don't call him Little John." Very next shot, inside the door, Thug 1 starts talking smack... and guess what he does? When the setup is literally 5 seconds earlier, we all see it coming. Give us the setup in a different location, maybe? Or at least disguise the setup amidst a longer, funny/entertaining conversation? Nope, just lay out that one line setup, then walk on in. We the viewers will just deal with it.

Denzel's character is likable. I mean, insanely likable. Beyond the depth of my willful suspension of disbelief likable. He's always friendly, always in a good mood, always smiling. He's ecstatic just to be alive. Everyone loves being near him. He's never "just a guy." He's more helpful than a college professor, more inspirational than a priest, more motivational that a fitness instructor. Every scene in his workplace (which is visited repeatedly throughout the movie) includes no less than 2 background guys smiling giddily when Denzel arrives to work, and laughing loud at every word Denzel speaks. Going to work at Home Depot - sorry, "Home Mart" - surely isn't like that in real life.

But there's more to Denzel, isn't there? Who is this guy? Where'd he come from? Who knows? We'll never know. But clearly he's bad-ass. More moves than Shakira and deadlier than Seal Team Six. He seems to know how to handle any situation and any number of attackers - just because. No reason; he's just awesome. If you ever saw the classic comedy PLANET TERROR, just think of the scene, "Give him the gun. Give him all the guns." Because, ya know, he's just so bad-ass for no logical reason.

The bad guy was awesome. While Denzel's fight scenes were a lot of super-close blurry shots, the few scenes where the Bad Guy establishes his badness were rather good, very tense, very violent and cringe-worthy.

THE EQUALIZER has all latest bells and whistles with music, atmosphere, and build-up. The one female lead is developed nicely (especially compared to every other innocent victim who may as well have stepped out of Little House On The Prairie). Much of the movie is very tense, and keeps you hanging on to each scene, waiting to see what happens next. But ultimately, we all know Denzel will kick ass, so it's all just a waiting game. It felt very long. The wait is made so much worse when the viewer knows exactly what's coming. There's just no surprises here. You've seen this movie 500 times, I'm sure.

Oh yeah, and Denzel knows everything. He appears magically inside buildings and rooms where one shouldn't be able to sneak in. He has cell phone numbers one shouldn't have access to - the characters even comment on it, "How the hell did you get that number?!" No answer. Doesn't matter. It's a movie. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the tension building. How does Denzel know when the bad guys will appear at a time and place, so he can intercept them in the night? Don't know, doesn't matter, I guess. How does Denzel sneak into a closet-sized room without the occupant noticing? How does Denzel have time to set up his trap, rig wires, etc, without anyone seeing this work being done? Who cares, the resulting deaths are cool.

Go to sleep. Tune out. Enjoy. But don't expect to take this movie with you. You'll have forgotten it by the time you leave the parking lot.

Sorry Denzel, not even your amazing talent could save this laughably insultingly lame, simple-minded, patronizing movie straight from the mind of a toddler trapped in a 38 year old Hollywood screenwriter fantasizing about saving abused hookers from fat Russian mobsters. But 2 good things about this movie: 1) Denzel AND 2) Mustache twirling, bootleg Kenneth Branagh main villain.

And from this point on my review will simply be titled "Hollywood Thinks...."

1) Hollywood thinks that Russians speaking to each other randomly pepper-in English for some odd reason & then go back to their native language to say important info like "Yes"

2) Hollywood thinks every man only gets mad about injustice when it's a young attractive female who is being abused and beaten by rich, fat, ultra violent, mustache twirling foreigner/weirdos.

3) Hollywood thinks ex-CIA members go around wiping out entire crime families not because they want to stop crime or injustice to the general public, but because one white woman was abused by Russian pimp-mobsters who very obviously had done that type of thing to countless men/women before. But it is okay for the hero to murder people because, hey, they hit a woman & they are one-dimensional evildoers who don't deserve even a trial or gas chamber for their crimes, they deserve a vigilante death.

4) Hollywood thinks the Russian mafia and the Boston PD are both incompetent fools: These rocket scientists run around saying things like "no witnesses" but brashly brandish guns in broad daylight and shoot at things all the time out in public while doing faux-military hand- gestures thought up by the 5 year old screenwriter while playing Contra. And apparently half of the corrupt cops in this universe are making gobs of money with the oh-so-dangerous yet generic "mafia" groups while the other half is shaking down Mexican Jack Black's mom for pocket change at a taco stand because that's such a booming industry in the Southy Projects. Feed me to thah POOR by dah way.

5) Hollywood thinks an ex-CIA member can lecture mobsters about lying, killing, and insulting a government agency for corruption...as if they have such a squeaky clean record. And they also think we the idiot simpleton audience is supposed to shake in our boots at these tired, played out tropes revolving around the "RUSSIANS" and "CIA" and "CORRUPT COPS" who talk like caricatures from an unreleased Sopranos sub-plot. 

6) Hollywood thinks that every vigilante murder, destruction of property, torture, etc. can be written off as legitimate because said vigilante was an ex-CIA/FBI/Law enforcement officer with some current tie to an operational government contact (in this case a female instead of a male because that is just so out of the box & unexpected) So progressive this film.

7) Hollywood thinks they need to shoot everything in slow motion because MATRIX.

8) Hollywood thinks people with guns often give vigilantes 20 minutes of slow motion time to plan out killing them with random blunt or sharp objects just after adjusting skull-shaped items to foreshadow their doom.

9) Hollywood thinks the audience is stupid (and they may have a point) so constantly have characters yell out things like "OH THIS IS THE RING I LOST" and "OH MY GOD YOU DID IT!" because we idiots could not done figure that out oh golly geez and a wippdee doo!

10) Hollywood thinks by shooting people talking that are famous and telegraphing what is good and evil, over and over again with the same idiotic tropes, that it counts as great cinema. F**K Hollywood and F**K this movie.

Just when I thought Hollywood couldn't go lower, comes this masterpiece. I'm sad to see Washington agreeing to play this role which is way below his standard. I guess Uncle Sam payed him hefty dollars to take part in this political message to Russia. Long story short, Denzel (Obama) single-handedly, and with use of some home appliances, kills the entire Russian mob organisation including the boss in Russia, Vladimir Pushkin (Putin). He even blows up the gas pipeline (seriously?) The prostitutes represent Ukraine, that needs protection from big bad Russians. Uninventive, childish, crude, terribly written political propaganda. Avoid if you can.

Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.

Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.

And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?

As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches "blink-and-you-miss him" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).

If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.

The movie was action packed and I love when the good guy always win. The character don't talk much but you can only pull that off if you are a good actor. The young actress I hear she is 17 did an amazing job to play that part.Denzel no words you still got the box office power. My husband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one scene came up he gets a kick out of that stuff. Never seen the Equalizer series at all so my opinion is from the movie only. Sequel is wide open lets have more next year. Hope to see more. Love It. Hope the DVD be out for a Christmas Present for the husband I will be buying it. All I can say is go see this movie because it is very good don't listen to the haters.

The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.

There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.

The cool slow-mos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension, but put that aside, each action scene is watchable enough, we don't usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this. This is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces. Denzel Washington shifts his character to two personalities: one is the likable ordinary man himself and the anti-hero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world. The performance does sum up the overall movie, from gravitas to smugness, and what's great is they're both effective anyway. However, the villains (and their tattoos) have blatantly shown that they're evil: the main antagonist seems like he's written to be over-the-top, almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso, but Marton Csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it.

The Equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent, but I could guarantee that it still entertains, it does have the appeal through its action and acting. Though, there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller. The film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements, but it just keeps shifting back and forth, like we're not getting to the actual big picture. Well, if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience. For now, it can be endlessly watchable, but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it.

In 2003 while Denzel Washington was promoting his dumb but fun thriller Out of Time he gave an interview stating how it was nice to star in a film that didn't require him to do too much. Coming off the back of his 2002 Oscar win for Training Day, Washington didn't exactly sugar coat the idea that Out of Time was a pay check gig pure and simple. Since then Denzel's film choices have seemed littered with these quick cash movies. For every Man on Fire or Inside Man we get a Safe House or last year's forgettable 2 Guns. The Equalizer sees Washington re-team for the first time since 2002 with Training day Director Antoine Fuqua. Audience's hoping to see a return to form from the Training day duo maybe disappointed. The Equalizer feels like another pay check gig, it certainly is dumb it lacks any of the fun of Out of Time...And that movie stared Dean Cain.

The Equalizer is a remake in name only of the 80's television series of the same name. The show starred Edward Woodard as a retired government agent turned private detective. He spends each episode helping people similar to the A-team or Highway to Heaven. It was never a show I was practically aware of but it seemed to be stable Television for my parents growing up. The 2014 version sees Washington play Robert McCall, a mysterious quiet man who gets sucked back into his old violent ways while trying to help out a number of people in his life. These people include a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She is under the control of the Russian Mafia who doesn't take to kindly to their business being interrupted. If the plot synopsis sounds familiar it's because it's the basic premise for most Steven Segal movies or any action movie in the 80's. Don't get me wrong The Equalizer is far better than any Half Past Dead or Exit Wounds (maybe not Under Siege) but it is the first sign that this long awaited big screen Equalizer lacks any sort of Originality. Antoine Fuqua with the exception of Training Day has never really dazzled on the big screen. Films like Shooter and Tears of the Sun look the part but never really excite as action films. The Equalizer is no different. Long when it should be tight and loud when it should be quiet. The Equalizer is a bit like a spinning plate. It starts off straight before quickly wobbling then completely crashing to the ground. Fuqua and writer Richard Wenk should take the full brunt of this. The script feels like it should have undergone another re-write, you can feel every minute of the films 131 min running time. In an effort to include elements of the show Denzel finds himself helping multiple characters during the movies 2nd act. Great for them but this puts the main plot on hold killing all momentum. At one stage Washington leaves the film altogether to meet with old work friends (sorely underused Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman) for a scene that does not add to the story in any way. Elements are brought up but never go anywhere. It is eluded that his Character has OCD but this is never established and appears and re-appears at random. All this makes the film disjointed and adds to the already bloated running time.

At this point you could forgive all this because it is an action film and you paid to see Denzel kick ass and take names. Unfortunately Fuqua drops the ball in this department also. An initial confrontation with Russian heavies is well shot for maxim tension but quickly unravels once the action starts. The film feels like it's edited in an attempt to cut around some of the violence and this makes the fight scenes seem clunky. It doesn't help that it is so poorly let, a similar compliant that was leveled against Fuqua last film Olympus has fallen.

Denzel is always a watchable presence no matter what he is in and here it is no different. Unfortunately the screen play doesn't give him much of a character to work with. The story goes out of its way to keep his character a mystery, we learn next to nothing about him which makes it difficult to root for him. He just comes across as bored or uninterested. He does get some moments to shine and he is a warm presence in the his scenes with Chloe Grace Moretz. Moretz here is excellent in the role bringing a real vulnerability as a young Russian Call girl and the late night conversations they share about books (although very on the nose) are engaging. She brings a real heart to the film which is sadly lost when she is sidelined for the bulk of the running time. Without her Washington's character has no one to bounce off. He just becomes a bore. 

It would be easy to compare this film to Tony Scott's excellent Man on Fire and the marketing has gone to some length to draw a similarity between the two. Man on fire succeeded because Tony Scott was wise enough to spend an hour of the running time building a relationship between the two leads. Denzel's anger and revenge seems justified. In the Equalizer it feels like Fuqua skips through this stuff to get to the money shots. It's interesting that both films contain a shot of the lead character walking away from an Explosion, In Man on Fire it's a moment which signifies the storm that is to come and the level of violence he is willing to go to. In the Equalizer it's a hollow eye rolling moment thrown in just because it looks cool. It kind of sums up the whole film. (D)

Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.

The movie had a quiet tone similar to Denzel and Director Antoine Fuqua's last flick, Training Day, but Denzel's performance in this is far more Oscar worthy. Denzel still brings passion to movies in an age were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check, and basically that's what makes the movie. Watching Denzel on screen.

In all fairness, The Equalizer's main antagonist, A man the mob sends to take care of their problems, was no slouch either. It was so entertaining watching these two hunt each other down.

Possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough Chloë Grace Moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo.

Overall Mr. Fuqua directed the great Denzel in another amazing role.

In its introductory scenes The Equalizer is not a bad movie. However, once the plot gets underway it becomes one. Here is yet another movie about a one-man arsenal hell-bent on mopping the floor with grimy hoodlums who are turning the world into a cesspool of inhuman cruelty while wallowing in blood and gore. You've seen this movie before  an ordinary guy walks into a room full of gun-toting thugs and, in 40 seconds of jump cuts, dispatches everybody in the room and then struts out the door accompanied by a rock soundtrack.

Clichés like this can be avoided. I was impressed last week by the skill with which Scott Frank rethought the elements of this genre in A Walk Among the Tombstones, so it stands to reason that I had hope that Antoine Fuqua could have that kind of restraint with this movie. After all, this is his re-teaming with Denzel Washington after directing him to a Best Actor Oscar twelve years ago in Training Day. He can't. This is a routine bloodbath that steals elements from Taxi Driver, Walking Tall, Taken, Dirty Harry, and every other man-against-the-machine movie of the last 40 years.

The Equalizer is based very loosely on a CBS television series starring the late Edward Woodward that ran from 1985 to 1989. It was a good show, featuring the adventures of a retired intelligence agent-turned-private eye named Robert McCall who specialized in helping out the little guy. The movie has a little of that, it has Denzel Washington as a guy who lives a fastidious lifestyle, barren of all clutter, who spends his days and nights in a course of routine. He works in a home supply store by day and spends his evenings at his regular table at the corner coffee shop reading Hemingway.

We don't know much about him but his obsessive compulsive nature fascinates us  he notices things. He's interested in those around him. At work, he takes pity on a co-worker named Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who is trying to lose weight to become a security guard. At the restaurant, he has friendly conversations with a young girl named Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz) whose choice of outfits leave no mystery about what she does for a living.

One night Teri is picked up by her pimp and later ends up in the ICU. McCall follows up on her and finds out that the pimp is working for the Russian mob. What follows is the kind of movie that Charles Bronson use to make in his later years when he was just repeating the formula of Death Wish. McCall single-handedly sparks a one-man war against the Russian Mafia, not satisfied to take out the guy who roughed up Teri, he has to rub out the entire foundation of the city's criminal elite. Over and over he walks into a room and wipes out every guy in the room with whatever happens to be available at the moment, mainly power tools. No points for guessing that his job at the home supply store will come back in the film's action climax.

The movie is one long bore. It starts off with some interest before it gets tedious, then it gets frustrating, then it gets boring, then it gets repetitive, then it becomes a parody of itself. The villains all look the same. The story repeats the same stuff over and over. And Denzel's character is such a good fighter that there is no dramatic tension in the fight scenes. By the time we see Denzel walking in slow-mo toward the camera while the building behind him blows up real good, you get the feeling that the writer and the director just didn't care.

Denzel Washington in "The Toolbox Murders"

I'd been really looking forward to this film since I first saw the trailers around six months ago. An intellectually-untaxing revenge plot, a reboot of a classic 80s TV show from my childhood, and, to cap it all off, a fine actor in the lead part. However, it was something of a let-down in the end. Denzel Washington was fine, and Chloë Grace Moretz did well for such a young actress. But the script and the writing were simply horrible and gave them too few good scenes to work with, and some ridiculous choices to portray plausibly.

Without giving too much of the plot away, the final scene in particular turns into something of an unintentional farce. Denzel kills a guy with a *drill* at one point, FFS. What's the matter, McCall? You had two hours of setup plot to realise these that guys were experts and were coming at you tooled up, but you still decided to prepare for facing them like an unfortunate cross between MacGyver and Tim Taylor from Home Improvement? Oh, and, apparently former Spetznas soldiers have criminal tattoos all over their bodies. Just, you know, to badass them up a bit.

All-in-all, this is about the laziest and most cliché-ridden screen writing I've ever seen. I've seen worse, but not often. I generally like mindless vengeance movies like Taken and Die Hard. And I loved Edward Woodward's underplayed version of this same character. I don't recommend seeing this one if you usually enjoy that genre of film, or like me have fond memories of the 1980s TV series. Get the box set of the original and rent some Liam Neeson movies instead is my advice.

Fairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most sensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours, the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes, but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that said, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't want to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10

Huge disappointment. Enter the Cold war II!A single 60-years old guy destroys the most severe Russian gang in a local DIY with screws and hammers. The first 10 minutes were OK, but after that it turned into a cheap action without any logical plot. The final was crushing - Denzel goes to Moscow and kills the bad guy in his bathroom, preliminary liquidating his army of bodyguards. The message - Russians, don't mess with us or we shall send you our deadliest weapon - DIY supervisor. We have a new sheriff in town - killing the bad, protecting the poor Latin minority, punishing the corrupted cops... Hollywood best days were over long time ago. RIP! I haven't watched such ridiculous propaganda since Rambo. 2 hours wasted time and bad taste in the mouth.

In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. 

As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.

Wow...this was bad, just bad.

McCall has zero character development. I mean literally none. By the end of the film, we know nothing more about him than we do at the start. He's trying to read a hundred books, and obsessively keeps time of things (why?), and... The garbled explanation about his wife was so confusing that I have no idea what was said. I thought at least Nicolai would give an interesting story about McCall in the same way that McCall did about him, but no, we get nothing. So, how am I supposed to care about this robotic assassin? 

And the action violence...sigh. Hollywood just needs to stop. The scenarios are so ludicrous anymore as to be embarrassingly laughable. I mean, we see McCall in a room with four or five Russian gangsters, and we just *know* what's gonna happen. The scenes are either so predictable that they're boring beyond belief, or so far-fetched as to be unbelievable. How many times are we gonna see bad guys with guns feeling the need to get within two feet of the hero so that they are vulnerable to Hollywood kung fu? Or how about minions just bringing the protagonist right to the key leader? I just can't suspend my disbelief anymore. In the real world, assassinating a mafia don would be extremely difficult, requiring a lot of planning and luck. McCall just waltzes in and does it in an hour. That's not believable!

And the villains! You know, you need your villain to be credible and effective, or there's no urgency to the threat. Unfortunately, these Russians, despite how tough they look, are powderpuff buffoons! Seriously, McCall dispatches them so easily that they can't be taken seriously. The only one who actually threatens McCall in any way is the bald guy with the tweaked mustache - that was the only point in the whole film when it felt like McCall was in any danger. Other than that, the bad guys just fall for one obvious trick after another.

This truly was a paint-by-numbers, ludicrous, boring waste of time. What did it have to do with the original Equalizer anyway?

If it was not a Denzel Washington movie; it could easily pass for "B" direct to video movie. Low production values; not outstanding characters or actors (aside from Denzel and little used Cloe Moretz), a quite predictable and lazy written story, several "USA POLITICALLY CORRECT DETAILS" **spoiler follow** Denzel never kills a cop **end of spoiler** This is a movie Denzel can do it while sleeps and he is really good; but it is not a good movie by far. Too long for his own good and cheap special effects, uninteresting final showdown. Antoine Fuqua made the mid budget "Olympus Has Fallen" last year and the looked far more expensive that this one (which reportedly cost over 50M) In brief; if you are a fan of Denzel; get "Training Day"; this one is not worth the over two hours spent.

Yet again a movie about a lone (american) man that saves the day and kills all the (foreign) bad guys. OMG Hollywood this again. Who writes this crap. Seen it a million times before. Back in the day it was still cool but now just shameless.

Cliché after cliché, no humor, virtually no story, illogical, plot holes, action is somewhat enjoyable

To my shame i must admit i enjoyed some of the mindless action scenes but the biggest problem is that it is all to far fetched. Without any realistic basis it just looks stupid. Denzel isn't helping either. Don't get me wrong i like Denzel and credits to him for trying, but his (over) acting feels out of place. He is just trying to hard and way to serious in a movie you can't take serious.

I'm sorry to say but this movie is borderline pathetic. It tries to be a combination between Taken and 80s action movies and fails at both. Why?

For a single reason. I didn't sympathized with the main character, the hero. In movies like Taken, I could understand his motivations and drive because honestly, we would all do the same.

But in this movie, the motivation itself is a cliché. I liked the villain more than the hero, at least the villain was sophisticated.

Plus, this isn't Call of Duty. This guy can run, jump, fight, get shot three times and still be alright, fix his wounds with honey, defeat a team of special forces, kill a dozen people in the city and nobody saw anything or took his fingerprints and I could go on like this until tomorrow.

The plot defies logic (in the final act, it would have been simpler to simply bomb the entire complex where the hostages were and they would be done with it), the hero is made to look very smart and resourceful compared to everyone else and generally, the movie is a bore.

Look, Hollywood, this is 2014. Our Iqs increased a bit since 1990. Enough with the one man army plot. Enough with the "good guy kills 100 bad guys" type of story. It is not realistic. Even the Matrix was more realistic than this movie. A similar movie was The November Man but at least that was a bit more realistic. By the end of this movie, I despised the hero, felt like I've lost two hours of my time and wished I saw something else instead.

If you want to see something good, see Training Day instead. That is his BEST movie. Or watch Taken 1, 2 and 3. Or any other movie that isn't designed following the 1980 "Commando / Rambo" formula.

I like a good 'underdog triumphs over adversity' movie but we have been here before with Denzil (Man On Fire!) who I previously much respected for his earlier works. If you have seen any film in the genre you have already seen this which offers nothing original. Seems like Denzil had a spare couple of months and million (also producer credit) and thought his name could carry this predictable rehash of Edward Woodward's original, much more believable brand. As expected, DW is a great actor but he should be ashamed of this carbon copy as should those who voted to bring this to an IMDb 7. I am losing faith in this scoring. I know people liked this but I guess expectations are currently low.

I actually smelled the odor of a piece of "riiiiiight" cinema pretty early on, and decided to stop watching. A "riiiight" film, for those who don't know because I just made it up, is where the filmmaker tries to make you believe something so unrealistic and far fetched that you say to yourself (or maybe even say out loud): "riiiiiight, possibly followed by "suuuuuuuuuuure".

The boredom of a 10 hr flight got to me in the end, and I decided to turn it back on. Many "riiiiight"s later I got to the end. I often get people telling me that they like these movies even though they know they are far fetched because they are "just entertainment". But when everything is so overdone that it looks like a satire but it really isn't, I check out. This was such a film. In spite of maybe murdering 50 villains during the movie, Denzel is the good guy, and we are supposed to feel sympathy for him. And the Russian bad guys were so, so bad. Thank god Denzel is there to slaughter them all with no collateral damage. He's such a bad ass.

Don't get me wrong, i love Denzel Washington. I love every action flick he plays in 'cause he brought such charisma on the big screen. This one is an exception. I was ready to get pumped up by all the gore galore and crazy fight choreographs... and it's not what i am expecting, at all! 

The story is about a man named Bob McCall, a mysterious man i might add, who stumbles upon the world of Russian gangster. He met a girl named Teri, who is one of their prostitute, that one day got beaten. Bob got furious and goes for vengeance against them.

The movie got me all right, but i've never been so bored in my life. Let's start from the action. It didn't work. It supposed to give me any impact, yet i felt nothing. Blood are spurting everywhere, all right. But, why do they have to make it so bland?

The actors done all their things the script requires... nothing evoked emotions from me. I blame the screenwriters for giving no depth and not a single twist. Bad move!

Although, there are several things i'm going to highlight, like the camera-work. I loved Antoine Fuqua's style and it gives the movie more dignity than it was. And some scene involving Chlöe Grace Moretz with Denzel gave me a little bit interest for the dynamic they showed. 

I know Denzel Washington fans are going to love it, but just a fair warning; it's not really fun to watch even if the violence pushes your button. In the end, it's a bit of a dud.

This is such a bad movie on so many levels i do not understand the IMDb rating.

The violence is very graphic, and thats about it. Can not get more cliché than this movie, it's like Welcome to the Rileys with a whole bunch of retard thrown in.

The film is pretty much a definition of cliché, Ex special forces guy living an ordinary life, Corrupt cops that he beats up, ha ha, A young girl caught up with some nasty shite decides to trust this guy to save her, probably because of the way he stares at people.

It's just ridiculous, I walked out 2/3 through the movie, it really was that bad, only the second time in my life i've done that. And it's beyond me how the movie got such a high ranking here, the term ignorant masses comes to mind. 

If you love overdone overplayed clichés, you will love this film. Otherwise give it a miss.
