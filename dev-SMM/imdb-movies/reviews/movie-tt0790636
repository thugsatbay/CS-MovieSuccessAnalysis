### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as "A Crowd Pleaser," and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.

One of the best films I've seen this year! A raw, gritty, and incredible true story about a HIV diagnosed man who went to extraordinary lengths to survive at a time when the AIDS epidemic was at it's worst.

Matthew McConaughey who lost a significant amount of weight to play the role gives the performance of his career along with Jared Leto who's equally as good here. The two give quite possibly the best performances I've seen in a film all year in which I actually forgot I was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if I was watching real people. There's no doubt they will both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

While this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall, it's excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it. While it's defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch, it's a truly inspiring (and important) true story and one of the years best films.

McConaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films. His recent performances however, have shown that the man truly is one of the best actors working in the business right now. Dallas Buyers Club is only further proof of this.

Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning performances.

Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds for their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way loving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon, the sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a kind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once, but is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those infected with HIV virus in the 1980's. The numbers impacted exploded and the medical profession was ill-equipped to properly treat the patients.

This is based on a true story and a real life guy (Woodroof) who became a most unlikely beacon of hope for AIDS patients. Woodroof fought the medical industry, Pharmaceutical companies and the government (FDA, DEA, IRS). It's impossible to miss the message and accusations that most of these had a single goal of increasing profits, rather than curing the disease. And that's where the story lags a bit. Michael O'Neill and Dennis O'Hare are the faces of greed and bureaucracy, while Jennifer Garner, Leto, and Griffin Dunne represent the side with a heart. Woodroof seems to be a guy who just doesn't want to die, sees a business opportunity, and even learns a little bit about humanity along the way.

There have been numerous other projects that deal with AIDS, including: Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and the recent documentary How to Survive a Plague. This may be the first with a protagonist who is simply unlikeable, despite his passion and strong survival instincts. McConaughey doesn't shy away from the homophobic personality and cruel manner of speech that Woodroof possesses. We never doubt his frustration at those controlling the big picture, but we never really see him connect with those his brash tactics help.

McConaughey is on a dream run as an actor right now, and it certainly wouldn't be surprising to see him garner an Oscar nomination. But it would be a mistake to chalk that up to his losing so much weight - he really delivers a character that we won't soon forget. And let's not overlook Mr. Leto, who has been away from acting for 4 years touring with his band. He is a remarkable talent and a true screen presence. Compare this role to his Mark David Chapman in Chapter 27. It's not just the range of weight, but moreso the range in acting that so impresses.

Also worth noting here is the outstanding cinematography of Yves Belanger. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of the moments, while not losing the big picture. Director Jean-Marc Vallee (The Young Victoria) and co-writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack work together for a solid foundation, but it's McConaughey and Leto that we will most remember ... and of course, the pics of the great Marc Bolan on the wall. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com

Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010,  Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked  well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of  romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996,  McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To  Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like,  critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise. 
In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer,  a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some  of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in  what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent  memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be  casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills. 
While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time  span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of  McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and  proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like  himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction  Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in  heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient  Ron Woodruff. 
For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally  well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron  Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money  throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling,  chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and  his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't  until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized,  giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives  of many others. 
Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty  day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his  hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested  medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of  AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United  States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a  close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the  ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced  doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral  treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic  money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the  realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working.  Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the  two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for  paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the  FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks  to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic,  homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his  opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual  discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s. 
Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors  physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic  forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty  amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon.  Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and  grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The  Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical  spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a  candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal  struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the  United States in the 1980′s. 
Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and  edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for  wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic.  Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to  be a part of. 
Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at  this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their  is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon.  His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a  large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's  dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will  surely be rewarded. 
Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting  effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of  the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park  living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not  AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government  fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful  companies is wealth, or health. 
Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic  based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate  condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires  others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the  powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled  in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto  ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized,  passionate display of what it's like to die "with your boots on";  dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.

At times Mr. McConaughey's acting abilities may have been in question, but doubtless there has always been a genius just waiting to explode. And explode it does in Dallas Buyers Club. Given a fully explored and developed character, he is the centrifugal force of the engaging plot of an American tragedy, seamless direction, lively dialogue and creme de la creme supporting actors. This actor, who proves he can blur the lines between acting and real, rises to the ranks of Dustin Hoffman, Sean Penn, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, our Grand Pere, Jack Nicholson, and his own idol, Paul Newman. Unquestionably, he deserves a spot in Academy Awards for Best Actor. At long last, given the opportunity, he has proved to possess truly exquisite talent; to be an actor's actor, worthy of study, deep respect, even awe. He skillfully brings to life an oddball cowboy character to the level of hero, and mesmerizes the audience at every single breath, by every stretch of his emaciated gorgeous heart, soul and body. Shirts off to Matthew McConaughey, and may you never doubt his abilities again.

After watching this film, I've run out of glowing superlatives to describe it. First of all, a word on Matthew McConaughey. I've always thought of him as a relative lightweight in the film world, the sexy leading man best designed for selling tickets and little else. I am happy to report that I was mistaken. Sadly, horribly mistaken. From the very first frame of this amazing movie, I was so amazed at his physical transformation that it took a half an hour just to adjust my eyes to the frail creature I saw before me. But it was real, just as his stellar performance both illuminated the way I look at the entire AIDS epidemic and the toll it takes on humanity, both gay and straight. This film happily avoided all previous clichés and typical treatments of the subject matter, transcending every other film I have seen regarding HIV/AIDS. For so long I have decried the serious lack of great film for ADULTS, with seemingly everything out today designed for pre-pubescent teenaged boys interesting in nothing more than mindless video games and moronic super hero sequels. As with many memorable independent films, this gem was elevated to heroic status with the incredible acting of McConaughey, in concert with the amazing Jaret Leto, providing the perfect foil to his perfect, character-driven role. Every, single reason for going to the movies is present in the glorious truth and humanity of this landmark effort, a "must-see' for anyone seeking superior acting in profusion. If there's a God in heaven, Matthew and Jaret should both win the Academy Awards for Best Performance by a Leading Man, and Best Supporting Actor. Each actor went far beyond mere "acting" in this film, becoming so entirely immersed into character that they stopped acting and just BECAME. Don't miss this important and moving film.

This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie. It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That is, it adds to the story.

After being diagnosed with HIV, electrician Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) learns he only has 30 days left to live. After getting an illegal supply of AZT, Ron finds that this isn't doing anything to help him. Eventually fleeing to Mexico, Ron learns of and begins to take a particular drug that hasn't been approved in the U.S. When he finds that this drug is improving his health, Ron sees an opportunity. After smuggling the drugs across the border, Ron, and another HIV patient named Rayon (Jared Leto) begins selling the drug to other citizens with the virus. During the process, Ron battles the medical field and the law in order to prove how beneficial his buyer's club is.

Based on the true story of the real Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club follow one man's actions on his mission to survive and how he started a revolution in a time when HIV/AIDS was a major issue. The story itself, not only is interesting, but it doesn't contain a dull moments. It filled with dramatic elements with dashes of comedic moments. It also features characters that we come to find ourselves close to. Every one of which gets their own time to shine. The film does jump around quite a bit, but it does so for the sake of the story and the events that are to come, and through every major point in Woodroof's life and battle with HIV.

Among the cast is Matthew McConaughey who easily gives the performance of his career as the blunt and clever Ron Woodroof. McCoaughey conveys different aspects of Woodroof with such ease. There are moments where he portrays Woodroof as being tough as nails, but then he can instantly shift gears into his emotional side. The comic relief aspects also come off completely natural. Jennifer Garner stars as Woodroof's female doctor friend Eve Saks. Garner does a fine job of giving off her charm as she always does, but with this performance we see the conflict her character is battling between her career and doing what is right. But the one actor who stands out the most is Jared Leto as the cross-dressing Rayon. Leto provides not only a lot of the major comic relief, but he also brings the heart of the story. We are shown Rayon as this carefree, happy-go-lucky character, but eventually we are shown just deeply affected this disease brings him emotionally, and Leto brings all of this to the table flawlessly.

Dallas Buyers Club is completely deserving of all of its Oscar buzz. From its powerful story, to its outstanding performances by the two leading males. Whether or not it is or isn't nominated for the 2014 Oscars, it is a film that has to be seen.

My Rating: 8/10

At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, patients were advised to wait. In the six years following the first recording of the AIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while waiting. In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then Vice President George H.W. Bush has been quoted as saying "If you want change, change your behavior." Roger Ebert recalls, "Politicians did not want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted admitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care workers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes refused to accept the corpses." 

As described in David France's documentary How to Survive a Plague, activists such as the New York-based organization ACT UP began to protest against the government's callous indifference, challenging the FDA to change their drug approval procedure and the pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices and speed up their research process. In addition to the organized group protests, individuals also did their part and the determination of one unlikely crusader, electrician Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a homophobic "good ol' Texas party boy," is the centerpiece of Jean Marc-Vallée's gritty and hard-hitting Dallas Buyers Club.

Written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and based on real events, it is the story of Woodroof's personal struggles after being diagnosed with AIDS and his efforts to spread public awareness of the disease and help reduce the suffering and extend the lives of AIDS patients. As the film opens, the heterosexual, drug-using and unabashedly promiscuous Woodroof receives the bad news from his doctors that he only has thirty days to live. Reacting with vitriol, he storms out of the hospital, cursing and making homophobic slurs while accusing the staff of making the wrong diagnosis.

After thoroughly researching the disease, however, and accepting the idea of his serious illness, Woodroof hears of a clinical trial for the new drug AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United States. His attempt, however, to become one of the participants is denied and he has to purchase the drug surreptitiously from an orderly. Unfortunately, he soon finds out that the dosage of AZT he is taking is toxic and his condition worsens. Refusing to give up, he visits an unlicensed American doctor (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico who has had some success with alternative treatments such as vitamins and protein-based anti-viral drugs.

Smuggling non-FDA approved experimental and alternative medicines into the U.S., he creates a business that allows him to distribute the drugs free of charge to AIDS patients who pay a monthly membership fee to join his Dallas Buyers Club, one of many such clubs that sprang up around the country. Woodroof is assisted in his venture by the drug-addicted transsexual Rayon (Jared Leto), a fellow patient that he met during his hospitalization. Though the film's depiction of Rayon does little to break the gay stereotype, their mutual engagement in helping AIDS victims helps Ron see his business partner in a different light than on their first meeting.

With the help of a sympathetic doctor, Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), Rayon and Woodroof work together while dodging Food and Drug Administration enforcers and the wrath of the pharmaceutical companies. In one of his best efforts, Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40 pounds for the movie, delivers a brilliant performance as the emotionally volatile but basically decent Woodroof. Though ultimately, not all alternative drugs proved to be useful, Woodroof and Rayon's determination in the face of powerful interests helped paved the way for development of new treatments, even though it took until the late 90s to come up with one that was fully effective. As a result of their efforts and that of countless others, HIV is no longer the death sentence it once was.

Other reviewers have ably reviewed this film, so I'll just say that this small gem is the best film I've seen so far this year. Both lead actors give sparkling performances, and in scenes where they share the screen, you might need sunglasses to handle the sun-bright intensity.

Of note is that this entire film was shot in only 23 days and Leto, in particular, said in an interview on the Daily Show, that he didn't have much time to rehearse, making the performance even more impressive. The only detraction was Jennifer Garner. She barely projects the authority of a nurse, let alone a doctor, even though female doctors in the 70's (and maybe today) were second-class citizens.

In 1985, in Dallas, the homophobic electrician and rodeo rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a smoker and cocaine and alcohol user that frequently has sex with hookers and promiscuous women. When he faints in his trailer, he is sent to the hospital where Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) and Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) tell him that he is HIV+ and will die within thirty days. Ron also meets the travesty Rayon (Jared Leto) that is drug addicted that also has the disease. 

Ron does not accept the diagnosis since he is not homosexual but a couple of days later he realizes that the diagnosis may be accurate. He researches about the disease and learns that AZT might be lethal for infected people. Further, he discovers that in Mexico there is a doctor with revoked license named Vass (Griffin Dunne) that uses alternative drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Ron improves his healthy and decides to sell the drugs in Dallas. He makes a partnership with Rayon and soon he creates the Dallas Buyers Club, where the memberships pay four hundred dollars per month to have the necessary drugs. But the FDA does not accept his research and he is oppressed by the authorities. 

"Dallas Buyers Club" is a great movie based on the true story of a terminal man infected by HIV+ that fights against the system to prolong his and his clients' lives using drugs not accepted by the FDA. Matthew McConaughey deserves his Oscar and it is impossible to recognize Jared Leto, also awarded with an Oscar. The story also denounces the participation of the pharmaceutical industry and doctors in the United States of America using unethical procedures to test and sell their drugs. My vote is eight.

In the interest of balance (and as a clue to the filmmaker's intentions), it's worth noting that many friends and associates of the real life Ron Woodruff have attested that he was not remotely homophobic and worked happily alongside gays. Some even thought he was gay, or at least bi. (Interviews with these people can easily be found online). In choosing to depict Woodruff as a redneck homophobe Dallas Buyers Club rather self-consciously opts for an unquestionably straight hero, while almost entirely airbrushing gays out of the picture. It also defames a real life hero who has nobody left to defend him. The truth, of course, is that the Dallas Buyers Club, like many similar ventures at the time, was largely run by gay activists. But they are nowhere to be seen here. Instead, we have the titillating composite figure of Rayon, the transvestite with a heart of (Oscar) gold. Again, interesting that the filmmakers opted to replace all those real life gays with a star turn for an actor in a dress. 

Many reviewers have been happy to describe this movie as sensitive or daring or brave. In fact, it's just another piece of Hollywood exploitation, as timid and untruthful in its way as Philadelphia, and far more concerned with being a showcase for actors than with the truth of the story it purports to be championing.

Before it seems that my "review" seems one-sided and completely negative, I want to emphasize it shouldn't take away from the performances from the two lead actors. I think they have done an excellent job overall.

My major criticism centers around the continuing inaccuracies of Hollywood and very simplistic portrayals of the complicated themes and issues affecting the players during the 1980s and 1990s during the US AIDS epidemic.

I understand the target audience is not going to need to know accurate history, certainly not in America, and also appreciate this is strictly intended for entertainment. I just find it ironic that political extremes always denounce propaganda while continuing to use it for their own means. I found the script very poorly done and wholly inaccurate with such severe bias after researching the real Ron Woodroof.

Conflicting information 1. Ron likely wasn't as extremely homophobic as portrayed. He was never as confrontational as depicted in the movie. He was also never in the rodeo. 2. All the treatments he was marketing were wholly ineffective in treating HIV/AIDS. Read for yourself on DDC (Zalcitabine) and others were downright harmful. In fact due to the lack of follow-up of the patients, many may have had an accelerated demise due to some of the combinations used (impossible to say of course). 3. The FDA had already loosened some of the restrictions on drug trials to fast track treatments. There were never any dramatic seizures like in the film. 4. Dr. Saks, who was horribly portrayed by Jennifer Garner and Rayon are fictional for dramatic elements only.

I could continue on. My issue is that proponents always say how great it is of Hollywood to raise awareness on a film. I appreciate this but it distorts history and harms how people react to ongoing crisis if this should arise again. It is like trying to pass on an action movie as based on a reality when we know it should be purely for entertainment.

DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Kevin Rankin, Griffin Dunne, Michael O'Neill. McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance of complex strength and a certain shabby nobility as Ron Woodruff, a rough-and-tumble Texas good ol' boy whose sudden diagnosis of contracting HIV and given a death sentence instead galvanizes the pig-headed, homophobic rodeo cowboy a chance at redemption by sticking to his guns, digging in his heels and serving up an ad-hoc business selling memberships to those similarly afflicted for non-FDA approved drugs. While Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay serves the subject all- too familiarly from one-note borderline redneck to patron saint somewhere in between it is the clear eyes direction by Jean-Marc Vallee and his star's amazing acting skills in making an unlikable reprobate something we all recognize: all too human in an unjust world. Leto is equally remarkable as a transvestite homosexual who become Woodroof's aide-de-camp and best friend in the process while Garner's green doctor balances out as a medical professional learning the knotty ropes of big pharma tactics. McConaughey lost a reported nearly 40 pounds to give his skeletal appearance the verisimilitude necessary but make no mistake he delivers the goods, warts an all with a sense of dark humor and self-worth.

Dallas Buyers Club is a compelling and stunning watch. The films main plot has to with the world of AIDS and HIV in the 80s. Ron Woodroff gets infected with HIV, and is told he has 30 days to live, he then takes things into his own hands and goes to Mexico. In Mexico he gets introduced to new drugs that help with HIV and AIDS but they are not FDA approved. Here starts the battle of Woodroff VS the FDA. He starts his own club where he treats people with AIDS and HIV, thats the main plot. Acting wise Matthew Mconganuey gives his career best performance, he lost almost 100 pounds for his role, and he stuns with such a mature and spellbinding performance. But Jared Leto steals the show, he touches new heights with DBC, his performance is award worthy. The films minuses are the slow pace and excessive length.Overall this film is path breaking because the subject of AIDS has not been talked about much in films, its a must watch for all cinema lovers.

I generally think McConoughey had become a bit too self absorbed. This movie, however, does validate my belief that he wants to do valid, absorbing film, whether comedic or serious. The storyline is - without spoiler - simply the early days of AIDS. The fears, the rumors, the medical community's stalwart continuation of using the victims as test subjects without real concern or commitment to resolution in many cases. Based on a true story, I recommend you watch the film for the period boldness, the two primary characters' acting, the sad part or directing which put a talented actress in a bad light. The person on whom the story is based is but one of us and we all have a story to tell. It's magnificent that someone read the Desiderata and determined to tell his story, which is worthy of your open minded, compassionate viewing. His daughter found it to be very real and her story about her father is worth looking up after you watch.

This film came to the UK with the usual awards hype that seems to accompany any number of bigger films that are released around this time, but I had made an effort to avoid it and didn't know too much about it other than McConaughey being talked up about his performance. Indeed I had ignored it as much as I could and to the point where I really knew the barebones of the plot  which was to say it was a true story of a guy who got HIV and, frustrated by the lack of medical treatment at the time, decided to start running effective drugs unapproved by the FDA across the Mexican border into the US. With this very basic grasp I did worry that the film would be sentimental, making a hero of the main character, playing up the plight of the infected and generally being the sort of film they wheel out for awards at this time of year, ticking all the topics off that gets voters onboard.

Happily the truth is that, although there is an element of this, the film doesn't overplay to this side of its nature and instead delivers a remarkable straight telling without too much excess. The character of Ron is a hustler first and everything else second and this doesn't change once he finally gets through the "bargaining, anger, denial, acceptance" stages of his diagnosis. As a result his efforts to bring in the drugs are not done out of some selfless act of wanting to help others as he prepares to meet his maker, but rather as part of his own fight for life he hits on a scheme to make money  and for the majority of the film this is the case. This central truth to the character really works to rob the film of sentimentality of him and therefore of the wider situation and it makes for a better film because we are engaged because we are interested rather than becomes a sweeping musical score or "Oscar clip" moment tells us to feel something. It does still do this and it does still bring out the sense of people struggling to live while the structure supposed to help them does little about it, but it does so in a way that is refreshingly free of smaltz.

Although this is a strength, it should also be said that the film doesn't manage to bring it all together as well as it should given the subject matter. It just feels like it falls a few steps short of greatness in terms really delivering an emotional punch that informs on the individual and the bigger picture at the same time  it does do this, but it is more consistent rather than building to this. Despite this it still works and although it lacks these real highs of delivery, it was functional and successful and I appreciated the lack of easy sentiment. The performances match this and in particular McConaughey gets the tone of the film and by return sets it. He is great, not because of the weight loss but because he delivers an unsympathetic character and convinces as him whether he is raging in denial, hustling or hurting. He is the heart of the film and it works as well as it works thanks a lot to him. The support characters are never more than supporting though, but of course Leto is strong in his role  not because he cross-dresses, but because he is the character and he makes Rayon about much more than the appearance. Zahn, Garner, O'Neill, Dunne and other recognizable faces all do solid work but primarily this is McConaughey's film.

Dallas Buyers Club may not be perfect but it is consistent and it is engaging. I appreciate that it never resorts to easy smaltz or cheap sentimentality and it seems perfectly fine with its flawed character being flawed throughout the film. It is a well told story which links well from the individual's story into the bigger picture, even if it doesn't quite impact at that level as it could have done. Within the solid and effective frame of this story, McConaughey then seals the deal with a really strong lead performance as he takes yet another massive leap away from being that guy leaning against the title on the bus poster.

I have felt this before, this feel of being taken aback seated speechless for a moment after witnessing something epic. It took me a while but then it dawned upon me that this is what I felt when I first watched Daniel Day-Lewis portray the Academy Award Winning role in LINCOLN. Undoubtedly in the most outstanding performances of their careers Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are my favorites thus far for bringing home the goods at the Oscars for the nominations of Best Performance of an Actor in a Leading role and supporting roles respectively in the bio-drama DALLAS BUYERS CLUB.

If you had suddenly being told that you have only 30 days to live and that you have to make peace with this information how would you react? Rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) wakes up in hospital to this news which is shared with him by his attending physician. Woodroof who has been diagnosed positive of the HIV virus reacts to this revelation in anger. In fact it is this anger that fuels him to the distances that he reaches out for survival. Woodroof who was initially treated with the drug stated AZT did not respond positively to them. Instead the needle happy bull rider tried experimenting with medications and drugs to concoct his own special brew of HIV anti bodies, Strangely these events did lead him to certain discoveries that attracted the attention of the legal system whose waking wish was to shut him down. May it be money, may it be his human instinct to live, Woodroof along with Rayon (Jared Leto) did not give up which invariably resulted in the opening of the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB ; a business that dealt the FDA unapproved medication to HIV patients.

Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee has difficulty in controlling the rhythm of the screenplay and is wobbly at first. Trailer trash sex scenes and orgies and drugs engross the first hour of the movie which although has relevance to what Woodroof is all about did not contribute much to what the movie is entirely discussing about. Once Jean gets his feet firmly on the ground for a good 45 minutes with the actual matter the screenplay derails yet again when the battle between life and death becomes a political tussle in between Woodroof and the government. For starters the entire political involvement is abruptly handled with I would say less than 5 minutes of screen time and top of that to the audience it breaks rhythm and direction of the true struggle of Woodroof and Rayon. 

What keep this loosely driven motion picture in balance are its two lead performers. The weight losses alone show the commitment and the help of makeup and hairstyling simple accentuates the entire performance even further. It's been sometime since a movie of this caliber has been in our midst. There is no room for excessive CGI. No room for artificial imagery and what we see is pretty much what goes on in front of the lens.

Verdict

Exquisite work on the part of the leading men. McConaughey and Leto are on a whole new level. It's a slow paced bio-pic so don't expect intensity instead expect detailing and finesse. A movie only for the lovers of the genre. I repeat only for the lovers of the genre.

Homophobic, drug-addicted, alcoholic, womanizer, cowboy, diagnosed with AIDS, can all describe Ron Woodruff, the subject of Jean-Marc Vallee's new bio-pic Dallas Buyers Club. Matthew McConaugnhey plays Woodruff and has one of "Hollywoods" scariest body transformation every caught on film.

It's 1985 Dallas, Texas in the heart of local rodeo country. Upon being electrocuted on the job, Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) awakens in the hospital to the news of him having contracted the HIV disease. After hearing of his thirty day life expectancy, Ron begins to find ways to procure the AZT drug, but when once his supply is up, Woodruff ventures to Mexico, where a non-licensed physician prescribes him non FDA approved drugs. With these drugs, Ron starts up the Dallas Buyers Club, where there is no fee for the medicine but there's a four hundred dollar monthly fee. 

Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of his career, next to his role in Jeff Nichols, Mud. McConaughey's transformation is hauntingly exquisite. The stages of weight-less is dominant in the film, from the opening scene of a sickly looking Woodruff having intercourse with two women in a rodeo bull pin, to his disturbingly thin, turkey neck after seven years with the disease. McConaughey will most certainly receive an Oscar nomination. There would be no Dallas Buyers Club without Rayon played by Jared Leto. Leto gives his best performance and with no doubt will be nominated for supporting actor. I was wholly absorbed in Leto's role. His transformation as a transgender male, battling the disease is frighting, note-worthy, and aggressively captivating. Jennifer Garner is also quite good in her role as Ron's Doctor. Steve Zahn, and Dennis O'Hare also provide fantastic minimal, supporting roles. 

Jean Marc Vallee directs such a fine, touching film about a man with so much hate in his heart who grows, through his disease to learn to have an open heart and mind, which allows him to have true friendships with the unlikeliest of people. Such a remarkable film with so much heart, intuition, and bravery that should be enjoyed by everyone. 

The film comes extremely heavy-handed in its subject matter, there will be the few who will hate the films pacing, but Dallas Buyers Club is one of the best films of the year. I give Dallas Buyers Club an "A+"

'DALLAS BUYERS CLUB': Five Stars (Out of Five)

Another likely Oscar contender is this biographical drama film starring Matthew McConaughey as an electrician/rodeo bull rider, named Ron Woodroof, who contracted AIDS (in Dallas in 1985) and started a business supplying many other victims of the deadly disease with the (unapproved) medication they needed. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn and Denis O'Hare and was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. It was written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack and is based on a 1992 article, published in 'The Dallas Morning News', by Bill Minutaglio. McConaughey and Leto are almost guaranteed to get Oscar nominations (for 'best lead' and 'supporting' actor) and they deserve to. The film is a bit more of a long shot for 'best picture' but it's possible and would deserve that prestigious recognition as well. 

The film begins in Dallas in 1985 when Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is told by doctors, while seeing them about a work injury, that he is HIV+ and only has 30 days left to live. Ron originally doesn't believe them because he, like many at the time, believed only homosexuals contracted the HIV virus. He's also extremely homophobic and outraged at the diagnosis (which he sees as an insult). After he learns more about HIV (and AIDS) he begins taking AZT (which he obtains illegally) but it only worsens his condition. He then travels to Mexico and meets Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne) who gives him the information and alternative medication (which is unapproved in the US) he needs to prolong his life and stay somewhat healthy. Woodroof then starts a business in the US supplying the medicine and vitamins to others, with the help of another AIDS patient he meets in the hospital (Leto). The FDA goes to war with him over this. 

I really enjoyed the film because it's about rebellion and fighting the system and powers that be. In this case the system is the big business of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies, who are always purposefully keeping helpful medication from people in need in order to improve their profits. I also like movies with unlikeable characters that grow and learn throughout their journeys and become better people that not only end up helping themselves but many others as well. That's what Woodroof did; he started out only interested in money but ended up really wanting to help others. McConaughey is great in the film (in one of his best performances) and so is Leto. Garner is surprisingly good as well. The writing and directing is topnotch and it's just a very moving and inspiring film. One of the year's best for sure!

. . . contending with an almost overwhelming horde of Big Pharma, Big Medicine, and FDA devils. Not only is DALLAS BUYERS CLUB the best movie yet to come out in 2013 (and I've seen about 97% of theatrical releases earning at least $500,000 domestically), but it rivals Tom Hanks' PHILADELPHIA and TV's ANGELS IN AMER!CA for the top spot among all the AIDS features ever made. In Matthew McConaughey's best performance to date, he transforms his body FOR A REASON (as Robert De Niro did in RAGING BULL, not as a stunt A La Christian Bale for THE MACHINIST). This is not some boring and\or forgettable disease-of-the week movie (such as LORENZO'S OIL--how often do they run that on any of the premium movie channels?). It has a great cast, with Jennifer Garner easily topping her role from PEARL HARBOR in DBC's two good doctors\one bad doc set-up, as she eventually joins McConaughey's Ron on the journey from hateful ignorance to transcending love. Jared Leto's Raymond\Rayon pulls hardest at the heartstrings, but Denis O'Hare as Big Pharmaceutil's mercenary pawn Dr. Sevard not only wins kudos as the most hateful villain of 2013, but gives Nurse Rachett from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST a run for her money as the worst medical monster of all time (sorry, HUMAN CENTIPEDE guy, I'm talking serious flicks here, not shock horror). Finally, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB exposes the American F.D.A. (Food & Drug Administration) for the lost cause that it is--a cause that would actually be WORTH shutting the government down to reform!

Mathew Mc. obviously deserves a bit of a salute. His efforts to slim way down brings to mind, obviously, Christian Bale. Not bad company to be in!

But the REAL STAR is Jared Leto. I know his other work and kept reminding myself that he/she was really a transvestite. And so sad to see the drug use (shh). And he/she was truly pretty. Of course, in real life, he's s a gorgeous guy. So,I hope the Academy will take note!

Also interesting to hear of the Interferon drugs talked about. Now THAT'S something I know about. I have M.S. and inject myself once a week with it. It slows the progression of the disease Too bad the movie doesn't mention the other druga now available. Perhaps they weren't around then.

I'm not a doctor, just more familiar with some of the drugs - would be great if I weren't!

After "12 Years a Slave" and "The Wolf of Wall Street" I'd thought I'd seen all of the serious best actor candidates for this year. That was before I'd seen Matthew McConaughey's performance in "Dallas Buyers Club". The performance is simply outstanding: less showy that DiCapprio's in "Wolf"; certainly less worthy than Ejiofor's in "Slave"; but in my book, this would get my vote if I were an Oscar or BAFTA voter. He is nominated which is good: but he won't win I fear.

It is almost impossible to like McConaughey's character - Ron Woodroof - in this film. He is a racist, a bigot, a homophobe, a misogynist, a drug and alcohol abuser and has streaks of violence simmering just under his hateful and hating Texan skin. If there was anyone you would cross the road to avoid, it would be him. And yet McConaughey fills the role with such power and such passion he makes the story utterly gripping. Seldom have 2 hours flown by quicker in the cinema. There have been three physical transformations this year that have made you think "that can't be good for him": the first was Christian Bale's pot belly in "American Hustle". And then there's McConnaughey and co-star Jared Leto in this film. Clearly both have been on an extreme diet for a considerable period: less five:two and more seven:zero. Painful to watch: why do actors do this to themselves? The film, based on a true story, tells the story of Woodroof's fight to stay alive against the ravages of Aids in the mid-80s: he refuses to lay down and die, as all the doctor's predict, and goes on a one man crusade to identify and bring into the country - against the US Food and Drug Administration's approval - experimental drug combinations that will prolong his life. During this journey, of course, he comes into close contact with the gay community that in his previous life he so despised: and the mirror of his own past views is held up to him during his dramatic role-reversal through the reaction of his former 'friends' and colleagues to both himself and his new-found gay friends. This sets up a devastatingly powerful and emotional story.

Also of note are McConaughey's two supporting actors: Jennifer Garner as his doctor friend Eve and (particularly) Jared Leto as his transsexual friend Rayon: receiving a well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.

A word of caution for those easily offended: Dallas Buyer's Club features extensive sex and drug taking scenes, and whilst not as extreme as "Wolf of Wall Street", this is also perhaps another one not to take your maiden aunt or squirming teenage son/daughter to see. But for everyone else, this is a highly recommended film. Delightfully un-sugar-coated, thoughtful and gripping, and a triumph for the leads, the writers (Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) and Canadian-born director Jean-Marc Vallée ("The Young Victoria").

Matthew McConaughey is barely recognizable as Ron Woodroof, an electrician/womanizer who ends up finding out he's contracted HIV/AIDS and has 30 days left to live. After searching deeper for information on a relatively unknown disease (at the time), he finds out that there is existing medication that is not yet approved in the U.S.A. that could help him survive longer.

However, after running into red tape when trying to obtain medication, he decides to smuggle massive amounts of pharmaceutical products and starts selling them to other HIV/AIDS infected patients, creating the "Dallas Buyers Club".

First of all, what a film. Jean-Marc Vallée's "C.R.A.Z.Y." was quite something to watch, but "Dallas Buyers Club" is a tremendous achievement. Vallée's directing is stellar, the script is top notch, and features a palette of characters that makes this story truly engaging and human.

Homophobia, illness, lust, being incapable of receiving proper treatment, smuggling, death, friendship, the limitations of the legal system, these are all themes that would lead one to think that this film is a depressing drama. It is not. And that's where the success of "Dallas Buyers Club" lies. All these themes would make the perfect recipe for a melodrama, wrap it up in a small package with a big star (McConaughey), and put the "Based on a true Story" stamp. But it's so much, much more.

"Dallas Buyers Club" avoids all the traps of melodrama by being whole-heartedly hilarious at times, with just the proper dose of raw emotion, and performances that will be remembered for ages. Half-way through the film, my friends and I looked at each other, in a bit of disbelief, unanimously agreeing that McConaughey deserves an Oscar for this. Jared Leto is also wonderful as Rayon, an AIDS-infected transvestite patient that will become a great friend and business partner, and that will trigger Woodroof's change of vision towards homosexuality. And it is not drastic. It comes in all kinds of subtleties and heart-warming moments. Hats off to Jennifer Garner as well, she is flawless.

Without ever offering a heavy-hearted tone, this is a story of perseverance and positivity with an interesting setting that sheds some light on an often forgotten page of history. Engaging social drama, well-written comedy, and wonderful cinematic experience altogether.

Great movie. Moving in its take on homophobia, intolerance and ignorance and damning in its take on government regulation, rigidity, corruption and stupidity. The big drug companies don't come out of this unscathed either.

The most powerful and moving aspect, however, is the transformation of an everyman into a champion for the greater good. (Admittedly, however, his motives were also commercially driven). While some people might have let their circumstances overwhelm them, he fought back.

Superb performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. McConoughey's role was the bigger one but Leto's was tougher (and, to a certain extent, possibly more fun!). Both of them had to make significant changes to their physical appearance for their role.

If ever somebody doubted McConaughey's abilities as an actor, this will put them to rest. Certainly, his 90s-to-mid-2000s roles relied mostly on his physical appearance and were more style than substance (A Time to Kill was the exception) but with his last few roles (this and True Detective especially) he has shown himself to be an actor of substance. 

Supporting cast are OK, but not great. Jennifer Garner is the weak link in the cast. Not terrible, but she just doesn't seem to have the right presence or believability. Hillary Swank would have been a lot better for the role (and was originally cast, apparently, but had to pull out due to a scheduling conflict).

The only negative is that certain details, important to the plot, seem glossed over. I sometimes felt like a major moment had too little lead- up or background. More detail, even if it made the movie 30 minutes longer, would have been welcome.
