### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
It's pretty easy to review this one. If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat. It holds up to the expectations and plays cleverly with 'being aware' of making basically the same movie again. The good thing about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some surprises and good action. I basically laughed from the first minute up to the (awesome!) end credits! If you like that type of comedy, this one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the funniest flick this year so far! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and you can see and feel, how they enjoyed doing this movie. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or professors for that matter). Everyone who's been to college can relate to those stereotypes (e.g. the pseudo intellectuals, the sport jocks, the art students etc.) and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ("The Lego Movie") do a great job spoofing those clichés while at same time debunk the downsides and shallowness of those groups or college life in general. 

Verdict: Go see it, if you liked the first one. I can't say if it's better, but it certainly holds up. And I liked the first one pretty much. So there you go...

My initial expectations were that '22 Jump Street' would be an over-the- top and cheesy sequel created solely to make money... I was wrong. '22 Jump Street' truly builds on the basis of the first film, further expanding upon the bromantic chemistry between Tatum and Hill creating an even more solid sequel full of good-natured humour and relentless action that made its predecessor such a great film. With Ice Cube having more of an impact this time round, the trio pursue their leads to ensure the villains are brought to justice. The direction duo have pulled off another amazing film to add to their filmography, a truly impressive and hilariously funny film.

How on Earth is this film rated so highly? There's no true wit or intelligence within the script, it's just stupid, lame jokes & a lot of unnecessary swearing which the movie seems to think is funny. I'm not saying swearing doesn't have a place in film, but overusing them to this extent is extremely noticeable & came across as childish.

The story is about as boring and formulaic as they come. First act; they enter college, second act; their relationship is tested, third act; everything works out, happy ending. It's like they didn't even try to be different or original.

Every single character is a one-dimensional stereotype. They never exhibit traits that show any form of depth; they were all so formulaic it felt like all their actions were generated from a computer.

Overall, absolute piece of garbage. If you're American and enjoy flat-out idiotic humor devoid of any wit or intelligence, I recommend it, but otherwise stay away.

I have never seen such a bad movie like this one. The script is a huge load of illogical and absurd events which in the end collapse together into am anti-climax ending. And the acting even manages to out-worsen the completely trashy plot. Every actors and actresses in this film seem to worry that the audiences might not be able to hear them clearly so they just yelled at a maximum volume and it was not pleasant at all! The the slap-tick humor could have been able to save this film from becoming a total disaster but frankly it didn't work at all.

Trust me, there's literally nothing good about this cheap piece of B-rated half-ass movie. Save your money and never give it a go!

Loaded with potential, 22 JUMP STREET is the sequel to the comedic buddy teamup (based on the 1980's Johnny Depp TV show) where Christopher Tatum and Jonah Hill posed as high schoolers to bust a drug dealer Not only did it score at the box office, 21 JUMP STREET was actually really funny and involving, and the duo made a fantastic polar opposite team.

The first of many inside-jokes is when Ice Cube's grouchy Captain of the 22 Jump Street's new abandoned church location comments on how no one thought the first "reboot" (referring to the church within the movie, but not really) would actually work like it did... And now they're piling more money into this new one (again quasi-referring to the church) Something sequels actually have to do to win over audiences, a second time.

The intentionally mirrored storyline of Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko in college lacks the suspenseful undercover element of keeping their identities secret: Not only do they constantly shrug off the mission at hand finding the drug dealer that sold to a girl who fatally overdosed but the students they're involved with are equally pointless and unmotivated.

Jenko bonds with a fellow football jock while Schmidt scores (much too easily) with a girl way out of his league. The twist on who that girl's related to provides some laughter but the joke gets old after a while. As do the bromantic metrosexual comparisons about the bickering cop-partners being in and out of a close relationship... You're straight but seem otherwise: We get it already! 

The best scenes take place after the weary college story peters out Not like it had any real juice in the first place Hell, even their current psychedelic overdose is lame and contrived. So when the boys infiltrate Spring Break/Mexico there's a neat burst of overboard sequel-action to make us forget two things: 22 isn't as good as the first venture, and the first 3/4ths of this movie isn't very good at all.

All these reviews are bashing the crap out of this movie. 'It's aimless drivel and only for mindless idiots'. Well....Yeah. When I watch a comedy like this that's what I hope for. Sometime you just want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half and watch two familiar "actors" play out ridiculous but easy enough to grasp scenarios while they foolishly react. A post-viewing critique is pointless because the directors have no intention of it being able to hold up on creative or any kind of artistic merit. If you want to think about what you're watching, or enjoy good story development, or simply see some great acting then there are plenty of movies like Rashomon, Eraserhead, The Man from Earth, Memories of Murder, Hitchcock films, Miyszaki films, or something like Life Is Beautiful or It's A Wonderful Life(I forget which is which, both great). And there's nothing wrong with a good documentary know and then either. But something good and properly stupid can be just the right thing when you need to take a respite. Not all comedies are going to be a quipping Woody Allen flicks. It's really about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right one for your current mood. In other words this movie is just what it intends to be and just what wanted it to be. Pure and easy entertainment.

...Now I'm going to get my Audrey Hepburn on and watch My Fair Lady.

11 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 22 Jump Street. This film was a hoot!!! I only watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend in preparation for the sequel and although I enjoyed it I have to say the sequel was much better. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a great double act and the film provides just the right amount of slapstick humour combined with witty banter and the serious side of undercover police work. Imagine if you will two undercover cops, not the brightest pair, sent back to college to infiltrate the latest drug ring. Whatever you are imagining.....it's in this sequel. Hill and Tatum are tight.....they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution.......Spring Break. A giggle from start to finish and Channing Tatum's not bad to look at either. Stay for the credits!!!!

Quickie Review:

After a successful undercover drug bust operation in high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) get their next big assignment. Now in the sequel 22 Jump Street, as Ice Cube so eloquently put it, these "two sons of b***hes are going to college." As the cop duo take on yet another drug ring, they go through multitude of ridiculous yet hilarious situations. In doing so, there are some formulaic traps that the movie does fall into. Despite that, it is just an incredible ride with non-stop laughter and great comedic chemistry between the lead actors. This is a must-see for fans of 21 Jump Street and people who generally like to laugh.

Full Review:

The original movie, 21 Jump Street, was a surprise hit back in 2012. It was a movie filled with many belly aching moments of laughter. For that reason, of all the comedies of 2014 this sequel may be the most anticipated, at least it was for me. So the question is: does it deliver on the high expectations? And the answer is: oh hell yes it does.

There is one absolute in this franchise that no one will dispute, the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. Then when they do go about their shenanigans, numerous twists and turns occur that are fun to watch unfold, to hilarious effect. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity. The combination of the comedic duo and the intelligent humor work flawlessly, making the flick all the more entertaining. As great as the two leads are with their comedic timing, I need to especially mention Ice Cube. I won't spoil anything of course, but there are points in this movie where Ice Cube actually steals the scenes he is in. I'd pay the full movie ticket price just to see that dynamic between Ice Cube and the two leads. It is that good.

I do recognize there are some faults with 22 Jump Street. It did stick with the philosophy of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." In that sense, the general story plot is pretty much the same as the original movie. 22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. Still, I think this is something that you can easily look past because of how enjoyable the movie is.

The one purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills that requirement consistently throughout the movie. By throughout the movie, I mean even during the credits. Your cheeks will have a good exercise, because mine were in pain with all the laughing. It is well worth your time and money, so don't miss out on this one. If they keep this up I will be there even at 1022 Jump Street.

Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22 Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series.

Really IMDb? 7.4? How how how. Having read some other reviews clear some folks are getting paid to write positive feedback. Some reviews talk about laughing non-stop all the way through - that is simply not possible. 

This film is a total shocker, and I quite liked the first one. Turned it off after 45 excruciating minutes.

Was clear after 10 minutes or so the film was a simple repeat of the first, but with far less humour. This is without doubt the worst film I have seen in the last 5 years, perhaps longer. 

Assume the actors must have been getting very well paid to want to be associated with this utter dross.

When I was about to give up on modern comedies, here comes a sequel that outdoes the original ten times or more. Tatum is excellent as the slowest of the pair, proving he's a very good comedian, both physically and delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie, and his partner, Hill, redeems himself from the depths of "Wolf" with a turn that shows how talented he can be. His multidimensional geek fully forms a perfect whole with the physical and sweet jock turn by Tatum.

Before we can catch our breaths, the leads are back in school, this time in college trying to stop the viral distribution of a new drug. We all know how it will turn out, but the set up is to put these two in an environment where they will not fit because of the obvious. Hill, well spins his character in a different dimension and takes on a romantic and bromantic persona. His romance and break up scenes rank way up there with the zaniness of "Some Like it Hot", and we are not prepared even in the more open times for some of the exchanges between the two actors when every other lines has a double meaning. This is classic comedy. In particular, the scene in the psychologist office had the audience laugh out loud because absolutely no one on screen was tuned to the same channel, and it kept getting funnier and funnier. For a moment, I thought I was watching "Tootsie" and some of its best bits when the main character was having a nightmarish experience. This time, Hill and Tatum do an amazing job by taking their bromance into new levels.

Tatum is definitely having the time of his life, as he finds his soul mate in school and apparently his destiny in life. Here he is living his dream, succeeding at every possible endeavor, being popular, sharing every moment with his newly found friend. This is serious competition for his undercover buddy, and the writers take flight with it when we see the reactions in Hill's face and their further exchanges.

The silly action scenes and the vulgarity that peppers and ruins much of what they call comedy nowadays take a second seat to the development of characters here. We're not sitting listening to boring expositions or innumerable descriptions of bathroom humor. Yes, those elements are carefully placed, and what comes out is the silliness, the naivete and stupidity of how the characters deal with their relationships with each other. What might have been vulgar in another film, here ranks with some of the best comedy in the movies. There are many tributes and references to those films throughout "22". Be ready to acknowledge the talents of Allen, Benny H., and a few others as winks are given to the audience. This might not be highbrow comedy, but it is beautifully delivered. Much of the credit once again goes to the incredible work by Tatum and the fine support Hill gives him. You will be laughing out loud over and over.

There is one scene that has the explosion of a parent in a visitation day, and Ice Cub's outburst is one of the funniest ever on film. His rantings and reactions to a sudden realization about something one of his undercover agents has done was a moment to treasure because of his excellent timing and the rest of the cast's facial reactions. Whoever wrote the screenplay did his homework and made sure that the skeleton didn't go in without every other element to make a fantastic comedy. So many times we have been given trash, full of unnecessary and stupid jokes that are more shocking than funny. The recent "Neighbors" being a prime example of everything that can go wrong with miscasting, misfired lines, and lazy direction.

To close, there is beauty in all kinds of art. We have incredible harmonies in rock and heavy metal anthems. Class and perfection doesn't only occur in historical and pretentious comedies. Those are bound to be disappointments because they appeal to people who think only a particular type of productions should be considered fine entertainment. Some of the classics surprised us because we didn't expect much at first, but we felt pleased, entertained, and we were moved with the depth of what lied behind the the facade. "22" is a whole piece to be savored and enjoyed, and to laugh out loud, too.

HAVE FUN!!!!

Keeping this brief, this is no doubt the funniest film I've seen since the turn of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing "Ride Along", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.

Expect non-stop entertainment as excellent humour is mixed with an interesting yet simple plot, heartfelt moments and exciting action. My only complaint would be that at times it felt a little recycled from the first film. Though having enjoyed that I wasn't too fussed. 

More than worth your moneys worth. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then you'd be mad not to see this.

This movie was terrible. I can't say one good thing about it. There was absolutely nothing funny about it. I like both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, but they were awful in this. Even the whole drug plot was just dumb.

Action scenes were just lame and even the bad guys were just so unoriginal. And having 2 cops jealous of each other while undercover in college. I think a 9 year old could have written a better story. I mean who came up with the octopus in the beginning, terrible.

FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst big budget movie in a long time. Don't waste 2 hours of your life.

Rented this movie with the expectations of it being 'something'.. after seeing the first movie, figured there could be the potential for an equal type movie; witty, strong acting, fast paced, a good story line etc etc.. sadly, not the case.. from the very first moment it was BAD.. had the same appeal as all bad spoof movies; scary movies 1, 2 & 3, others - can't believe these 'serious' big names in Hollywood agreed to such drivel - expected so much more... whats amazing is that it holds this 7 out of 10 rating- how? if it even got to 4 it would be twice its real worth.. sad state we are in when this trash rates that high.. so many people are so easily impressed these days.. must be all the fluoride in the water they are drinking!

Not even a few funny scenes justify my time spent on watching this. This movie is insult for the brain. Don't get me wrong, I like my brain to be insulted, but this movie remains to float in awkward space between acknowledged trash movie (like "The Room") and around-the-threshold teen comedy like "American Pie" or similar.

It's full of forcing frayed jokes. Combined with unpolished story this is more similar to a comedy series like "A Bit of Fry & Laurie" except that later series has high quality jokes, and not something pulled out from bag-of-teen-movie-jokes. This movies "story" is more like collection of fragments from several stories glued with a bad jokes.

I could not stand watching this film. It took four hours of my life to get through it as I was so bored, I would pause it to do other things. There was not one laugh. The acting was one bad joke after another. The good reviews for this trash are beyond sane. Do not waste a minute of your life on this garbage. I thought the first version was OK and got through it, even though this kind of film is not my taste at all. It really bothers me when filmmakers, and I do include the actors in this, assume we will indulge them in their silly inside jokes and amateurish bits that get recycled over and over. 

I don't think that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have much to offer, but sadly this may be them at their best..one bad sight gag after another. I just wish that I was warned about just how bad it could be.

22 Jump Street for me came off as a total money grab, with not much effort being put in by those involved, especially the writers. The story is basically the same as 21 Jump Street with minor variations, and the humor basically consists of references to the first film. The new setting of college is not really taken advantage of, and it doesn't feel that much different from the first film. Also, whereas the first film played as a spoof of buddy cop dramas, 22 Jump Street just felt merely like a bad buddy cop drama. We don't watch these films for the action. Tatum and Hill are not given much to work with, and they tended to get kind of sappy. Definitely not worth your money

If there's one criticism I have about 22 Jump Street, it's that the movie feels too similar to 21 Jump Street. But is that really a complaint? With 22 Jump Street, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie) have created a massively entertaining ride, with more antics from the characters we love, and better performances all around.

This time around, they're going to college. Yeah, yeah, we've heard it before. As Ice Cube says at the end of the first film, in which the two went undercover at a high school, the tables have been turned and they're going to college now. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) must once again go undercover at MC State to bust another drug operation, this time called WHYPHY (work hard? yes. play hard? yes.)

What worked with 21 Jump Street works again in 22 Jump Street. The excellent characters of Schmidt and Jenko are once again paired to make a hilarious and charismatic duo. Their personalities clash once more, but in a different way than the first film, and they get into even more crazy shenanigans than before. This includes having a shootout in the university library and busting a Spring Break beach party. 22 Jump Street always keeps you on edge, wondering what will happen next. While the plot is pretty standard and similar to the first film, you'll want to stick around because you love these characters so much. New characters such as Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Mercedes (Jillian Bell) feel right at home within the crazy cast. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is also in rare form, delivering some of the film's best moments.

This is a testament to Hill and Tatum, who put so much work into creating these characters. Jenko settles into the football team, and makes friends at a fraternity, while Schmidt performs slam poetry and does many walks of shame. Hill and Tatum are in top form. Their chemistry is better than ever, making 22 Jump Street a hilarious buddy comedy. Try not to laugh when Schmidt does slam poetry to impress a girl, I dare you.

What makes 22 Jump Street feel special is its self-referential attitude and countless meta jokes. Police chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) essentially explains why this movie was made within the first 10 minutes, saying "no one cared about the Jump Street reboot, but you guys got lucky." It's a funny way to be self-deprecating and hilarious at the same time. It plays to the audience's intelligence, rather than making them feel stupid. Other references are more subtle, like when Schmidt keeps asking about the film's budget. It all plays into a very interesting and unique humor style. While there are plenty of raunchy jokes (right in the crack), the film's best come from its self-referencing.

So, now for the all-important question: is 22 Jump Street better than the original? With its meta jokes and its excellent characterization, 22 Jump Street is a rousing success, and matches the original in sheer humor. But the plot feels too similar to the original. While this may be a fault in the film's format, a few more twists would have been appreciated. Still, 22 Jump Street is a hilarious ride, one definitely worth taking.

So this movie could have been a lot better. I did appreciate the recap of the first movie, but for some reason this second one didn't really have me entertained. The movie was kinda cliché and showed how karma happens with Jonah not being the cool kid and Channing being the cool kid as oppose to the first one. This movie needed better jokes and a lot less puns. For example the "giant cube of ice" kinda made me cringe a little bit. As I continued to watch the movie I thought things were going to be a lot better, but in my opinion the movie got worse and worse. I really tried to see the comedy in the whole thing, but it wasn't really getting to me. As much, as the movie had the silly parts and the bad jokes it could have used some work. The money could have been used to make a better movie than this.

I've always seen IMDb as the holy grail of reviews; with the exception of the Horror genre, the rating of a movie is usually spot-on. At the time of writing, 22 Jump Street has 7.3 and I don't understand how. 

21 Jump Street was bearable and had its moments. However, 22 shows no real refinement of the first; in fact all I considered when watching it was the half-baked movies before pioneering comedy originals such as 40 year old virgin and Superbad.

The humour was bromidic, overused and almost as silly as some of the dreadful spoofs nowadays. Like most sequels, it seems the script writers have jumped on the success of the first movie; the same gags, plot and situational embarrassment, which begs the question, why make another!?

As a side note, Jonah Hill is a rising star with amazing potential, acting in supporting roles such as Wolf of Wall Street which he rightly deserved an Oscar nomination. I get it that comedies are his thing. However, this is not just an all-time-low for Hill in regards to comedies, but an insult to his talent for more auspicious roles.

this movie is brutal. I cannot believe anyone finds it the least bit entertaining. Jonah Hill is even worse then he was in 'The Sitter' and Channing Tatum is even worse. If anyone wants to see a "Buddy Cop Movie" go rent 'Lethal Weapon' tat herd is not one scene that makes me even smile ( let alone laugh), and the action scenes are not exciting either. Mercedes might be the lamest villain ever ( she makes a 'Scooby Doo' enemy look sinister ( the fist fight between her and Jonah Hill is especially stupid)). 

I really cannot see any purpose, rhyme or reason behind this movie, because it neither excites, makes me laugh or anything else.?it just might be the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and I have seen thousands.

Had I seen this when it was a new release, I'd have thought it was a small patch on a very tired genre: the Hollywood buddy cops comedy. The plot's nothing new--undercover cop starts to sympathize with the dapper gangster/drug dealer he's trying to nab--but the homoerotic elements, an arguable subtext in even the most serious films in this genre, are writ so large and loud here that they threaten to squirt you in the eye (ahem). The filmmakers probably though it would be funny to make explicit what other films only suggest, but the joke wears thin right around the moment that one of the leads feeds the other a live-squid-on-a-stick (a uniquely Korean treat) held at crotch level, and minions outside see the seemingly fellatial event in silhouette against the window blinds. Hmmm. There IS an explosive diarrhea gag that made me laugh, but then I felt really guilty afterwards. Good looking film, but total garbage.

This stuff is right up my alley too. But, 22 Jump Street is a shred of the original,.. a terribly written, unfunny mess of a sequel.

FOr me it instantly becomes one of the, imo, most-painfully- overrated movies on this sight. This film doesn't deserve to see the light of a 6-point-something rating, let-alone a 7-pt-something... No chemistry between the characters... everything that made me think the original was mindless hilarity, is painfully absent here.

Definitely pass on this one. FIne with turning the rehashed idea into a self-aware, template sequel, but the omission of "laughter" seals the deal for this piece of junk.

I love stupid comedies, I love sex romps, buddy comedies, AND I really enjoyed the first one, but this film is as bland as an unsalted, plain baked potato. The best thing for me to do is forget this was ever made and watch the original a few years down the road.

Painful.

that would be my one word review if I could have left one.

38/100 Will go down as one of the worst of the year without question. OUt of about 35-40 2014 releases I've seen so far - this is probably the second worst film I've seen, and in terms of disparity from the IMDb score... something is rotten in denmark... 7.3? I'm at a loss. Terrible, terrible movie. Expect a slow, but steady decline into 6.5-land, and it doesn't deserve that.

To think that this now sits next to "Anchorman"(7.3),and "Swingers"(7.4) on the career ratings, is simply dumbfounding... a little disturbing actually. Another reviewer said 'lazy film- making'... that sums up the issue with this.

If you're no longer a pubescent, wear boxers not briefs and subscribe to the idea that things get better with age - such as your self... then don't waste your time and money on this thing. I rented it and watched about the first 20 minutes of it then gave up. It's got to be high up on the list of containing the stupidest dialog you'll ever hear. The movie Dumb and Dumber had wittier dialog. I'm not really a Channing Tatum fan but I know he's capable of better film roles and I actually began feeling embarrassed for the guy in this flop. Did he lose a bet or something? As far as Jonah Hill... erm... think I'll just stop there.
