### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I was looking forward to this since the moment I saw the trailer and so got myself out of bed for the 10:05 am showing on opening day. It looked funny, like 'Shaun of the Dead,' and seemed to have its own interesting take, which is rare in the zombie genre. Usually the plots of zombie films are about as aimless as the zombies. The best way to describe this film is a zombie romantic comedy. It does have some action and some tense moments later on but the initial set up is the zombie, R's, emotional growth and how meeting this girl sparks something in him to evolve. This is nothing like 'Twilight,' and those that are saying that have either not seen it or are too absorbed in the fact that the two leads are good looking, which is the only commonality this film has with 'Twilight.'But, let's face it, the majority of leads in films are attractive, so, that's not much to base a similarity on. 'Shaun of the Dead' was just a comedy, where this is a comedy with heart and depth. It's a satire, but they don't force feed the point of the film, instead they make it very subtle, which is nice.

It wasn't a laugh-out-loud comedy, but I don't know that I necessarily thought it would be when I saw the trailer. It definitely had more emotional depth than I thought it would which gave me a much fonder attachment to the film than if it had simply been made for laughs. The two leads had great chemistry and were believable and well cast. The directing, writing, and pretty much everything in the film was well done. I have no complaints. It delivered what it said it would and exceeded my expectations which is rare these days in entertainment.

This movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go see this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute way. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and romantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but this movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was entertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair team were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone. I suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see this movie!

'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of the zombies.

The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better  there's depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen  the film entertains you from start to finish.

Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do this role  especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame because he can be really funny.

Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary  particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny and even heart-warming sometimes.

Going into Jonathan Levine's (50/50, The Wackness) new film Warm Bodies, I was intrigued. I didn't know quite what I was going to get as the concept was fresh and unique.

Zombies have taken over, yet one zombie, named R, played wonderfully by Nicholas Hoult has a mind of his own and is not your typical zombie. He has a conscious mind at work, and soon he falls for a pretty girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) that he encounters.

This is where the movie puts a twist on the whole zombie genre. He soon becomes enamored by her and becomes more human, as she has stimulated his heart. Can a zombie find solace with another person and...love? That is the main theme of this movie, and it's a damn good one.

Their chemistry will draw you in and actually make you buy it, no matter how ridiculous it is. R's friend, M, played hilariously by Rob Corddry steals the show with funny scene after funny scene.

With Warm Bodies you get a mix of comedy, romance, and zombie-horror. It's a fresh spin on all three, and it was truly a fun time at the theater. It's well paced and has a great feel to it from the get-go, mostly in part to wonderful narration from Holt, and smooth direction from Levine.

It's only February but I already found one of my early favorites of 2013.

Finally the great zombie romance? Well, maybe not, but it's the closest I've seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie, who starts to get feelings for a girl who's alive. Through a set of circumstances, he "rescues" her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words, but weirdly, in his head, he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking, therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn't impressed by it, but at least it was slow-building, somewhat charming, avoiding most of the disgusting stuff, and you kind of rooted for them by the end.

Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can "evolve" (our hero) or "devolve" (bonies, zombies who shed their outer skins, looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons). Speaking of bonies, I thought they looked amazing, creepy even, but their movements were stiff and made them look computer-generated. Also, who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate, through visions. It's not even the only way they can "change", although the other way, though nice, seemed a bit far-fetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic, hopeful even, vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There's something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think, however the execution wasn't flawless.

Sure, overall, I found the movie had charms, but for me the laughs were few and far between, like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it's supposed to be one of those, but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more "teeth" to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo & Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands, not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode, which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn't follow their own internal rules. We're told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly, yet not long after, we see zombies running. It's like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also, I know it's a short movie, but zombies "evolve" too quickly, especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good, not exceptional, but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he's a nice, smart freak, quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions, but able to be slowly "healed" by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes, the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude, not fitting in, and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.

Zombie makeup was rather minimal, and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive, in a goth-like way, mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept, but it could have been done much, much worse. So, I liked the movie, I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It's very minimally bloody and the most "gory" part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie, and even that's not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn't leave me cold and the more I dwell on it, the warmer my feelings for it get.

Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)

I went to see "Warm Bodies" on opening night, something I rarely do. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed in this strangely romantic comedy. Don't be turned off by the premise of a zombie romantic comedy - it manages to parody human relationships on many levels the way "Shaun of the Dead" parodied zombie movies. Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to connect, yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie's comedy. He manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the bromance if you will, and I didn't even catch his part in aiding the Shakespearian nod. Yes, this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare while also light-heartedly setting out themes for what defines a person as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be going to see it again. I was too busy laughing to see the plot holes.

I also have purposefully avoided reading the book, so I wouldn't have any preconceived notions of the movie. I get that the book was much darker than the film, which would set a viewer up for disappointment in a romantic comedy.

And they said you couldn't have a zombie romance story. Take that vampires! 

The zombie R was surprisingly strong, but sensitive, sweet, loving, and protective. He wanted to talk to the pretty girl but had trouble finding the words, or at least vocalizing them. His determination and frantic antics were endearing.

Julie was not some wussy victim or brainless babe. It made me happy to see she was tough and could take care of herself. She had a rebellious streak that made her entertaining to watch and a softer affectionate side that showed itself with R.

I can honestly say I liked both characters and wanted to see them succeed. 

I particularly enjoyed the scenes where R eats the brains and we saw more of Julie, her old boyfriend, her father, and how they all fit together. It was heart felt and well-done. The relationships and the complexity of them was less evident in the movie than in the book but I could still feel it. If you liked the movie I highly suggest reading the book, by the way.

Warm Bodies was well paced and acted, and one of the better zombie movies I have seen. Watch it, and provided you aren't dead inside, be overcome by it's cuteness! I can't say enough times - read the book! Read the book! Read the book! Okay I'm done.

When I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be another teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of her boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand new type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you with your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great for family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest and the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie, that will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of entertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of course, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a little boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to see with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English, i'm from other country.

Here's something you don't see every day: A romantic comedy involving zombies. Thus, "Warm Bodies", a fresh, fast-paced, sensational and truly original delight that is sure to knock your socks off from beginning to end. Start with the premise: After an plague has caused people to turn into zombies, the real humans including General Grigio (John Malkovich) separate themselves from the brain-eating zombies by building up a wall in order to keep them away. Along the way, we get to meet one of those zombies. Meet R (the charming British heartthrob Nicholas Hoult). He doesn't quite like this life, knowing that he has to eat brains in order to survive and to live off the memories of the humans he's killed. He's looking for someone to connect to, which is really explained through his facial expressions and inner monologues. Then it's love at first bite, when he's finally connecting to Julie (Australian beauty Teresa Palmer), daughter of General Grigio. When he sees her after she shoots most of his friends, he decides to protect her and to "keep her safe". Yes, this zombie is in love. Protecting her in his abandoned airplane filled with vinyl records, a record player, and other resourceful things, R finally gets to realize that something was missing in him all along, leaving his heart beating to realize that he loves her. That's when R, his friend M (a wonderful Rob Corddry) and the other zombies are starting to change. That's all good, until the CG skeletal creatures known as Bonies will do anything to prevent that from happening, which leads off into the film's fantastical climax. "Warm Bodies", directed by Jonathan Levine (of the delightful comedy-drama "50/50" and the incredibly wicked "The Wackness"), who also adapted the film from Isaac Marion's bestselling book for young adults, combines a mixture of 5 different genres (comedy, horror, romance, drama, even a little bit of sci-fi) that makes the film more smarter and even more better than "The Twilight Saga". (Take that, Jacob Black.) What also makes it work is the inspired casting of Nicholas Hoult from "About a Boy", "X-men: First Class" and the upcoming "Jack the Giant Slayer". As R, he literally dives deep into the emotions as well as having terrific comic timing through his expressions and his inner monologues by using a spot-on American accent. He also develops great chemistry with Teresa Palmer, known as the butt-kicking alien Six in "I Am Number Four", who, as Julie, has a tough and fearless personality as well as a emotional side to her. The supporting cast is also incredible, including Analeigh Tipton, who is hilarious as Julie's friend, Nora, Dave Franco (James's little brother from last year's "21 Jump Street") who gets a brief amount of screen time, but really sticks it out as Julie's ex-boyfriend, Perry, who (in order not to spoil this) gets called for a dinner date that includes brains on the menu and the great John Malkovich excels as a man who believes that the zombies are nothing more than just flesh-eating corpses looking forward to get shot in the head, but doesn't believe that his only daughter is in love with one. I know what you're thinking, this is just another zombie movie. But "Warm Bodies" is certainly different than that. It revives the zombie genre by bringing something original to the screen. For those who love the TV series "The Walking Dead" and the other zombie comedies "Zombieland" and "Shaun of the Dead", not to mention George A. Romero "...of the Dead" series, you actually will get a taste of what the zombie world is like through the eyes of one. And maybe like R's, your heart will warm up too. This is the best surprise so far this year. Note: "Warm Bodies" is pretty tame, but pushing the envelope for a PG-13 film involving zombies who eats brains and Bonies who consumes hearts. Those are hardly seen, but there are people who shoot zombies in the head with guns. That works in order to keep it very organic.

This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre unlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or gory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a full-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10 minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Enjoy!

"Warm Bodies" is a comedic, romantic, action-filled zombie flick. Being a zombie movie, people do get chased, attacked, eaten by zombies but since it is PG-13, it's not too graphic. Fun surprise: zombies aren't the only creatures stalking humans in this movie.

This movie opens with a wonderfully fun and clever introduction to the zombie apocalypse as well as the main zombie character named R. Nicholas Hoult's R is funny, loyal, curious, likable, protective, charming. Definitely not a typical zombie. There are many scenes where our zombie friend goes about his daily life, accompanied by hilarious and clever voice overs. It's interesting how he questions everything, thinks constantly, longs to connect. This opportunity arises when he meets Julie, sparking a sort-of Romeo and Juliet type of relationship. Julie is a resistance fighter whose dad (John Malcovich) leads the humans. She is strong and brave yet vulnerable and sweet. The chemistry between R and Julie is undeniable. I can honestly say that I cared what happened to them.

All the actors did a fantastic job. John Malkovich is great as always. Dave Franco's character was quite tragic. Analeigh Tipton is wonderful as Jule's best friend, providing some funny lines and support, though it would have been nice to have more of her. A shout-out to Rob Corddry is required as he has some of the best lines and is just fantastic as a fellow zombie. (Definitely would be on my crew during the zombie apocalypse)

I absolutely recommend "Warm Bodies." It's fun, fast-paced, clever, looks great, has interesting characters, action, some scares, romance. Maybe see with a date or by yourself or a group of friends, up to you.

Warm Bodies is a beauty and the beast love story crossed with the  typical zombie horror flick. The movie's pace is well done and the  movie itself is well directed by the director of the 2011 drama 50/50,  Jonathan Levin. He also wrote the screenplay, which he based on a 2010  novel of the same name (Warm Bodies) by Isaac Marion. 
The acting in the movie is glamorous, from both the humans and the  zombies, and I did enjoy the makeup effect on the lead as he starts to  morph from a zombie to a human. The movies use of humor is well timed  and arranged as it is clever, when you feel it is getting a little too  serious, out of nowhere jumps a comic line that lightens the mood. The  other thing that you will enjoy is the Romeo and Juliet references that  the director made sure were present and obvious, as the lead characters  name is R which I believe R for Romeo and his love interest is named  Julie which I believe is in reference to Juliet. 
The thing that attracted me to this movie in the first place was the  new idea of how the movie is viewed from the zombie's point of view; we  also get to hear his thoughts as he goes through life being an undead. 
Set in a post apocalypse era, Warm Bodies is more about open  mindedness, the ability to accept that others can change. The movie is  more of a romantic drama than it is about humans going all Resident  Evil on Zombies. 
The plot is about an unusual zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who  developed human emotions and craved for more. The humans during this  post apocalypse era lived a barricade life away from zombies who have  practically taking over the world. Part of the human settlement went  out to get some supplies, during that time they ambushed by zombies,  there R saw Julie (Teresa Palmer) and fell for her. 
He then saved her from the others and made her stay with him during  which more emotional attachment developed between the two till she had  to go back to her people. But something new started among the zombies  that one act by R caused a revolution. 
The movies score jumped out at me as being bad though, that is from my  view. The movie is cool, and the humor is really well timed and this is  a movie that I can comfortably advise that you should see.

This is one of those movies which sadly is a feature-length version of its trailer with little more to offer. During the entire movie I kept waiting for the story world to crumble into satire, because I was in disbelief that someone would make a zombie version of Twilight, let alone one this messy. In Warm Bodies (as explained in the trailer) love literally conquers all. R goes for days without eating because of: love. R becomes living again because of: love. R transfers his love/revitalizing powers via...telekinesis(?) to the rest of the zombies because of....love. What kind of love can have that kind of power? Good 'ol American love: he sees a blonde-haired blue-eyed teenager firing a gun and that's it, baby. No one needs to tell the girl what Stockholm Syndrome is, because that would ruin the magic that is their romance.

Don't get me wrong, there were definitely a few laughs here and there but I just kept waiting for that moment where the fourth wall would be shattered! Having at least a little meta content would have been great, adding a tiny bit of intelligence to it all. 2/10

I came into the theatre expecting a coherent ("It's based on a novel so there has to be some consistency" I thought, stupidly) story set in a post-apocalyptic world (it's a zombie movie, after all) with some dark humour thrown into the mix for good measure. What I discovered was an inconsistent, bland, badly acted attempted romance-movie with ridiculous (not in the good way) dialogues.

In short: We meet a zombie (R) who has incredibly coherent thought processes for a zombie, yet chooses to eat brains for sustenance. If this garish action is really necessary we never truly find out, after all he doesn't eat for a week after meeting Julie (the bland, berating love interest badly played by Teresa Palmer), but the movie dismisses this rather vital part of information with the following mind-blowing dialogue.

Julie: Do you have to eat brains? R: Yes

Seriously. 

The movie then goes on about how R is changing, yet the characters seem to ignore this fact - no one seems taken aback in the least that zombies suddenly can talk, even though it's been established that such a thing is impossible. Hell, the fact that they run seems very implausible to me seeing as how the entire intro sequence is dedicated to R telling us how he shuffles around all day and when he goes out to feed he literally says: "this is going to take a while", but I digress.

This is figuratively literally the tip of the iceberg, and just to illustrate this point, this is the way the movie handles the love interest losing her initial boyfriend (whom the movie then tries to turn into a douche bag by making him act like one in a dream sequence so we wouldn't be so creeped out when she makes out with the zombie who ate his brains).

R eats boyfriend's brain. R rescues Julie (by smearing what appears to be poop on her - I guess it was supposed to be blood) through some unexplained process several times. Julie NEVER mentions her ex-boyfriend. Suddenly, in a throw-away line, she explains that it's not that she's not sad - it's just that she prepared for this. Yeah, that's how emotions work.

There are still loads of things to point out (for instance how rotting zombies become super-human monsters once they totally flip out and become 'skellies'), but I hope my point has gotten across. The only reason I give this movie more than 1/10 is the way Analeigh Tipton says 'Sup?' to the zombie R when he (successfully) wins Julie back after having explained to her that he ate her boyfriend's brain, but has now walked a couple of miles so it should be okay.

In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie without recollections but very introspective.

R eats Perry's brain and revives his memories and sensations with Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her. Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them.

"Warm Bodies" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story in worthwhile; the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with the cover of Lucio Fulci's "Zombie" in Blu-Ray is cult; and in the end I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.

What if zombies had thoughts running through their heads as they lunged around? And what if you made a movie from their pov? That seems to have been the whole concept here, and a story was worked out. The idea itself is a good one, not unlike the Tucker and Dale movie from last year, and perhaps long due. Horror, effective horror, has been all about placing us closer to the nature of the horrific experience, it's why as early as the 1960's, monsters were dragged from swamps and castles and moved next door to Bates motel.

And what better placement than making us the monster?

So they could have this as a black comedy, and I'd be a happy viewer. We'd see all those situations we know from zombie movies, but from behind the zombie mist of dumb instincts looking out at human instincts, in a way that drove home the absurdity and dumbness, drawing the same parallels that Romero did in his time. We are in Romero's timeline anyway, Land of the Dead.

But for reasons that strike me as more shrewd than creative, they decided this should be a romantic movie. The idea here is to have the zombie narrator as one of the target audience, a teenager baffled at the 'deadness' of modern life, a music geek and awkward with the girl he loves, stuttering every time. Clever so far. 

Where it completely loses me as a viewer, is that the decision was made, and this had to have been part of a shrewd business plan, that there is currently no better mode to rope more of that teenage audience than Twilight. The franchise has come and gone, but the ripples are still being felt, especially in a film like this.

What the Twilight influence means is that there is the angle of forbidden love, forbidden because of social constructs. They found a mopey, Kristen Stewart lookalike to be the sullen heroine. There is a more elaborate mythos, introducing zombies which are more evil than 'regular' ones. And it all has to culminate with an 'epic' battle and redemptive aftermath. Worst of all, and this is why I rate the film so low, is that mopey, wistful tone that probably passes as introspection in high-school corridors. There's even the inane visual bit, the equivalent of sparkly vampires, with the hearts of 'awakened' zombies beating red!

You'll know the filmmaker is a dull mind, if you observe the scene, it's a small moment but very indicative, where 'good' zombies have decided to make a stand, rousing Scorpions music kicks in the soundtrack; instead of giving us say a flat, comedic side-shot where zombies simply limp along into the frame one by one, he has them coolly walk towards the camera... in slow motion! 

Which defeats their actual stumbling in slow motion, all so we can have a useless Reservoir Dogs effect.

I walked into this movie not expecting much, but a little something. The intro was pretty nicely done and I expected it to not be as dire and gory as say The Walking Dead or Dawn of the Dead. I also didn't mind the idea that R serves as the narrator even though as a character he can't talk initially. Then the humans come into play. The group R first encounters is pretty much your every-slasher-movie-college-road-trip. There are no signs of any kind of training to fight against zombies or act as a group (yes, like playing Left4Dead with 12yos). I was willing to accept the fact that R would fall for Julie, that's the premise of the movie after all. Then however it starts going downhill.... rapidly. R is housing (as of now I will start counting face palm in brackets, so this is 1) in an abandoned airplane. He is opening the door (2) and keeps Julie there. His love interest in her is somewhat developed but still hard to believe. He slowly learns to speak again, yet when he and Julie encounter other Zombies M completely out of nothing can talk at the same level as R can (3). What follows is the typical drama of them getting to know each other better and her leaving him when he tells her he killed her boyfriend. On a side not here. Julie is maybe the worst female character I have seen in a movie for years. Now I'm a guy, but every feminist must have been going through the roof seeing her. R is constantly saying he will protect her, she cannot take care of herself and instead of properly mourning over her dead boyfriend she befriends R, but then again tries to run away from him and what not. Horrible character. Anyhow, R is going to meet her in the human complex (by this time all of the regular zombies have magically stopped eating humans/brains (4)). R easily gets into the human complex and meets with Julie (yeah, build a concrete wall that is 20m high, but conveniently oversee a gap (5) and don't smell the dead guy in the rotting clothes (6)). A group of bonies attacks the human complex looking for R and Julie, what motivates them is however completely unclear, same as what led them there (7). R and Julie escape from them and eventually leap into a pool, with R serving as a kind of cover for Julie. They get back up and R gets shot in the chest. Now, I don't know what you'd do if the water around you is turning red with the blood of a loved one - Julie however starts screaming happily and enthusiastically that R can bleed (8). Then the zombies befriend the humans, come back to live and blah blah blah (9 ad infinitum).

The movie as a whole has no real suspense. There is little to no violence involved either. R is an interesting character that however gets struck by plot holes, Julie is anything but a character, nothing makes her sympathetic. The other characters are also pretty one dimensional.

Well, that's all I can say. Don't waste your money going to the movies to see this. It is pretty much this year's Prometheus - great trailer, shitty movie. I was very disappointed

This film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies in it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.

I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen friendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we are left with a great ending.

I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also funny, a winner for me.

YES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's better humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type of story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they made it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action scenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its the typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making a Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better yet..Props to the person who wrote it. This definitely makes that OVERRATED Twilight series SUCKS MORE after watching this. I would really recommend watching it.

I love zombie comedies, who doesn't. The horror and action formula is so overused that when you see the same concept in a comedic movie first your brain neglects the truth but as you get used to it you might start liking it. This movie was a great example of that. From start off even the set up is hilariously laughable and it follows from then on. Zombies are already an absurd concept so taking them through a plot like this doesn't hurt anybody. At least it shouldn't. The movie even had touchy moment for me even though it is a semi-absurd comedy.

The writing was great. Jokes never felt out of the place. Zombies and their social chain system was one of the best things in movie. Never managed to bore me. Runtime of 98 minutes was an accurate decision more could become boring and dragged really easily, less could make us feel unfinished. 

The performances were all above the average. Nicholas Hoult is really getting the hang of this monster roles. Being a war-boy in MadMax and The Beast in X-Men he will master it soon. He was great in this as the Zombie. One of the best aspects of this movie was his performance. Him being even a bit weak could make the whole movie go downhill. He is the main zombie after all. The other performances were all believable at their worst but nothing really stood out for me maybe except Rob Corddry's M. 

The make up and movies fluency all added up to these. Great cinematography. This movie was enjoyable.

After seeing a lot of lame comedy this last 5 years this is along with the great ones on my top list. If you haven't definitely recommend you seeing this.

First: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human flesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first 37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time (seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession with trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies, werewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our expectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the actual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I cannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the plethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow reviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are making me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our relationship.

The premise of "Warm Bodies" is both its downfall and its ultimate success. Stuck in the restrictive boundaries of "the undead attempting to regain a connection with the living" only has a place in the far reaches of suspended disbelief provided it's fused with consistent comedy. Fortunately, despite a setup that is almost too fast to be accepted, yet uneventful enough to drag for the impatient, the film results in evenly dispensed amusement and carefully balanced drama. It could have gone terribly, terribly wrong at so many points, but it managed to keep a level head about the production  nothing is too dark or too giddy.

"Why do I have to be so weird?" queries R (Nicholas Hoult), a highly unusual zombie who despite shuffling around a post-apocalyptic metropolis wasteland and snacking on live human flesh, takes moments out of his routine to ponder his existence. He ruminates on what his full name used to be, what professions his cohorts used to have, his bad posture, loneliness, slow movements, inability to effectively communicate with fellow automatons, his future and his past. Just as unexplained as the nation-sweeping phenomena that brought about the eight-year-long uprising of the undead is R's capacity to narrate with such normalcy, but he does so to demonstrate a yearning for connecting with others and figuring out the meaning of life. The dwindling surviving human armies are quick to shoot the zombies, unaware that R represents a possible solution to the horrifying zombification condition. General Grigio (John Malkovich) leads the human fighters, but it's his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer) who accompanies a group of heavily armed, youthful scavengers out into the "dead zone" to forage for medical supplies  only to be ambushed by R and a gathering of hungry zombies.

It's no mystery that the tale of a pale, blood-stained zombie living worlds apart from a rosy-cheeked young woman, each desperately striving to command their feelings for one another, is a take on Romeo and Juliet (several other names correlate with Shakespearean roles, plus a moment towards the end finds Julie perched on a balcony). Occasionally it's not too subtle, but the constant teetering on the edge of ludicrousness and amenable reception concludes in surprising contentment. There's nothing particularly sinister in the composition, and each of the actors contributes sensibility to an otherwise outlandish plot. Palmer is a warmer, more attractive version of "Twilight's" Bella, quickly coming to terms with the supernatural element of R's uncommon dexterity, while Hoult imparts a steadfast performance that doesn't frequent the sense of absurdity and havoc that this story would wreak on fans of George A. Romero's horror creations.

But "Warm Bodies" comes at a time when zombie infestations are still a novel idea, riding on the popularity of such efforts as "The Walking Dead" and "Zombieland" (with a sequel opening this year), as well as the upcoming reboot of the "Evil Dead" franchise (also this year). The transition from staggering masses of tattered sleepwalkers consuming bloodied corpses to a similarly hypnotized yet humanized brain-sucking teen nervously wooing a pouty-lipped blonde, takes some getting used to; but once the silliness is subdued the affecting romance is largely worthwhile. Is there a metaphor lurking under the light-hearted adventure and simply sweet relationship? The setting leaves little wiggle room for shocking revelations, justifiable fidgeting over inconsistencies in zombie behavior, or outcomes more intense than happily-ever-after, but the greatest accomplishment is merely to present a zombie movie shown from a zombie perspective (based on the book by Isaac Marion). That's impressively unique.

1.) so much inaccuracy and stupidity, it really shouldn't have been a zombie movie. doesn't work 2.) R cant remember his name or the past but can eloquently think to himself like the bard himself. 3.) all the zombies shuffle. even R. but then he will just walk like a normal human at the START of the movie and have beyond human fast reflexes to bring down julie's boyfriend 4.) at the start of the movie R says "they call these guys boney's". so the zombies were that smart already? To create names? 5.) no one can smell without brain function. these zombies sniffed out the humans in the beginning. 6.) R's vocab skyrockets in 1 day. OK, it furthers the story... but if thats what it takes, don't make it a zombie flick 7.) the zombies adopt julie in their pack on the way back to the airport, then the ones at the airport don't sniff her out. what is going on with the consistency THIS IS ALL IN THE FIRST 30 MINUTES 8.) the kids walked from city to gather medicine from the clinic. how far could they have made it that julie had to drive a night back? 9.) how large was the tank of gas in the car that allowed them to drive all night? 10.) why did julies companions all leave the clinic instead of staying to fight the 10 zombies? 11.) how much cognition do the boney's have that they have a vendetta against R and julie? And why should R care? Why go back? 12.) whoever plays julie IS kristen stewart in twilight. awful. 13.) R saves julie by sacrificing himself as her cushion falling into the pool. julie first swims to the surface, doesn't worry to just grab him and bring him up too 14.) internal organs dead and atrophied for months and years do not simply just come back to life.

Why? Dear lord, why is this movie rated over seven? Are the humanity seriously that retarded? Can people no longer separate good from bad? These are just some of the questions I am left with after watching this.

First of all, this movie should have been a parody, not a romantic comedy! The movie had been easier to accept if it was in a different genre. For example like «Shaun of the Dead». In that case I would totally accept the zombie-human love thing going on (NOT). Although there is humor in Warm Bodies, and it's clearly a movie that wants to be taken seriously, I do not buy the over all story!

Secondly, I get really embarrassed over how this so-called "dialogue" through the film is written. Moaning, "yes" and groaning "not safe" is totally not necessary. This could have been solved less awkward by letting the character show how he feels/thinks through something else, for example music (since they already have made a big scene about this, which I personally don't think evolved as good as it could).

Furthermore, I think the movie is wrong in terms of how zombies actually are. Zombies are, as they're in ALL the other movies and books on this subject  dead creatures. They do not live, they do not think and they certainty do not feel! But most of all THEY DO NOT SPEAK! They react only by instincts, and that instinct tells them to eat your face of.

I get the fact that this is a movie where the zombie boy gets "feelings", so I will not criticize that further on. But why didn't they just give him these human attributes along with him growing a heart? Why let him moan through phrases that would even get the heavy addicts uncomfortable?

I think a lot of this could have been solved to the better if the genre of this movie was a parody, as I stated previously. It would certainty be more fun to watch, and maybe I would actually laugh of the horrible scenes that was made to be funny and not feel the urge to scratch out my eyes and ears..

Warm Bodies is in fact a movie about a zombie who falls in love with his dinner. If that's not awkward enough  A post-apocalyptic Romeo and Juliet story is! Yes, I see the reference. I AM NOT BLIND! (yet, but I could be if I see this movie again) The world's most famous lovers will always be used as inspiration for love stories; I understand that, but really, WHY? WHY couldn't this have been done with a little more sophistic or finesse? Do the producers even have a brain, or did the zombies eat it?

Do not watch this BRAIN DEAD move if you have a beating heart. If you want to see something dead become a "real boy", I recommend Pinocchio

I really, really wanted to like this movie. I liked the idea of the perspective shift, the trailer narration presents R as an interesting misfit, a little too alive to be a zombie and much too dead to be anything else. I love a good horror-comedy, and what better to poke fun at then undead romance? The storyline centers around a near future where the unspecified virus breaks loose and the remaining humans build a fortress to keep out the zombies. It adds its own twist that zombies, while some stay conscious like the hero, R, others simply give up hope, and become the 'Bonies'; a skeletal group of who are merciless and bloodthirsty, you know, like a zombie. So in that, I guess I was thinking there was a good set up for some more psychological conflict, especially if it's supposed to be based off of Romeo and Juliet where people do, you know, *actually* die.

I don't know why I was expecting so much. I was already expecting zombies, but none of them have so much as a missing hand or a vacant eye socket. It's the equivalent of the glittering vampire; unmutilated zombies, who are pale, blue eyed, and stare longingly. Of all the plot holes you could drive a convertible through, that one bothered me the most. To be fair, I think one of the little kid zombies was missing teeth.

I would give you a synopsis of this movie but there doesn't seem to be a point. It's pretty typical boy meets girl, falls in love, overcomes differences. As for being a comedy, the plot is too straight forward for anything besides a few cheap laughs. It takes itself too seriously to poke fun at things like Julie's controlling father, or how awkward zombie kisses could be, and not seriously enough to give any kind of emotional depth to the characters. The relationship between Julie and R reminded me much more of Tarzan and Jane than Romeo and Juliet.

I suppose if you're looking for a fun date movie with the all the appeal of the word zombie and none of the gore, horror or anything relevant to the title, and you're still in high school, this movie has appeal. Maybe if you read the book you'll have some appreciation that I didn't. If you have to do your own laundry, or have ever had a relationship with any real emotional substance, Warm Bodies will at best leave you feeling a bit tepid.
