### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This padded-out feature would have made a very good short. There are good scenes, and ideas worth considering, but absolutely not enough of them for a feature. The stop-motion and design are great, but it has problems on the story/art/intellect side because of stretching the run time past what the story/themes can bear.

Too many of the scenes (whether attempts at exploring the humdrum, or attempts at absurdist conflict) subtract more than they add to the whole. The main metaphor of a Fregoli delusion well-represents a kind of mid-life crisis, but it also loses quite a bit in flattening out the mid-life crisis into a general alienation (granted, with a mix of older existentialism issues, and newer ones such as 'personhood as illusory'). In a short film, this bare-bones metaphor would have enough of a poetic quality to work. But here, when the story is stretched out, we are constantly reminded of the lack of particulars. And at some point, not telling us more about the main character and his problems is just coy or frigid on Kaufman's part.

I should note that I have no problem with the main character being unsympathetic, nor the attempt at exploring the humdrum side of life in many scenes, nor the film's plot/conclusions being flat/troubling/puzzling, nor scenes that aren't always "entertaining". But those scenes have to do something besides show you that dull dialogue imitates dull talk in life. And if Kaufman was interested in tone/lyricism, theme, and irony OVER human particulars (and therefore other things that art can do), he was obliged to take careful, un-self-indulgent account of what the story could sustain. For the second film in a row, he hasn't.

I see why, on the the business side, this CAN'T be a $3M short when you can make a $10M feature instead. But this has no bearing on whether the feature has problems. And I understand why a lack of human particulars is fitting for puppets (and how from an ironic, existentialist and behaviorist point-of-view, we might be more puppets than we care to admit), but a few modern ideas don't automatically make 90 minutes worth of story.

"Anomalisa" is in my opinion one of this year's most important films. The film centres on Michael Stone, a depressed customer service guru who struggles to connect with others, finally meeting someone he can truly connect with - a woman named Lisa.

Anyone familiar with Kaufman's work knows that he has a tendency to write incredibly deep and complex stories embedded with a plethora of themes. "Anomalisa" might just be the one exception (or anomaly) to that fact. The story is surprisingly simple; most of it takes place over the course of 24 hours. The messages behind it, fortunately, will still require multiple viewings and further analysis in order to be fully grasped. The final synthesis is elegantly woven to near perfection and is at times humorous and even thrilling. Running at only 90 minutes, the film never feels slow nor bloated. I believe "Anomalisa" is a good starting point for those just starting to get into Kaufman's filmography.

The stop-motion animation is some of the best that I have ever seen on the big screen. For a project that was funded on Kickstarter, I have to say that the quality of the animation is the equivalent to what you would see in an Aardman Animations or Laika production - if not better. There were certain shots that made me stop and really appreciate the efforts that the team went through just to make all of their characters' movements flow realistically. Kudos to them!

The reasons why I think "Anomalisa" is one of this year's most important films not only have to do with the way the film was financed and produced, but that it also opens up a dialogue on isolation and social disillusionment - they are usually seen as flaws inherent only within the individual, despite the fact that everyone plays some part in furthering it.

"Anomalisa" is a true work of art on many levels. It is a simple story that touches on a wide range of emotions, riddled with the complexities of our perceptions on relationships. Do not be surprised if this film makes you laugh more than cry. Do not be surprised if this film makes you cry more than laugh - for that is the true beauty of this anomaly of a film.

This is a small film  by which I mean it's not a great one. This is, of course, in contrast to all the critical praise which has been heaped on it. The word "masterpiece" has featured in many reviews, but I can't agree. I'd stress that I'm a huge Charlie Kaufman fan and my anticipation on going to see the film was equally as big as my disappointment after I'd done so. So what's the problem? I think it's the smallness of the story;yes it's about alienation,yes it's clever, yes the sex scene is achingly real and uncomfortable, but this movie has only a few points to make  mostly about alienation and the "otherness" of people  and while it makes them well, they don't amount to a decent movie. Thinking about it afterwards  and puzzled by the praise it has received and disconcerted by my own disappointment  I realised that if this movie has been made with human actors it simply wouldn't get the same sort of critical acclaim, in fact, it would be deemed dull, dull, dull. The thing which lifts it out of the ordinary  but not into the extraordinary  is the fact that it's told via animation. I urge anyone who loves the movie to try and imagine sitting through the same script acted by real people  it would be achingly boring.

Greetings again from the darkness. Seeing Charlie Kaufman's work described as "strange", "weird" or "bizarre" makes me cringe a little because most of his films hit my sweet spot of curiosity, insight and expression. I easily relate to his creative vision and commentary in films like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Synecdoche, New York. His characters are always searching for something and trying to discern the meaning of life  or at least of their own life. This latest has Kaufman adapting his own stage production, and collaborating with co-director Duke Johnson for what is likely (for the vast majority of us) our most startling existential stop-action animated puppet cinematic experience.

The unusual opening of the film is a black screen with only background noise and voices, and the first chuckle occurred within about a minute thanks to one of my favorite cultural references of the year: "Kojak, not Kolchak". Slowly the screen evolves to show clouds in the sky, and soon an airplane appears and our first peek at Michael occurs  he's a passenger on a flight. The vast majority of the rest of the film takes place inside the Fregoli Hotel  aptly named because Michael seems to suffer from a twist on Fregoli Delusion (a person believes those around him are all the same person in disguise).

We soon notice that Michael appears beaten down, even exasperated with life. He is an author in town to give a presentation on his specialty  Customer Service. The story continues along familiar lines of a business traveler in the midst of a mid-life crisis, until things change for him when he stumbles on a couple of his fans who are in town for his presentation. One of them is Lisa, whom Michael is attracted to thanks to her innocent energy and wonderful voice. What makes her voice so wonderful? Well, it turns out that Michael is voiced by British actor David Thewlis, Lisa is voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and EVERY other character in the film (male or female) is voiced by Tom Noonan. Lisa and her voice are the anomaly that makes up the film's title  Michael is smitten with her because her voice is not like all the others - providing a spark of hope.

Mr. Kaufman seems intent on making us realize how easily we can slip into a rut and simply go through the motions in life  every day and every person being pretty much like the rest. Michael has learned to wear his Customer Service mask  one who pretends to care about the issues of others. It's a terrific metaphor for someone refusing to face the responsibility for their own happiness. His awakening occurs at the hands (and in bed) with Lisa. Yes, you should be prepared for the uncommon and slightly unsettling site of Puppet Private Parts. The clumsy passion of the first encounter between Michael and Lisa does wonders for each of them  restoring her self-esteem and awakening him from his daily slumber of hopelessness.

While the story itself is quite simple, the use of puppets prevents us from getting overly personal or judgmental with the characters, and forces us to deal with the emotional and mental aspects of what keeps so many from leading happy lives. Lisa's acapella version of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" ignites the fuse in Michael, and just like that, both he and Lisa are jolted from their own self-imposed limitations. No longer able to just go through the motions, Michael's overreactions at breakfast and during his presentation are all part of his re-awakening  the most profound puppet awakening since Pinocchio. Perhaps Mr. Kaufman thought we might be more receptive to his message and observations if delivered by a non-threatening puppet, and perhaps he's correct. The message is delivered loudly and clearly  though I will probably hear Tom Noonan's voice in my nightmares. The look of the movie and the puppets is fantastic, and Carter Burwell provides yet another spot-on score.

I am a huge Charlie Kaufman fan, and was very excited to get the chance to see this film at the Denver Film Festival this week. However, this film was extremely disappointing. The plot was quite boring and the film really just seemed to be a character study of loneliness and mental health deterioration. It would have made a great short film, but it was entirely too long for such a low-quality plot. The ending left me extremely unsatisfied.

However, I did enjoy the animation, sound, and other technical aspects of the film. But I'd have to rate this 5 stars and place it next to down there next to Schenectady, New York as one of my least favorite Charlie Kaufman films. Apparently I prefer films he writes but does not direct. I'm ready for another Spike Jonze collaboration!

Charlie Kaufmann bores the universe with an even more dull and depressive movie experience than Synecdouche New York, his last super depressing movie. Using animation is interesting for the first few minutes only as any kind of plot development is slower that plate tectonics. As soon as you realize the raison d'etre you save yourself some time by simply watching it fast forward, stopping occasionally to listen to the dull, half wit dialogue, but only long enough to confirm your initial (and correct) decision that there is nothing worth listing to, let alone remembering as worth listening to. Got it? You can save even more time by not watching it. I only wish I had the 14 minutes I spent watching it back, and the 3 minutes I spent on this review. DON'T BOTHER.... <<<<<<------ IN SUMMATION

The latest of Charlie Kaufmann's demonstrations of the effect of point-of-view on story-telling, Anomalisa takes its place in that magnificent line of works beginning with Being John Malkovich, through Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Synecdoche New York, all works of genius.

Taking its cue from a delusional condition, Kaufmann applies the point of view of a sufferer to an otherwise banal midlife crisis and comes up with a remarkable and completely unexpected way of presenting it to us.

Kaufmann is awesome.

As well as the terrific visuals, courtesy of co-director Duke Johnson and his team, there is yet another bullseye from composer Carter Burwell.

The pace of the movie is leisurely. The material feels unusually stretched for a Kaufmann script, which may be because it apparently started out as a 40 minute work. Really, though, it doesn't matter. I'd rather spend a little too long with Anomalisa than five minutes with several other films I could mention. This, after all, is an amazing piece of art.

Rating: 2.5/5 stars

'm a bit mystified by the accolades of "masterpiece" that are being heaped upon "Anomalisa", a stop-motion animation drama co-directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. It's a unique film, no doubt, and one that takes a lot of risks and has a number of scenes that work quite beautifully. It has the mordant, awkward bits of humor and wry observation we have come to expect from Kaufman, but not the insight; it's all surface, which is inadvertently personified by the artifice of the stop-motion animation. The film is supposed to tell us something about human relationships and the conflict between our ideals and our reality, but it's all muddled, which is what makes its near universal praise by critics so bewildering. Kaufman has certainly earned his share of deserved praise for his inimitable, boundary-pushing screenplays for Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation", and Michel Gondry's "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But, he's also hit a few critical bumps along the way, including an earlier collaboration with Gondry, "Human Nature", and his directorial debut, the unmitigated mess "Synecdoche, New York". "Anomalisa", while not quite like the latter, isn't also anywhere near to the quality of the former.

The majority of the film takes place in a nondescript upscale hotel in Cincinnati, where Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis), a published customer service guru on the lecture circuit, has just arrived. Though a conventionally handsome man in his early 50s who is clearly successful professionally and financially, Michael joins the ranks of miserable Kaufman protagonists whose lives are constantly running aground on their own ennui. Potential redemption arrives in the form of Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a conference attendee he meets at the hotel and to whom he is instantly drawn. Severely lacking in self-esteem and poignantly awkward, Lisa is not the conventional object of male desire, but that is precisely what makes her so fascinating (and Michael's attention so surprising to her).

The film is irrefutably a technical marvel, spectacularly illustrating how stop-motion animation can be just as physically and emotionally convincing as any other medium of human expression or technical wizardry. The puppets, which were individually designed and printed using 3D printers, are amazingly lifelike - almost, but not quite, to the point of being uncanny. They stay just this side of the uncanny valley, never venturing toward that precipitous drop- off where animation that is too lifelike becomes weird.

The problems with "Anomalisa" stem from the two main characters, starting with Michael, who is such a miserable, self-absorbed mope that it's virtually impossible to sympathize with him. Michael's physical mundanity belies the intensity of his narcissism, which keeps him from connecting with anyone and ensures that he remains miserable and alone, even when surrounded by others. Early on in the film, we become aware that all the other characters  from a chatty cab driver, to the hotel bellhop, to Michael's wife and son and ex-girlfriend - all have the exact same voice (Tom Noonan's voice, to be exact). It's a clever, albeit potentially confusing, means of conveying the sameness with which Michael views everyone around him, which is heightened by the fact that all the faces on the puppets playing the other characters are oddly similar, as well. The key is the name of the name of hotel where Michael stays: the Hotel Fregoli, a reference to the real- life, but extremely rare Fregoli delusion, a psychological disorder in which a person comes to believe that different people around him are actually the same person in disguise. We aren't meant to think that Michael actually suffers from this disorder (although he says several times that he feels like something is wrong with him psychologically); rather, it plays as a kind of metaphor for Michael's interpersonal isolation, which renders everyone around him a single, undifferentiated mass to whom he cannot connect.

Except Lisa. When he hears Lisa's voice, he recognizes her as fundamentally distinct from all the others and immediately seeks her out. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a fantastic job voicing Lisa, and she makes her the most interesting character on-screen (which she is clearly meant to be - a lovable oddball). But, the film stalls emotionally because there is never any depth or meaning to Michael's intense attraction to her. The film is resolutely concrete in depicting his depressive moroseness, but then it gets all abstract when it comes to his propensity for love, which throws everything off-balance. Thus, even the film's most touching sequence - a rather graphic sex scene that plays fair with the inherent awkwardness of two people who barely know each other suddenly getting intimate - doesn't ultimately work because it has nothing emotional to connect to except an idea. Thus, it works in isolation, but not in concert with the rest of the film.

The fundamental problem with "Anomalisa" is that it's little more than the story of an unsympathetic narcissist assigning his piece of mind to a good-hearted oddball. As a romance, it doesn't work because we just want Lisa to get away from Michael lest he drag her into his sad- sack pit of despair. As an interpersonal cautionary tale it doesn't work because the film's attitude toward Michael is so vague. Had it been more clear about what we were supposed to make of his relationship with Lisa - is it a genuine spark of compatible souls meeting at the wrong time or is Michael just a myopic, misguided jerk with no idea of what he wants - then "Anomalisa" might have registered as something more, even if it were just an indictment of its protagonist. Alas, it ends up as a stew of potentially interesting ideas brought to life with amazing artistry that can't quite hide its hollow core.

This movie had potential. It started out with an interesting premise and a few laughs. the animation was also really beautiful. However, this film had basically no story. A third of its runtime was one long sex scene. The main character had no arc. He was the same person at the end of the film that he was at the start. Typically when you film something with no story and sex it's called porn. The pacing is also terrible and I was bored with this movie from about 10 minutes in. I don't need to see the first world problems of this successful man with mental issues and him preying on a young woman. I haven't even mentioned the continuous unnecessary F-bombs. The only redeeming quality of this film is the talented animation. I only wish the artist didn't have to animate so many penises.

There's no other to say it: 'Anomalisa' is beyond the ordinary, its something like you've never seen before (well, almost). Oscar-Winner Charlie Kaufman Writes & Directs this unusual story, with sensitivity, although the final-act turns up bland. More on that later...

'Anomalisa' Synopis: A man crippled by the Mundanity of his life experiences something out of the ordinary.

'Anomalisa' is a story about a man stuck in monotony & depression. Kaufman along-with Co-Director Duke Johnson, delivers a sad story about facing repetition in life. And they begin the story beautifully & it remains great even after its protagonist forms a relationship with a "different soul". BUT, the final-act is a downer. The narrative falls apart & even though Kaufman's message comes across, it doesn't leave an impact. The open-ending also doesn't work. In short, 'Anomalisa' works wonders, until it falls apart in its penultimate moments.

Kaufman's Writing is truly terrific in the first-hour, but as mentioned prominently before, this story deserved a better end! Kaufman & Duke Johnson's Direction is skilled, as the stop-motion adult animation, is brilliantly done.

David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh & Tom Noonan deliver mesmerizing vocal performances. Leigh, especially, is magnificent. After 'The Hateful Eight', Leigh triumphs once again with a super act in 'Anomalisa'.

On the whole, Despite some faults, 'Anomalisa' deserves a watch for its brave approach & its perfectly done depressing setting.

This film took about an hour to warm up to tepid. I spent the first 30 minutes of the film wondering if it was specifically about the lives of trans-gendered people, all speaking in a male voice. It was a perverted film about a filanderous robot-doll-man and watching him pee, shower, have sex and buy a 'toy' for his 7?yo son at a porn shop. For the FIRST TIME EVER, I really wanted to walk out of the movie 15 minutes in--and regret staying. There was no point to this movie just some rich old white perverted chain-smoking dude hanging out in a hotel room who bangs a young naive lady planning to attend his conference. I wish had left 15 minutes in so I didn't have to witness the rest of it. I didn't even want money back, I'm just sorry I saw the rest of it. They require me to write another line, but I think I wrote enough already, I'm not sure what they want for me to write yet an additional line of text. I told my piece. This is the last line that I will need to author today, thankfully.

This is a film about a middle aged man who looks back on his life and (surprise) has deep regrets and feels empty. He left his girlfriend 10 years ago and the started a new life which is utterly boring and meaningless. Then he returns to the city where he left his real love where he first meets her which doesn't go well and then chats up another woman with whom he has a one night stand. Then next day he has a nervous breakdown at a motivational speech and he returns to his normal boring life and to his safe marriage.

This is well trodden territory and has been dealt many times. The film has nothing do add to it except that there is a long drawn very awkward sex scene which gave the film an R rating. The general theme has been set by the Death of a Salesman many years ago and the feel is pretty much the same. That he is a motivational speaker reminds very much of Up In The Air which has a very similar theme. Again, there the main protagonist gives a speech in front of an audience, fails and it feels strangely familiar. Films such as The Great Beauty are much more inventive and reflect on our times much better. There the protagonist admits it's been empty but it's been fun, for example. Even the flawed Youth with a similar theme deals with middle age, looking back on your life and regret in a much, much deeper way than this very formulaic film.

It's a very generic art-house film about the crisis of a middle aged man. His motivations and what he does are as predictable as it can get.

From one of the opening scenes in a taxi, in which the protagonist is confronted with the mind-numbing, vaguely aggressive stupidity of the taxi-driver's conversation, to the awful, frightening scene in the hotel in which our anti-hero seduces a less than enthusiastic and (again) amazingly stupid young woman, we have an image of all human beings and our culture as utterly debased and meaningless. The film's top-notch animation reproduces lovingly all the details of the emptiness of modern life, from the perfectly formed ice cubes in the hotel ice-maker to the sex toys at the "toy shop" down the street from the hotel. One can read the film as the representation of one man's mental illness (as the name of the Fregoli Hotel, named for a neurological syndrome, invites us to do), but I see this idea as a red herring. This is not about one man's flawed vision -- it is a dark vision of our world the way the filmmakers imagine it, about how all of us are debased cookie- cutter products of a dehumanized culture. The film manages to be thoroughly boring and terrifying at the same time. Incidentally, women in the film are reduced to sex-doll status, which might be one reason why I had a hard time finding a single positive review from a woman on the IMDb site, and why the female viewers who pointed out the scary sexism of the film got shouted down by male fans of animation who identified with the protagonist's unhappiness.

Every time I see a Charlie Kaufman film I'm reminded how fearless he is at examining the human condition and why I need to put a lot of time in between watching his movies.

In "Anomalisa," his Academy-Award nominated animated film, David Thewlis and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh do tremendous voice work as an emotionally ill minor celebrity and the shy, awkward woman with whom he enjoys a one-night stand while at a conference at which he is the speaker. The film is an examination of middle-aged male discontent and loneliness, a subject a younger version of me was always impatient with and which the 41-year-old version of me now finds hits uncomfortably close to home. Kaufman creates a sad character who has many unpleasant tendencies but isn't necessarily a completely unpleasant man, and allows us to see how this one night in the man's life and his approach to human relationships is a stand-in for his entire adult life and the driving force behind his depression.

As in his masterpiece, "Synecdoche, New York," Kaufman refuses to give in to the convention of happy, or at least hopeful, endings, and suggests that it is possible to live an entire life being utterly miserable if you don't possess the resources to do otherwise, a terrifying idea to anyone who has struggled with depression, anxiety, or even just prolonged bouts of general malaise. In so many Hollywood movies about unhappy people, the unhappy people just need the emotional connection to that one special person that shakes them out of their funk and changes everything around for them. One of the things I liked best about "Anomalisa" is its suggestion that, while those special people really do exist, happiness in any one person is something that has to come from inside and isn't going to be imposed on one by another. It isn't comfortable to think about the possibility of life being a long series of missed opportunities, but it feels honest.

I really wanted to like this film. I've seen prior Kaufman films and been very impressed. I love animations. All the media hype about "human" and "touching" and "bittersweet" also drew me in. But OUCH. It's one thing to have a "lost" protagonist that you can "feel for," but lost doesn't even begin to describe Michael Stone. He masquerades as an ordinary middle-aged businessman, perhaps in the throes of a mid-life crisis. Everywhere this guy goes he manages to leave confusion, pain and suffering in his wake, but somehow we, the audience, are supposed to have empathy for his frustration and alienation. There's nothing to like in this guy! And when his softer side emerges through his brief connection with Lisa, it quickly dissolves into his bitter, critical, pathological self. So by the end, there's no epiphany, no resolution, nothing. Lisa is the same sweet, naïve woman (who has presumably taken no lesson from her overnight encounter), and Stone is, well, still a stone. And to those who are reading much more into this tale, including sex dolls and Lisa not being real, etc., I say: you're Emperor's-New-Clothes- ing this film. You REALLY WANT to see something that REALLY ISN'T there. You loved Kaufman's other work, so you decided there must be a lot more here than there is. Color me disappointed. (The two stars are for the animated characters and sets.)

I hated this film from about 10mins in, but i kept watching in vague hope it would improve. Spoiler alert:I was left with so many questions. How long does semen stay gluggy? Did Michael have sex with the automaton Japanese doll? Why would a British guy call his son "slugger"? Which scene was cringier - where they have sex or where Michael has a meltdown while public speaking? (I felt so much cringe at this point i jammed my fingers in my ears to avoid listening). My personal highlight was during the dream sequence when his face fell off. I was hoping he would spend more time with half a face thus sparing us his whiny droning voice. The concept is interesting ie having one male voice for all characters,but early on this left me confused. I thought he was gay when he was reading the first love letter and thought excitedly he might be having a marriage crisis, sadly not. if you haven't seen it yet watch the first ten minutes and only continue if you can bear that whiny Michael stone voice. If it doesn't make you long for a car accident please proceed. If yes,run now and don't look back.

Charlie Kaufman is almost surely on the Mt. Rushmore of full- throttled auteurism. Merely describing the plot of his newest film is enough to give you hint of the mind behind the work; a bizarre examination of the mind-numbingly ordinary.

Just as was the case with fellow auteur Wes Anderson in 2009, when he released the excellent Fantastic Mr. Fox, Kaufman seems to be entering the animation phase of his career. The result Anomalisa, a tale of a man who just doesn't feel right in the world he lives in and one who fights tooth and nail to resist falling into the banality that surrounds him. The man in this story is Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) and we first catch up with him on a plane flying into Cincinnati. It is almost immediately evident that Michael is much like many of the other men we have met throughout Kaufman's filmography; middle-aged, despondent, lonesome and not all that attached to the life his has built for himself. Michael is a kind of self-help, customer service expert coming to Cincinnati to give a speech, yet seems unable to help himself whatsoever.

Kaufman accentuates Michael's existential loneliness by making every character we meet along Michael's trip from the airport to the hotel voiced by the same man, character actor and Kaufman favorite Tom Noonan. Throughout this mundane journey, which takes up much of the first third of the film, we follow Michael as he is forced to make  or rather do his best to not make  small talk with everyone from the oversharing Taxi driver to the polite bell hop.

It is here where one of the themes, intentional or not, of Kaufman's movies begins to rear its head. The main character, usually a male, is almost always this exact blend of relatability and dismissive callousness. Sure some of what the cab driver says is pointless and at times annoying, but Michael isn't exactly a charming and dynamic man himself, yet upon his high horse he sits.

This theme continues as Michael's world expands. From in his ordinary hotel room he makes a series of phone calls, first to his wife and son and then to his old girlfriend whom he left ten years earlier. Both conversations seem to compound rather than alleviate whatever troubles are boiling up within. Despite this he decides to meet up with his former girl in the hotel bar, a scene that goes pretty much how you'd expect, leaving Michael once again alone. It is not until he meets Lisa who is (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the first to cut through the noise and make a visceral impact on Michael's life. The two eventually share a passionate and awkwardly realistic night that promises to break our hero from his perpetual funk.

When I realized that every voice in Anomalisa was a single actor I had, well, one of these moments. I am a fan of Kaufman's work from Synecdoche, NY to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  but he often seems dead-set on walking that thin line between being skillfully clever and a bit arrogant. It wasn't until the moment that Michael and Lisa share the night in the hotel room that I realized the choice of voice actors fell firmly in the former. Lisa's voice represents literally what she means to Michael metaphorically; something new, something different, something to shake him to his core and remove whatever dark cloud has been clearly following him around for years. It is what makes her morning-after transformation, the slow blur of her voice into that of everyone else in this fictional world, all the more heartbreaking. It confirms that the world isn't boring and broken and full of trite copies, but it is Michael who is fractured beyond repair. It is his own outlook, which can no longer see anything unique or beautiful, that is the source for all his despair. On the surface this works. Kaufman once again shows how the inner workings of the mind are often quite different from reality, a worthy topic to be explored. The main issue that once again pervades the film, though, is that I feel like I should be sad for Michael when in reality I am not sure he deserves the beautiful and unique if he can't recognize it all around him. Throughout Anomalisa Michael continuously looks outward to solve his problems, whether it is his wife and son, his old girlfriend or finally, Lisa. He not only hopes they will help him, but seems to think they have a duty to do so. Almost like the fact that everyone is indistinguishable is their own fault rather than his own warped outlook. 

Earlier I compared Kaufman to fellow filmmaker Wes Anderson but that comparison has very little to do with style. Where Anderson can take nearly any subject, from foxes to kids getting kicked out of school, and make them utterly delightful. Kaufman's goal, on the other hand, seems to be to take any subject and make you think and think and probably eventually get a little sad, a goal which, for better or worse, he scores with Anomalisa.

I love the writer Charlie Kaufman, but I'm not as enamored of the director Charlie Kaufman, who indulges his worst tendencies in a way others won't.

Anomalisa starts very slowly, as middle-aged Michael comes into Cincinnati to give a lecture. The movie has a great love for the mundane, so we get a taxi driver giving advice, we get Michael's checking in and ordering dinner, we get an uncomfortable dinner with an ex.

The only notable thing in the early part of this animated drama is that everyone Michael meets is voiced by one actor, both men and women. Only Michael has a unique voice. Then he meets a young, insecure woman who also has a unique voice (wonderfully done by Jennifer Jason Leigh), and this leads to bland conversation and a rather long sex scene.

After all that, I was bored and restless, but then the movie picks up, offering a fascinating scene in the hotel basement after which the movie is weird, funny, sad, and brutally honest.

In both Anomalisa and Synecdoche, Kaufman proves he's comfortable with boring people before getting around to giving Kaufman's fans what they have come to expect from him through movies like BJM and Adaptation. This movie is a slight step up from Synecdoche, but it's still disappointing, although perhaps worth watching anyway.

I cannot emphasize enough how much I hated this film. It was such an interesting concept and the teasers made it look so good that I had to go and see the movie. I didn't see so stupid movie for a long time... S Absolutely awful. I don't know how this movie is so good rated in this page. This movie is a big mess, no story, no logic, nothing. Big waste of 2 hour of my life. I hate this kind of movies. I wonder what is going on in the mind of creators of this movie. A big, analogically constructed mess.this movie is so boring,the main advantage if you want to see this crap i deep sleeping if u wanted that go on.lazy movie. lazy plotting. lazy acting. lazy script. lazy thought

It's been 8 years since Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, Synedoche, New York - that great but under-appreciated little film about a man (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) who dreamed of building a scale model of New York in a warehouse. The critics seemed to like it but didn't voice their approval very loudly, and chances are many won't remember its existence. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign, Kaufman's latest is a stop-motion collaboration with Duke Johnson, an animator probably most famous for his Adult Swim works.

Beginning with mundane chatter in mundane locations, Anomalisa is in no rush to hit you with any visual splendour, which tends to be the norm for animated films. Instead, we follow our miserable protagonist Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a British motivational speaker whose book on customer service is the handbook for those unfortunate enough to be in the business, as he lands in Cincinnati. He grabs a cab ride with an annoying driver who seems to be completely unaware of Michael's depressed, frustrated state, and insists he visit the zoo and tries to Cincinnati's famous chilli. He arrives at his hotel, the Fregoli, where he is unnecessarily escorted to his room by an over-friendly bell boy who informs him of the delights of his standard, mediocre room.

It's probably at this point that you'll realise you haven't been imagining that all the characters look and sound alike, and instead that this is a deliberate tactic key to understanding the mindset of Michael and the themes of the film. The name of the hotel is a clue, as the Fregoli delusion is a condition that causes a person to imagine everyone else to be the same entity in disguise with the sole purpose of inflicting torment on the sufferer. Here, everyone has the face of an adult white male (even the women and children) and has been blessed with the soothing, distinctive voice of Tom Noonan. It is only when Michael stumbles upon two women in his hotel who are there to see his speech the following day that this spell is broken. One of the two women, Lisa, has a barely noticeable facial disfigurement and sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Michael is enamoured.

Michael's relationship with Lisa, who be dubs 'Anomalisa', gives the film a much-needed heart, as this may have otherwise been an exercise in misanthropy. There's no fantasy romance here, but a dinner date where everyone involved drinks too much, Michael's awkward invitation for Lisa to accompany him back to his room, and a sex scene which is, ironically, the most realistic I've ever seen on film. Michael accidentally rolls onto her hair, she bangs her head, he asks her the awkward question of whether she's cool with oral sex - there's certainly no pan to a roaring fireplace,

You would think that the heightened sense of realism would make the choice to film this in stop-motion slightly redundant, but oddly, it makes the film even more human. It also allows Kaufman and Johnson to show much more of life's ugliness - we are treated to Michael's middle-aged stark naked body jumping out of the shower and the sight of a random man across the way getting ready to masturbate in front of his computer. It's often difficult to sit through. I work in customer services myself and can empathise with Michael's internal struggle of feeling trapped within himself and that others are barely distinguishable from one another. Don't expect any tidy resolutions either, Kaufman is intelligent enough to realise that the excitement of meeting an interesting girl is only temporary, and life will still go on. It's upsetting, certainly, but Anomalisa offers a real insight into the human soul and makes a lasting impression.

Firstly, the animation is excellent and conveys the ideas of the film very well. However, the problem with a film conveying a life that is empty, tedious and annoying is that the film can become empty, tedious and annoying, which is the case here. Another problem is that we are meant to sympathise with the main protagonist, who is unrelentingly dull, self- absorbed and dismissive of everyone else. Personally I felt like kicking him not sympathising with him. 

This could have been mitigated by humour. There was a good joke in the the first two minutes. Unfortunately that was the only joke.

In truth I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. If I got the chance to live my life again one of the things I would make a point of doing the second time around would be to not see this film.

This movie is animated pornography. I think the high rating was strictly for the creativity and nothing else. The ending was depressing and had no redeeming quality. Pure trash. If you love watching adultery and marital unfaithfulness as if it is normal behavior, then you'd like this movie. If you like seeing the moral gutter, you'll think this movie is watchable. I only wish the advertisements had warned me of it, I would have stayed away. I was waiting for the story line to get better, but instead it got worse until the ending was the worst of all, and left me depressed and wishing I had never seen it. Psychological vomit.

I'm not a dedicated Kaufman fan, but I have enjoyed his other films. This movie has Kaufman all over it... dripping in his artist style. I gave it an 8 not because I liked it, but because I sat for 20 minutes pondering how much I thought Michael Stone, and perhaps Charlie Kaufman himself, is an utter a**wipe. 

And after thinking about it, I realized that it is an artistic work. I appreciate art, even if it leaves a strange and bitter taste in my mouth. I think the average viewer will not like it, they will probably be cursing after and wondering why they spent their money to see it, or why they willed themselves to sit though it...or why they didn't leave sooner. 

I get the film, and of all the bits that were super weird, the best part was Michael's breakdown when he was giving his speech. I love the reference to the corruption of the Bush administration, and I love how it brilliantly captured a moment I personally wish would happen; a person on stage breaking a barrier of civility and letting their frustration out. You know, expressing their loneliness and pain, albeit in a really awkward way. 

I can imagine most female viewers to be pretty upset at the slightly manipulative aspect of Michael and Lisa's affair, it's what appalled me most. This film is told from a very male perspective, so I can understand why Michael acts the way he does. It really shows the fragility of some men, and the lows they go to. I don't know, is that normal to treat a woman like that?! I happen to have the utmost respect for women and find it very selfish of Michael to pursue Lisa. It seems out of his extreme loneliness he was able to focus on her and find something beautiful about her. Only to turn it around and distort it, making her into an ideological savior. He wakes up the next morning to realize she really isn't that different and unique as he thought...she is kind of just like the others. Conversely, through Lisa's loneliness she willingly and naively accepts Michael's actions as normal...and that scene at the end where she is happily writing that letter to him, WTF!? And then it makes me think, maybe Michael and Lisa really are meant for each other, and Michael was too scared to truly change his life. 

But perhaps that's the point of this film, to be a little disgusted I mean. The entire qualification for a good work of art is to convey and transmit some sort of truth. Not all truths are beautiful and uplifting. This story is very true to many people's lives, especially of American life. Loneliness and that feeling that so many people are just replicas of a copy. Mindlessly living life...

Did I enjoy this film, no. Will I watch it again, perhaps not for another 10 years. Can I respect what it was aiming to achieve, yes.

I should start by saying that I'm not a big Charlie Kaufman fan. But I liked this movie. Can't say I really understood everything that he meant to do with this movie (while others on IMDb say it's actually a simple idea that was stretched for 80 min). I waited for a reveal or something, which didn't really come, but all in all I enjoyed this movie.

While watching the movie I couldn't understand why his ex-g/f has a male voice: first I thought it was a man and that Michael is homosexual, then when she arrived at the hotel I thought perhaps it's supposed to be a transgender, then I looked up IMDb to see who's voicing the ex-g/f and noticed that list of cast is extremely short, so I closed it right away before reading - I realized there's something going on there. But it was very confusing to watch.

Interesting animation, good atmosphere - and Jennifer Jason Leigh is always a pleasure. Be warned, this is a slow-paced movie and although made in stop motion animation, it's definitely for adults only.
