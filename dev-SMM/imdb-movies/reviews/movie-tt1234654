### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
... (which, if you've read the other reviews here, you know is a massive understatement).

Let's start with the two obvious stumbling blocks to loving this rather astonishingly good and (for some) altogether life-affirming and lovable movie.

-- The main character is pretty much a jerk.

-- There's no plot.

Now, realize: the main character is *supposed* to be unlikeable. And the movie does not try to have a plot. And you might wonder, how can a movie that starts with these two conditions possibly be any good, let alone some be some kind of masterpiece? So let me explain.

Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller in the performance of his life) is by no means completely unlikeable. He's quite funny, an adept verbal wit (there is no situational comedy in this movie at all; it's funny in places because Greenberg is often funny). He has very firm and uncompromising moral ideals. He cares deeply and responsibly for animals. What makes him unlikeable is that he sometimes, unexpectedly, treats people, especially people he cares for, like crap -- he uses that verbal wit like a blunt knife and goes on unwarranted tirades. And he has almost no insight into himself (occasionally the movie is very funny at his expense.) You know that guy in your family who is fundamentally, deep down, a very good person, but is all too often an incredible pain and aggravation to be with? That's Greenberg. He is, in short, the sort of person who is much easier to love than to like. 

We are told from the outset that he has, in fact, just been released from a mental institution, and this is one of the least clichéd and most fully-rounded portraits of a seriously mentally ill person in recent cinema. We watch as he works really, really hard to sabotage any hope he has for a happy life.

He meets and is immediately smitten with a woman (played terrifically by Greta Gerwig; it's nearly as much her story as his) who has her own set of neuroses, but ones that are much more ordinary than his. We watch their relationship play out over a few months exactly as it might in real life, without any set of causally related events to provide an engine of plot.

So what narrative tension is there? Why keep watching? Very simply, if you like Roger Greenberg enough to have empathy and sympathy for his plight, if you can see past the sarcastic surface to the deep pain underneath, if you can recognize a little bit of yourself in him, then you are going to root for him to get his act together, to cut all that nonsense out, to start to understand himself --in short, to start to recover some sanity, to find the first cobblestones of the path to some kind of happiness.

Well, that's what happens, and it's wonderful to watch. (That it's possible to watch the movie and not notice it happening is obvious from some of the reviews here, including one that criticized the ending as incomplete; in fact, this may have the best and most perfect last line of any movie I can think of.)

If you didn't much like _Sideways_ or _Up in the Air_, I can guarantee that you will hate _Greenberg_ (I mean, imagine those movies, but with no plot, too!). If you loved those movies -- if you have no problem watching emotionally stunted people slowly grow up -- then you'll probably love this, too, and you may even love the way that the lack of conventional plot makes the movie completely realistic and hence especially powerful emotionally. When I first wrote this review, I ended by saying "I can't wait to see it again and I suspect I'll watch it many times." I've now seen it twice more and, indeed, it only gets better.

This film was slightly misadvertised. It is not a "funny movie," it is a pseudo-slice of life movie with an eccentric but believable character. It is a comedy in the sense that it is not a tragedy.

I enjoyed this film immensely. I found it very cathartic and realistic. It is "funny" in the sense that Ben Stiller is socially inappropriate at times, but honestly, it's not a "funny" film, and sometimes the film tries to be funny and definitely falls flat. The story is also a little slow to start. That said, it's still a good film.

Some people clearly don't "get" this film...Anyone who says "it wasn't funny!!" or "nothing happened!" is missing the point. This is one of those rare movies based entirely on character, with a very realistic plot progression. It's not the best movie of the year or anything, but it's a really good example of a character-driven story. If you don't care about or "get" Greenberg, there is nothing for you here.

I must protest the people who say the film is unbelievable. It *is* very believable, but not necessarily relatable. It portrays a man bordering on mental instability *very* well.

Ultimately, this movie is similar to Woody Allen pics in affect, although much less "funny." But it still has that "world through the eyes of a neurotic" gimmick, as well as the laissez-faire plot progression.

Ben Stiller also deserves praise for a great, "real" performance as Greenberg, and he is supported by a mixed cast (some great, some poor).

I recommend this film to anyone familiar with OCD, anxiety, or anyone over 40 who asks "what happened?"

Greenberg, about a discontented 40 year old who's not at all sure what he's doing with his life, is a provocative slice of life - but it's not for all tastes. It moves slowly and demands extra attention, but even if you're really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went.

Ben Stiller, in a terrific performance, is the titular ne'er do well, an itinerant carpenter housesitting for his brother in Los Angeles for six weeks. During that time, be meets and falls in and out of like for his brother's executive assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig, who's also magnificent), who's just as awkward as Roger Greenberg.

The bulk of the film covers their relationship on one track and the events of Greenberg's past that have led to his existential where-am-I ponderances. Some 15 years earlier, Roger was in a band out of college with a few good friends. They were apparently quite good, but when a record company offered them a deal, Roger turned it down, afraid of the success it might bring. This led to a serious rift in the band, causing each member to go his separate way; none of the members has played much music in the intervening years.

Liking Roger isn't easy for anyone, not even the audience. He's sort of a jerk. (It's mentioned that he's just been released from a mental institution, although the cause for his hospitalization is not explained.) The film indicates that Roger has problems maintaining relationships, sometimes acting out - and lashing out - in order to keep himself safe and serene. His arrival in LA allows him to reconnect with several of his old friends, many of whom he hasn't seen in those 15 years.

It's these fractured relationships that hold the key to Greenberg's life. At times, he tries to patch things up and move on with his life, but he's just as likely to snap at the friend or lapse into the same behavioral issues that had plagued him as a young man.

Stiller is really, really good in this. He's surprisingly very good at showing myriad emotions convincingly. At once, you believe Greenberg is a polarizing, hurting, hurtful man on the cusp of the rest of his life. Stiller's brand of comedy can take time to grow on someone, but he really shows his range here. I certainly didn't know he could plumb the depths of a character like he did to Roger Greenberg.

Gerwig is his equal and is a real presence here. Florence is - like her namesake Nightingale - a huge help to Greenberg's brother as his assistant, and he's much more savvy about taking care of the house than Greenberg is about taking care of himself (in a funny early scene, she asks him to make a list of things for her to get at the store, and he writes "whiskey" and "sandwiches"). But as good as she is at her professional life, her personal life is an absolute mess. She goes on one-night stands because they feel good - okay, no problem there - but she has few true connections in life. She has one good friend, and you get the impression that her family isn't really close to her (she says her niece doesn't relate too well to her). Florence is physically and emotionally awkward, unsure of herself in all ways save for her job, in which she's commanding. This, of course, also makes her terribly vulnerable to the advances of the older Greenberg.

So the acting is really top notch, but the movie just isn't for everyone. Here's why. There's a lot of plot, a lot of things happening, but very little is resolved or accomplished; the film almost feels like a stream of consciousness to which we're privy. What WILL Greenberg do after the six weeks are up? Will he stay with Florence? Will he jilt her? In the end, does it really matter? Probably not; the ending is abrupt, although not out of place for the rest of the film. But one really needs to be atuned to Greenberg's plight in order to enjoy the film. If one isn't, the movie's mostly dull with bits of funny moments interspersed throughout. I didn't find it terribly heartwarming, just a character study of an unlikable character. Which is not a bad thing at all, but this one just didn't completely work for me.

Greetings again from the darkness. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed the excellent "The Squid and the Whale", and it is with "Greenberg" that he really makes a statement as an independent filmmaker to anticipate. The second gem is always the most elusive. That said, I am not sure I can recommend this movie to very many people, despite all the good things I am about to write.

This is the first Ben Stiller role that actually seems to fit him. His typical role is as a punchline. Here, he plays a guy who recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now house-sitting for his rich brother, whose family is vacationing in Vietnam. Throughout the movie, Greenberg states he is concentrating on doing "nothing" right now. Of course, that is his defense mechanism for being unable to connect or communicate with any real person. Yes, that sounds bleak ... and it is. Yet, it is also fascinating and thought-provoking.

Despite Stiller's strong turn, Greta Gerwig (as Florence) proves to be the heart of the story. She is the family assistant to Greenberg's brother and finds herself oddly attracted to Greenberg's vulnerable state. This is my first exposure to Ms. Gerwig and I find her fascinating as an actress. She has a natural openness on screen and is certainly no glamour-gal. Instead she comes across as a very real 25 year old trying to make sense of life - especially her own.

In addition to Ms. Gerwig, Rhys Ifans provides outstanding support work as Greenberg's long ago band mate. This is the polar opposite of Ifan's character in "The Boat that Rocked" as here is just a guy putting together a grown up life for himself. He struggles with the adjustment, but accurately depicts how choices can make or break us.

I am not sure whether to categorize this as a character study or just an exquisitely written series of scenes that hit the nail on the head. One of the best scenes of the film is when Stiller meets up with Jennifer Jason Leigh and she immediately rebuffs his reconciliation attempts. They had been a couple briefly 15 years ago and she has obviously moved on. Excellent film-making.

The best way I can describe Greenberg the character is that he is a compilation of the dark thought that we all experience from time to time ... a desire to do nothing, wanting to be blunt and direct, dreams of recapturing the magic of youth, and of course, writing complaint letters for everything wrong in the world. Obviously, most of us spend very little real time on these things, but that is the Greenberg character. Let's keep an eye on Mr. Baumbach - he may just be the real deal.

You know those fleeting, inelegant moments and transitory, almost Seinfeldian scenarios in our lives that, unlike on Seinfeld, we never really talk about, because they betray how clueless and insecure we all are? You know how we'll go to parties basically to see one person and find we're inept at opening up and socializing with anyone else? You know those pointless, roundabout stories we'll tell about something that happened that we thought was interesting or funny but we don't realize how boring or monotonous they are till we're halfway through them? What about the receiving end of that situation? Why are we so worried about hurting these painful storytellers' feelings when they're making us so uncomfortable having to feign interest or amusement for indefinite durations? You know those sexual experiences we never talk about even to our best friends because they were so painfully awkward and nakedly ungraceful? You know how when we're on drugs we only indulge occasionally and we find ourselves wording things in creative ways, feeling overconfident and impulsive while everyone else is viewing us as rather reckless? Roger and Florence know, all too painfully, awkwardly, uncomfortably, recklessly well.

Some of us handle these situations much better than others. Some of us save face, some of us don't care that much, some of us read other people well enough to know it's all just part of life. Forty-year-old carpenter Roger Greenberg and his brother's college-age assistant Florence are stranded by an utter deficiency of any of these possible salvages. Inevitably finding themselves sharing these horrible moments whenever they're together, they are in turn repulsed by one another. They can't stop reeling over what happened last night, the other night, a week ago. And while Florence is too timidly self-effacing and in need of being with someone to bring herself to write off Roger, Roger's whole perspective on everything is disfigured by his narcissistic compulsion toward suffering, his hermit-like disdain for any and every inconvenience, and righteous indignation that he can't allow to exist alongside ever being at fault. It's Seinfeld in the bathroom with a razor blade in the tendon.

When you watch the trailer, you're watching a nervously smoking exec hoping to at least break even by streamlining all the overtly laugh-inducing moments. With the possible exception of less than a handful, they indeed are all in the preview. The dry carping lines by Stiller, the Starbucks letter, at the party telling off the Gen-Y stoners, hitting the SUV and bailing when it actually stops. Greenberg is a comedy, but in such an internal and carefully cringe-worthy way that most scenes are seemingly shapeless renderings of a combination of characters situated in a combination of day-to-day situations and the readily apparent punchline moments are indeed that few and that far between. But that is its intent, and it succeeds with witty effect: An impossible jerk and a bashful, marginally popular girl idiosyncratically push each other's most debilitatingly precarious buttons but aren't able to go their separate ways because they're too thin-skinned to be alone. It is the ultimate anti-romantic comedy. No Golden Globe moments here.

Ben Stiller gives the performance I believe all truly good comic actors capable of, one of fierce angst and biting personal honesty. We've seen Sandler unravel an entirely different dimension of himself in Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me, Robin Williams in World's Greatest Dad and Insomnia, Pryor in Blue Collar, and so on. Roger Greenberg is his tour de force as a well-rounded, perceptive and talented actor who's not afraid of his audience going as far as to dislike his character, which would be entirely understandable for many viewers to feel, because he deeply understands Greenberg and doesn't judge him. The gratifying discovery we make here is that of Greta Gerwig. Yes, she is very sexy, but exactly the way Greenberg describes, "She's, I don't know, bigger. I find it sexy." She's pure salt of the earth, a real person unfettered by make-up or fashion. I know many girls who talk, dress and act just like her Florence, who she makes come alive on just the right naturalistic levels.

Writer-director Noah Baumbach made two previous films very strongly akin to this. They were the concise and beautiful The Squid and the Whale and the soul-crushingly relatable and mercilessly matter-of-fact Margot at the Wedding. All three of these films have difficult and self-unaware individuals at their centers, they each share a bone-dry and woefully cynical sense of humor and they each reveal Baumbach's inimitable talent at showing us characters and situations so universal and everyday as to level-headedly gaze at the most abstract innards of acknowledgeable moments of personal and social frustration. His actors always feel extemporaneous, in the moment, unscripted. Their characters belong to an ever-pervading yet little-characterized contemporary facet of liberalized information-age American society. At arm's length he shares the quirky, idiosyncratic likes of Wes Anderson, except there is not one shred of hopeful sweetness or heart-warming serendipity. Those are things we love, and we embrace them whenever we experience them, but at the expense of never taking the time to face the realities of the banal, the bilious stuff of everyday life. That's where Baumbach comes in.

I just spent a couple hours struggling through this cinema of confusion. I kept waiting for the film to get better but alas.... it never did. Stiller plays a confused, disillusioned human being and that's exactly what overwhelms this film. It's depressing, distressing, and grievous to watch minute after minute of pointlessness. Do women actually give themselves up to complete strangers without protest? I certainly hope not... and I especially hope they don't give themselves up to the likes of Ben Stiller's character. Stiller's character continually abuses everything that walks on two legs... I can't imagine that anyone would maintain a friendship of any sorts with such a knob. Please... do yourself a favor and spend an evening donating blood or volunteering to be a human canon ball before you waste any time watching this garbage... terrible. Absolutely terrible...

"A shrink said to me once that I have trouble living in the present, so I linger on the past because I felt like I never really lived it in the first place, you know?"

Greenberg is a drama about...Greenberg. Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller), to be specific. A 40 year-old New Yorker who returns to Los Angeles to stay at his successful brother's home while he and his family are away on a trip. He's not dealing with his life not going the way he planned as well as most of the other people he knows, and he's perpetually stuck in the past. The music he listens to is old, he talks to people about events that happened 15 years ago that they don't even remember, and he's just generally an unhappy guy. His main activity is writing letters of complaint to various companies.  

To say that Roger is flawed is an understatement. He just got out of a mental hospital recently, he's self-centered, and he tends to freak out about insignificant things as a way to protect himself from people and the world. Yet, I still liked him. As does Florence, (Greta Getwig) his brother's personal assistant who isn't exactly a model of happiness and mental health, herself, and Ivan (Rhys Ifans), Roger's long-suffering old friend and band mate, who is having family troubles of his own. 

If I had to compare this to another movie, it would be Rachel Getting Married. Not because of any plot similarities, but because of a similar tone and some shared themes. Specifically, being adrift in adult life and how issues and regretted decisions from youth can linger and fester. Also similar to Rachel Getting Married, there's never a breakthrough moment where the flawed characters are suddenly okay, and all the problems disappear.  If you expect grand resolutions from your movies, please avoid Greenberg. All we get is a sliver of light at the end that makes us think that something positive may be happening in some of these characters' lives. We're left to imagine and hope that Roger, Florence, and Ivan are on the road to getting (or finding out) what they need from life.  

So yeah, I liked it. It's a good "indie" drama, and quite different from Stiller's usual thing. Stiller and Gerwig were both great, the characters were well-written, and I've always been interested in these kinds of stories about adults flailing away blindly in this tricky thing we call life. If you're a fan of movies like Margot at the Wedding, The Squid and the Whale (both movies share Greenberg's director), and Rachel Getting Married, I'd suggest that you give this a try.

Greenberg is one of those films where you have to say wow, the performance are Oscar worthy, but trying to get through it, you say, oh will it ever end, puleeeese. I wish I could end my review right there, because that says it all, but IMDb requires a certain amount of lines. This is Ben Stiller's chance at Punch Drunk Love but unfortunately it is just a jumbled mess. Oh, how many times while I watched this movie did I moan, oh, please, just be over already, this is so boring. The plot goes nowhere. This would be cool if it was actually a comedy as advertised but it is not a comedy at all, not a single laugh, not even an attempt at a laugh, it is a drama. A drama needs to go somewhere. The Graduate went somewhere. This movie is just almost two hours of two emotionally imbalanced people interacting to no end. Who cares??? Wasted performances. Wasted talent. Two hours of character study of unlikeable characters. Why???

I was under the impression that this would be another wacky Ben Stiller comedy. When I started watching it and learned that Noah Baumbach (who had previously made the excellent 'Margot at the Wedding') was the director, I knew this was going to be a different kind of movie that would probably reveal a different side of Ben Stiller's acting. Many have described this to be for Stiller what 'Punch Drunk Love' was for Adam Sandler and 'Stranger Than Fiction' was for Will Ferrell.

Baumbach's 'Greenberg' is a character driven piece that centres on Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller), who recently left a mental asylum and is back in town to housesit for his brother who's away on holiday. He falls for his brother's assistant and tries to pick up the pieces of a life he had once left behind while going through a midlife crisis.

Like he did with 'Margot at the Wedding', Baumbach's execution is lowkey and his narration mostly relies on the interactions between the characters and the protagonist's quiet moments when he/she is alone. The art direction is suitably minimal and the camera-work is solid. The dry humour is very effective and consistent with the atmosphere Baumbach creates.

Ben Stiller does a remarkable job with an effortless performance. This is definitely a departure from what he's familiar with and he proves that he can deliver a restrained performance when required. Rhys Ifans is equally good. Jennifer Jason Leigh (who also co-wrote the screenplay) provides fine support on both counts. Greta Gerwig is competent.

Baumbach has done it again, successfully telling a complex story that appears to be much more than what shows on the surface.

***Spoiler Warning***

This is one of the dumbest films I've seen in a while. Is watching a mentally ill person's missteps supposed to be funny? I want the 107 minutes of my life back. From the beginning of the film, I was wondering "Who are all these people? Do I care?". This POS just goes downhill from there. 

Ben Stiller's character is obviously mentally ill, so we give his dumb ass behavior a pass. Are his complaining letters supposed to be funny? Writing American Airlines because the buttons on the seats weren't right? Just OCD. What's funny about that?

Greta Gerwig's Florence is really nice, and she has a warm personality in spite of the fact that apparently she was never fond of her father. Why is she the least bit interested in Greenberg? My guess is it's the same type of thing when you're driving down the highway and you see a nasty, ugly wreck. You can't help but stare at it right? Rubbernecker syndrome.

Nasty ugly wreck pretty much sums up this "film." 2 out of 10 is generous.

I stumbled upon this gem of a movie last night, and today I am grateful that I did.

Roger Greenberg is a lost man. He might have been a major rock musician, but that went nowhere, thanks to his own hubris. He might have been a successful carpenter, but he is now relegated to building his brother a dog house. He might have had long-standing girlfriend, but he managed to sabotage that, too. Time and again, Roger has been his own worst enemy, turning opportunity after opportunity into remorse. And after he leaves a mental hospital, Greenberg remains checked out. All he plans to do is "nothing." In her own way, Florence is broken, too. So desperate to have intimacy, she trades sex for the hope that a one-night encounter will develop into something more. And while the film doesn't explicitly say so, I got the impression that she did so, again and again, never achieving the elusive closeness she wanted so much.

You might think these two would be a disaster for each other, and you're right. Except that they're not. Somehow, they navigate both of their self-defeating behavior to find a chance at something real with each other. And it's how they get there that is the magic of this film.

Strip away notions of happy-go-lucky romance or wacky comedy, because you won't find those here. The most satisfying moments of "Greenberg" come as you recognize a bit of yourself in these fractured people. Who hasn't agonized over what might have been decades after a golden opportunity got away? Who hasn't been so desperate for a connection with the right person - whoever that might be - that we make do with whoever might be at hand? And then you realize that in our brokenness, we are all of us united. "There's a crack in everything; that's how the light gets in," as Leonard Cohen would say.

I was first shocked to hear the strong negative reactions some had to this movie, but then I got it. "Greenberg" is a movie for people who know what it is like to feel lost, but maybe some people never do. My hat's off to them if that's the case. For the rest of us, I suspect, "Greenberg" rings true.

Like they say, you can spot a cockerel from the moment it is hatched, you can actually tell a great movie in the first ten minutes most of the time. Occasionally a movie comes along that builds slowly to a great climax at the very end. That is the hope that kept me through this excruciatingly boring attempt at film-making. I mean, who can tell me the point of this movie? Not once in the entire movie did anything so much as evoked a smile on my face yet they billed it as a comedy.

The title character is supposed to be suffering from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder but apparently no one taught the actor what a patient with OCD should look like. Hasn't the actor watched the title character in The Aviator? There is a flicker of ramance in the movie but in the end you wonder if Roger loves Florence or he is just feeling sorry for her. The part of the movie that featured an unplanned pregnancy and an abortion is so emotionally dry you could swear some other couple are involved not them. We are not even told who is the father of the baby but we can infer that it is Roger because Florence denied sleeping with the other guy. In spite of this, you do not see any emotions displayed by Roger or Florence before or after the abortion - this is so unreal for those who have actually been through this experience in real life.

Another totally incongruous piece in this movie is the caligraphy hanging on the wall of the home Roger was staying in. We are made to believe that this is a Jewish home yet the caligraphy is the Arabic script that translates to "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful and the Most Beneficient". Well, if this was meant to be a subliminal message that is supposed to show that Jews and Arabs have a common ground, no mention of Islam or the presentation of an Arab character featured in this totally pointless movie.

In the end, the climax that I anticipated to give this movie a reason for being never materialized. I was left wondering what was it all about. This is clearly the kind of movie you should be watching in a blizzard when you are sure there are no taxis available and your home is far away.

Greenberg might have been a different film in the hands of someone like Woody Allen, or Argentine director, Eliseo Subiela (Man Facing South East)who understand where and why illness/neurosis resonate with an audience. Director/writer, Noah Baumbach, thinks telling us about those things in Greenberg is the entertainment. Well, it ain't.

I'm a huge Ben Stiller fan. Around the water-cooler, I still talk about scenes from Dodgeball, Tropic Thunder and Meet the Parents. Iconic moments of comedy. Just typing the title for this movie, Greenberg, and my upper lip is curling into a sneer.

So, Ben, you play a 40 something ex-band member, recently released from a psychiatric hospital, trying to get on with his life. We watch you fringe-dwell, make non committal choices. You moan, complain. You treat those who might care for you, with indifference. With those who have cared for you, you simper, behave obsequiously. Sure, why not? It makes sense. You're a recent mental patient. What doesn't make sense is, WHY THE *SAM HILL* YOU MADE THIS MOVIE?

It's not funny, nor is its subject matter executed in an insightful or entertaining way. It does bring new meaning to the word MUNDANE. The two lead characters are, on the whole, uninteresting, bored, or boring. When writer/director Noah Baumbach delves into the detail of their lives, it's even more uninteresting, boring and mundane. These are people who we know exist in the sub-zones of our society, but we don't seek them, or their neurosis, out for our entertainment. Ben, I can only think you owed Noah a big favor by playing in Greenberg. When you choose your next foray into drama, do it for the right reasons.

Just as he's turning forty, Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) finds himself with no real friends, no significant other, and no actual purpose in life. He's also just been released from a mental institution, so you can well imagine that his neuroses are going to be pretty much off the chart as well. A carpenter and former musician who regularly resides in New York City, Greenberg is currently house-sitting at the Hollywood Hills home of his wealthy and successful brother, Phillip (Chris Messina), while the latter is away on business in Vietnam with his family. While he's staying there, Greenberg meets Florence (Greta Gerwig), a sweet but rather unfocused woman almost half his age, who works as a personal assistant  i.e. dog walker, babysitter and all-around gopher - to Phillip and his family. 

Greenberg's mental issues manifest themselves through various phobias and idiosyncrasies, all of which lead us to the conclusion that he is generally just afraid of life, of taking a risk when doing so could possibly lead to failure. To that end, he avoids large groups of people, writes endless letters of complaints to companies he feels have somehow screwed him over, overreacts to other people's words and actions, and makes a general antisocial and sociopathic pain-in-the-ass of himself. And to no one is he more psychologically abusive than to Florence, a girl with her own share of vulnerabilities, who in his own crazy way he is obviously trying to impress but who he just keeps pushing away with his eccentric behavior. 

It's hard to really get much of a bead on either Greenberg or Florence, and that is both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the screenplay by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Noah Baumbach, who also directed the film. On the one hand, one appreciates the complexity of the characters, their refusal to allow themselves to be pigeon-holed into one neatly delineated box or other. On the other, the coolly objective stance the script takes creates a barrier between us and the characters, the result being that we find it hard to identify or empathize much with them, especially Greenberg, who finally becomes as off-putting to us as he is to those he comes in contact with throughout the course of the picture. In drama, there's a fine line between a character who is intriguingly different and one who is just annoyingly self-indulgent, and "Greenberg" crosses over that line with dismaying regularity.

Still, the performances are excellent  this is probably Stiller's best dramatic work to date  and the inconclusive ending is impressively brave enough to erase a multitude of earlier sins.

There is a man, Roger Greenberg (Stiller), around 40, who is house-sitting for his brother who took his family on a vacation. We have heard Roger was in a mental hospital and now seemingly okay, goes about his business being demanding, uncaring, selfish, mostly oblivious to other peoples' needs/feelings but also in a funny way, trying to reestablish himself. But, he is no hurry to do that. Told you it was in a funny way. 

Remember the Seinfeld TV show where it was practically about nothing, yet you laughed your head off? This movie, too, is about nothing yet we are kept waiting for 90-minutes for it to start. There is basically no story. This is a slice of life that goes nowhere. And, there is more tension in here than in some murder mystery/thriller because we have no idea what Greenberg will do or say next.

For the most part he does nothing, which really doesn't add up as someone trying to reestablish himself toward any goal, job or future. So the way I see it, this falls flat. Not even any good lines to come away with. None funny anyway except for the Stiller in-crowd. Greenberg is just self centered and that is that. 

Wait. There was one good line in here: hurt people hurt people. That sums up Greenberg and this movie. Greenberg realized he did hurt people, but saying that and doing something about it are two different things. Some may argue he started to do something at the end of the movie. Are we so sure of that? 

We are not sure why his friends are still his friends as Greenberg in his younger days put the Kabosh on a record deal that would have made his musical group rich and famous, but they broke up and went their separate ways. 

I thought that the letter writing campaign to companies that displeased him because of poor service (in his mind) would be the comic relief in here. Didn't happen. Ben should talk to his father Jerry about comedy. Look, if you are not going to do comedy, then confrontations are needed and the only one was with Ivan near the end of the movie. Not enough. 

I did come away with something though. Rhys Ifans who played Greenberg's best friend Ivan has a lot of Peter O'Toole in him. I wouldn't say as animated as O'Toole in his later years but there's something there. I suppose we will know more when Ivans stars in a remake of Lawrence of Arabia.

Violence: No. Sex: Yes, twice Nudity: Yes, once Language: Yes, some in the beginning.

Ben Stiller isn't funny when he tries too hard, nor can he be emotionally effective playing an unlikable bum. There I said it! Stiller stars in "Greenberg". He plays the title character named Roger, a washed-up failed musician who watches over his jerk of a brother's house while his brother is on vacation in Vietnam. Greenebrg is so unlikable it's impossible to root for him. It doesn't help that Stiller does "look at me acting" work. The writers don't do a clever job by making it a challenge to like the lead. All they do is butcher the story, making it an absolute mess of simple- shot filmmaking. Stiller falls for his brothers maid played by Greta Gerwig, the most unlikable actress who is so irritating and stupid that I prayed for the worst possible outcome for her pathetic character. "Greenberg" is full of awkwardness. From it's surprising strong, uncomfortable sex scenes to Greenebrg's socially challenged behavior, director Noah Baumbach proves he had no idea what he we was doing with this worthless script. Not only is this film glacially slow, containing a tedious male lead, has no back story, and too long, but it fails at making a story about relationships. The routine relationships in Roger's life are so weak. The black- comedy doesn't work here. All it feels like is thrown out ideas on a script a wanna be writer would create. The story is progressive and never felt like the story was leading towards any big climax or conclusion. "Greenberg" is one of the most terrible movie-going experiences of my life.

Noah Baumbach, director of "The Squid and the Whale", directs "Greenberg". Another black comedy, the film stars Ben Stiller as Greenberg, a dysfunctional carpenter who returns to his hometown after what seems like a lifetime of disappointment. Along the way he strikes up a relationship with a young woman played by Greta Gerwig, the quirky starlet of US independent cinema.

Every year another indie flick about a depressed old guy (or teenager) who heals himself via sex with an enchanting young woman is released. "Greenberg" initially adheres to this formula, but quickly branches off into new territory. In Baumbach's hands, Greenberg's forever troubled by the disparity between what he is and what he hoped to be at his age. Mirrored to Greenberg's late-life crisis is Gerwig's quarter-life crisis, in which she bounces from one failed relationship to the next whilst dutifully tending to other people's problems. During the film's best sequence, when Greenberg gets high at a party, he then voices his opinions about today's generation of kids. Kids are more self-assured, connected, confident, toughly cynical, realistic, less idealistic and stronger via their inculcated stupidity, he says, oblivious to the fact that the film's Gerwig subplot invalidates everything he says. Things are the same, just faster, harder, quicker and more ruthless. Midlife crises become teenage crises, and today the burnouts come sooner rather than later.

Unusual for such films, "Greenberg's" sex scenes are awkward and lead to no closure, conciliation or triumph. Indeed, their counterpointed with depressing abortions. Elsewhere "Greenberg" seems preoccupied with questions of ethics, Stiller's character refusing to taint an arts career in favour for easy cash. This, he thinks, makes him decidedly different from today's generation, who seem to have no values and so less obstacles. Again, Gerwig's plight proves him wrong. There are sensitive, pained souls on either side of the generation gap.

"Greenberg" sports an unusual aesthetic, part mumblecore, part indie textbook, part glossy Ben Stiller flick. Actor Rhys Ifans co-stars as Greenberg's old buddy Ivan, another shabby guy who must come to terms with truncated aspirations.

7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

I am certainly what you would call an amateur movie lover, I never studied film so there are certainly several finer points of good film making that go over my head. I can however appreciate a wide variety of movies for many reasons such as good, likable characters, clever/witty writing and dialog, cinematography etc. Sadly, this film possessed none of these qualities.

In a nut shell, it's listed and sold as a comedy yet I didn't so much as grin throughout. I quite dislike every character in it, especially that of Ben Stiller. If I actually knew any of these people I would quickly distance myself from them. Finally it has no redeeming features such as striking/beautiful imagery or an interesting story where things actually happen.

Judging by other reviews this seems to be a movie one has to "get" in order to enjoy. I can accept that up to a certain extent but if that's the case at least try include a few things for those poor souls fooled into thinking it was a comedy. This is the only film that I have ever seen where I am literally left with nothing good to say about it.

Noah Baumbach recent efforts Margot At The Wedding and the Squid And The Whale, were both fine films, so I was interested in seeing his latest Greenberg. Ben Stiller stars in this as a man struggling with his life, who meets a woman and begins a romance with her. Greenberg is a very unlikable person at times, although he often reminds one of some neurotic Woody Allen creation and has at times a certain charm. Stiller is very toned down in this and a such does a good job. Stealing his limelight is Greta Gerwig as Florence who gives a fine performance here. Florence is a little odd in her ways and so there is perhaps a connection between the two, but if this is meant to be a character study, it fails to be anything but a study in dullness. So very little happens, that it's difficult to maintain interest and with a unlikable main character, the film plods along, to the point where I longed for the credits to start.

It's a shame the film falls flat, especially when you consider previous efforts from Baumbach. Whilst there are some things going for it, mostly in performances, including a good supporting role from Rhys Ifans, there is very little going for it, especially when it runs at nearly 2hrs, it's a tough film experience.

A serious warning, if you are on anti-depressants, do not watch this movie.

Gave up after 1 hour into this "movie", ejected the DVD and snapped it in half, and then into fourths, just to make sure I never accidentally start to watch this awful waste of life movie again. Roger (Ben Stiller) and Florence (Greta Gerwig) are two annoying whiny wishy-washy people that alternate between intercourse and arguing without rhyme or reason, and I simply could not bear another scene of these two whiners that began around the 60 minute mark.

Reminds me of a SNL skit "The Whiners", which was kinda funny for the first minute of the sketch, but then got old real quick. This movie seems to last 4 hours but has a runtime of 107 minutes, and I only watched the first 60...

I am now officially adding Ben Stiller to my list of never watch a movie with them starring again, which includes Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel, Eddie Murphy, John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Jessica Alba, and Jim Carrey. Eight of the least interesting, least funny, and least watchable actors on the planet.

Graphic designer Milton Glaser has a great quote about healthy vs toxic friendships:

"There is a test to determine whether someone is toxic or nourishing in your relationship with them. Here is the test: You have spent some time with this person, either you have a drink or go for dinner or you go to a ball game. It doesn't matter very much but at the end of that time you observe whether you are more energized or less energized. Whether you are tired or whether you are exhilarated. If you are more tired then you have been poisoned. If you have more energy you have been nourished." 

With this in mind, Roger Greenberg (aka Ben Stiller), take a hike, you are poison, and I never want to see you again.

Noah Baumbach has been known to combined off-putting and painfully real with comedy in the world of the 80's teen, 1960's born, neurotic, indie loving, damaged, scared therefore held back in 'societies eyes' person whom is now in their forties and always seems high because they're so neurotic. Doing this well as based on his own experiences and life on this earth as 'The squid and the whale' and especially 'Margot at the wedding' (One of his best and most original efforts) showed us and with the inspiration of Jon Brion coated movies like 'Punch-drunk love' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' Noah Baumbach has made a painfully real and awkward but surprisingly sweet, accessible and most detailed movie about not knowing when it's time to change as time moves unnoticeable fast.

Roger Greenberg essentially reminds me of myself, as when things don't go my way and it's my fault expect others to notice and help me, or I freak out. Roger also wipes his nose with his hand when nervous or intimated Through-out all his movies, Noah knows exactly how to pin-point jealously and insecurities of the neurotic. With this, Ben Stiller strips himself of his normal mainstream straight guy 'Meet The Parents' routine and give us his actual geeky, uncomfortably weird, held back, extremely passive aggressive, frustrated, pretentious inner-self, and for most of 'Greenberg' I forgot you were Ben Stiller, Ben Stiller excellent.

Though 'Greenberg' takes a more accessible and familiar, less off-putting approach, not to say 'Greenberg' isn't extremely awkward at times, there are none-the-less, slight glimpses of Noah's other films in 'Greenberg' that obviously give an edge to the other oddball romantic misanthrope movies I munched and maybe fun for Noah experts to notice. Greenberg sometimes comes off as an indie parody, as some may see it like that, but I think that works in a way as Greenberg is essentially a parody of himself, as he sort of believes at times like many, that having an irate opinion and being pretentious has any sort of merit or distinguishing qualities, when really it's just rude. Greenberg is the person who can't find fault in himself, who walks all over people who are too shy to say something, who doesn't realize he's jumping on everyone for nothing and that's why some people don't like him, but at the same time you can't help to but feel sorry for Greenberg because he's trapped in his brain like many of us and like many of us were the ones who are too shy to say something, and if we'd just relax things, would be better.

'Greenberg' successfully flipped the mirror on a generation of two decades (The 90s and 00s) of pretentious, underground loving, mainstream shoving bohemians that just because your seen as unique, doesn't make you any different from anyone who pushes people away and excludes others for not seeing their way.

How on earth people would put this together, look at it, and then say "Yes, let's release it with our name on it" is beyond me. Unlikable characters doing unbelievable things (what 25 year old would even look at an ugly-mannered, mean-spirited, nasty 41 year old? Self destructive is one thing, but this is just horrible to watch. I'm sick and tired of so- called indy movies following the Hollywood line of all the old guys get the young chicks, no question. Ivan and the main girl's friend are the only believable characters in the movie and I'm sad I wasted an evening on it. The cover said "Stunning" - sure, if they mean "to render senseless. There are much better movies covering the same themes.

Ben Stiller is always a safe bet, and this movie is no exception to that rule, it's just a bit dull, sad, and broken. Filled to the brim with great talent, and written very well, there is just no real moment of victory, just a lot of defeat. I re-watched it today in order to give a fresh review, but now I remember I was not able to finish it last time, it was just that drab, and uninspiring. Really if there is anything to take from this movie, as in life is that you always need a real skill to fall back on like Solomon's violin playing. The sad factor is the point of this movie, I get it, and Ironicly I was actually going through a similar experience when this movie first came out, it is just that Stiller plays it too well I think. Juno Temple as an Australian is kind of silly, but he needed that torture to set him on the right path. You can't say I didn't get the story, it just wasn't something that I Enjoyed watching. I can only recommend the acting, and writing of this film, of course it is filmed quite well, all of the angels are caught, I just can't recommend the actual story. unless you are looking to be brought down, then have at it.

I remember hearing good things about this film quite some time ago  mainly about relating to Stiller being in it and not playing to his usual character but doing something more "worthy", things like that. I'm never quite sure how to take praise like that, because it seems to be more to do with lauding intension rather than output, so I didn't watch this film until very recently. The opening few scenes let you in on this being an indie film, by which I mean specifically the type that will appeal to hipsters and annoy those that dislike hipsters.

I don't simply dislike films with this target audience, I really liked Noah & The Whale for example, but I do have a problem when this type of film really just goes to town on itself. I felt that was the case here and now I understand why Stiller's involvement was the main bit of praise I heard  because it really is the main thing to say about it. The story goes along slowly without any real direction other than the rambling life of Roger and his mood swings, overthinking and inherent selfishness but in fairness it is not a film to be watched for start/middle/end in the narrative. Instead it has a quite natural flow to it that I found reasonably engaging so it kept me listening, kept me interested but other than the tone I'm really not sure why. The main characters are really very self-involved and caught up in their own importance  and not in a way that they go from there but rather in a way where this is who they are throughout the film. They are well written and well delivered as characters but the film becomes like them and I was generally put off by how the whole thing started to seem smug and inward looking whereas what I really wanted was someone to come along and just shake them till they got a hold of themselves.

As annoying as I found his character, Stiller is actually very good; he totally gets his character and he plays it consistently and without any suggestion of ego of being the major Hollywood player that he is. He works well with mumblecore favourite Gerwig, who is doing her usual performance and just about manages it because she is likable whereas Stiller's character is less so. The supporting cast features small turns from Ifans, Leigh and a few others, all of whom give similar folded-in performances and match the tone of the film without making much of their time. The look of Baumbach's film is good but as writer/director he just seems happy to sit and watch his characters as they consider their own belly-buttons and on this occasion it just didn't do enough to work  he got a good performance from Stiller for sure, but beyond that? Little.

Greenberg is what you have heard  a vehicle for a comedian to prove they have value/talent by doing "proper" acting in a small indie film; I can see why Stiller did it and he does give a strong performance throughout. A shame then that there was so little else to talk about. The characters are hard to like and the film lets them just spin around each other in a way that is reasonably interesting but ultimately goes nowhere and does nothing, the end result being this feeling of inward looking smugness that one can get away with, but only in a film stronger than this one.

Melancholy and morose are two of the best adjectives to describe the Greenberg experience. Charming and offbeat would be two other great words. Sad and honest are two more words that also do the film justice. Greenberg is just a little bit of everything. Ben Stiller stars as the film's title character, Roger Greenberg. Roger is visiting Los Angeles to housesit for his brother. While in town he meets his brother's assistance, Florence, played by Greta Gerwig. The two develop a rocky relationship as Roger tries to balance his feelings for Florence with his desire to do absolutely nothing with his life, having just gotten out of a mental hospital. The film is a slap to the face of all the romantic comedies out there that follow the standard Hollywood formula. Greenberg is the anti-romcom that tells it how it is, not idealizing love or relationships and building the awkwardness of life that surrounds us all whether we want it to or not.

This is the kind of film that tries to capture the melancholy world view which we see outside of films which are so idealized in their perfect little worlds of fiction. A lot of films will fail at this and swing towards being over-dramatic and unrealistic. However, Greenberg plays it at just the right level to where it works perfectly. It's a bleak look at romantic life at times, but not so bleak that I can't believe everything the characters do and say. The story is paced and structured so well and so intelligently as keen cleverness makes the movie better from scene to scene. It is a very focused film that knows what it is doing at all times, but it also has plenty of subplots which keep it fresh and interesting. However, there's always a centralized focus of the film on the character of Roger Greenberg that is never lost or forgotten. Greenberg is shows the utmost expertise in storytelling.

But if I had to pick one thing that makes Greenberg work so well it would have to be its characters. From the central characters of Roger and Florence all the way down to the dog Mauller, every character is interesting and serves a purpose. Each and every player of the film is incredibly well written and acted. They all have back stories which play into the overall story of the film and they all have distinct personalities. They are also written together very well, the relationships being structured and intertwined brilliantly. The character interaction is profoundly human and completely believable, making these not just characters on a page, but bringing them to life as truly believable human beings which we grow our own connections with. Greenberg not only knows how to tell a great story, but it knows how to develop its characters just as well.

This is just an all around excellent film. It may have a few minuscule problems, but they aren't even worth mentioning because it's the big picture that matters with a film like this. And the big picture is excellent and it's a stunning portrayal of real life in all of its melancholy glory. This is a film that we can believe and its a story that only comes around once in a while like this.We see the core of the story so much in romantic comedies, but not like this, in a way that triumphs over the obvious and cliché and almost mocks the typical fare of the genre. It's a truly great film that should not be missed.
