### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
What can I say? Maybe I'm just becoming a curmudgeon but I just don't find the fact that Dory lost her parents as a child and has been looking for them ever since very (read: at all) interesting. The movie opens with Dory as a small child, who features in several flashbacks thereafter. The cuteness factor of young Dory has been dialed up to 11 in a rather obvious attempt to invest the audience in Dory's plight that much more. But, to me, it just came off as saccharine.

The movie wasn't very plausible either. Yes, I am fully aware this is a cartoon aimed at kids. But we're expected to believe Dory, having severe (and entirely plot-driven) memory loss somehow found her way as a small child from California all the way to Australia all by herself.

Anyway, if I'd been able to find the basic plot interesting, I might have forgiven the movie's list of other other implausibilities and errors but, as it is, they just come off as irritating, and in service of a dull story. Some example:

- An octopus (actually, a "septapus", as it's missing a tentacle; more on that later) that can not only stay out of water indefinitely and disguise itself as anything, but can also learn to drive a car within seconds and drive it blind with only Dory to guide him.

- A fish tank in the kiddie section of an aquarium, where the kids are allowed to grab the creatures within the tank. This, incidentally, is where the octopus lost a tentacle because a kid pulled it off. And the aquarium was totally okay with this and let the kids go on grabbing fish. GTFOOH Pixar.

- The octopus finds himself back in the tank where kids can freely grab them. Conveniently, he forgets he can essentially become invisible, to force tension into the plot

- The octopus steers a stroller past milling throngs of people, none of whom think it very remarkable.

- Whale sharks are not whales and do not eat fish. This is the most egregious, or at least most irritating, error committed by this film. Did Pixar not do research or did they just not care? Honestly, I find this error shocking coming from Pixar.

- Several fish-eating animals are seen throughout this movie that are only to happy to forget their dietary requirements: sea lions, loons, otters, it doesn't matter. The otters are even willing to risk their lives for this fish they don't know to help her do something about which they have no way of knowing anything. At least in the fIrst movie, there was some explanation given as to why pelicans and sharks would not eat fish. Here, it's just whatever serves the plot. It just feels lazy and cheap.

- I have a feeling echolocation doesn't work anything like it's portrayed here, but I won't make too much of it. But, wow, did that "whale speak" get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.

I have usually considered Pixar to feature strong characters, but after THE GOOD DINOSAUR and this movie, I'm disappointed in how dull and/or annoying the characters are. Dory was fine as a supporting player (and in a better movie) but as the star, she's simply insufferable. 

Overall, I have always considered Pixar as synonymous with quality. But no longer. It will no longer be a given that a Pixar movie is going to be a winner.

Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed

Finding Dory wins just one miserable star, for one reason: The animation throughout is astonishingly realistic.

However, almost everything else about the film is a train wreck of ocean-sized proportions. Take no notice of the reviews of the critics, who seem to be doing everything to try and defend this horribly misguided mess.

But how is it a mess? Here's why. The whole film just fails to give you a reason to want to sit through all of it again. It doesn't feel like a proper story, instead more like a series of antics and ideas thrown into an overflowing, ugly mix. It's chaotic, too long and so stupid at times that it has to be seen to be believed. This is easily one of Pixar's worst.

Finding Dory's most egregious flaw as its shockingly incompetent pacing. The film is frantic, mindless and over-concerned with shoving in jokes and sight gags. Scenes are so rushed and so needlessly silly that they just aren't believable. Introduced characters get little development and are just forgettable. Will anyone really remember or care about Hank the octopus, Destiny the whale shark or those argumentative sea-lions in the future?

The film's strict adherence to sequel clich√©s also seriously crosses the line. Returning plot elements, rehashed scenarios, character cameos and overblown action scenes are all here and are never justified. In fact, by the end of it, the entire film hasn't even justified its existence. Furthermore, the characters suffer so much bad luck that it eventually turns into "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" with fish. Everything starts going wrong. Detours are constantly taken. Death is cheated over and over. And yet, the characters constantly escape via methods so contrived and convenient that it's impossible to take seriously. Admittedly, it's kind of creative in places, but it's also as predictable as you can imagine.

The climax, however, is where the film finally crashes into the ground. It's astoundingly awful. Picture this - an octopus driving a lorry extremely poorly and not crashing into any oncoming cars. A large group of otters hugging each other in the middle of the road in order to stop these cars. And finally, the same lorry being driven over a hill and into the sea. This is the climax simplified - except that it's way, way worse than that. It can't even describe how bad it is. It's a horribly written climax and is jaw-droppingly nonsensical.

Why stop there? The film fails in so many other ways that you can play bingo with its flaws. There are way too many flashbacks to Dory's cutesy childhood. "Emotional" scenes are dull and stretched thin. Marlin and Nemo are in it, but mean little to the plot. A scene where a bunch of kids are touching some sea life, who are shown feeling the constant pain, is not at all funny but uncomfortable. Several scenes, like one with a talking clam, just feel shoved in for no reason. Many jokes fall flat. The dialogue is stale and charmless. I could go on and on.

The whole thing is an embarrassing atrocity. As much as I'd love to give more stars to this movie, I feel it deserves just one. Because the bad aspects of this movie are so bad, they essentially undo the good ones. Yes, it's well-animated. Yes, it has some very minor charming parts. Yes, it can be creative at times. But everything else about the film is brainless to a damning extreme. Finding Nemo worked because it was melancholic, tear-jerking and uplifting. It resonated with everyone. Its sequel has almost none of what made the original a masterpiece.

I did not enjoy this film at all. First of all, the title makes no sense. Dory is looking for her parents, whilst Marlin and Nemo are just chasing after her. That part is not interesting. The new characters seemed like generic movie side characters and didn't impress me. It does seem like Dory was faking her short term memory loss. The fact she was looking for her family and then first met Marlin, does not work for me. I do not recommend this film as it was disappointing and wasn't as entertaining and appealing as Finding Nemo was. I wouldn't watch it again and once again do not recommend this disappointing film. This is all just my opinion.

(There aren't many spoilers in this review)

I've seen Finding Nemo again just recently; I wouldn't say I liked it now but I could see why a kid would. It has action, adventure, likable characters, colorful animation, and a good plot. Unfortunately the sequel hasn't got much of these.

A kid probably wouldn't like this film, it has mostly dialogue throughout. When it does have action, it doesn't have any consequence like I said earlier, so that's boring. Sure - you meet a few funny characters along the film's journey, but they have little purpose but to say a wise-crack joke and then offer the main character help for no reason. The film relies on your nostalgia of Finding Nemo to like it, the entire beginning of the movie shoves reference-after-reference into the audiences face. The movie is very colorful, though. The music was very underwhelming for a Pixar movie; they usually have really good scores even if they're bad movies, not this one. The character designs are just as cartoony as the first film, with an exception of the humans which all look like the copy-paste designs from Inside-Out.

Whoever they got to do Nemo's voice was not a good actor, every time he was on screen he said something overly-dramatic and bad. Albert Brooks (Marlin) sounded like he didn't want to be in the voice- booth. Ellen DeGeneres (Dory) did fine, but that doesn't make the character any less annoying and repetitive. The line, "I have short- term memory loss," was probably said 100 times.

Finding Dory suffers what Pixar has been suffering for years now, a badly written story. Everything that happens in the movie happens because of coincidence, the characters actions rarely have consequences. Pixar has been doing this in all of their recent films and I don't know how people are still intrigued by them. The film also has the clich√©d Pixar plot-line of having 2 unlikely companions going on an adventure. The only Pixar movies that don't do this include: The Incredibles, Brave, and maybe Bug's Life.

I wouldn't recommend Finding Dory; I would recommend Finding Nemo, though.

Sorry but this just didn't work.. the story line was tired to say the least. Whilst there were a few subtle pastiches to keep parents interested there weren't enough. and even my four year old got down from their seat and came over to ask me "Is it finishing soon ? I'm bored." My nine year old managed to keep awake throughout which is his usual way of showing his view on a film so maybe it's not all bad. But with the current cost of Cinema (movie house) tickets (¬£30 $40) in London I did feel somewhat disappointed. This was a Disney Pixar production was we had our anticipation set by their previous material, but this was a low point on their output. From Finding Nemo a sequel was obviously going to make an appearance. This admittedly didn't give the writers much scope for a story. But they needed to have included more comical asides within the main story and increased the pace of the second quarter.

It's not as good as the first one, but it's a nice follow up. This isn't one of Pixar's film that will become a classic. But it's a movie that kids will have a lot of fun with and is watchable for adults. It isn't a Pixar movie with a lot of depth, deep meaning and messages when it comes to the story. But it's a simple and yet creative movie about Dory who has short-term memory trying to find her parents. With the help of her friends and acquaintances. Sure it can get tedious at times and it isn't a movie I would watch over and over again. But what makes this simple movie work is it's creativity and the situations the fishes and other sea animals gets into. And creative ways they go about it when trying to get out of danger and finding their way to certain locations. This isn't a sequel that I felt was necessary but it doesn't take anything away either.

One huge problem about Pixar is that they have been releasing too many long awaited sequels (and a prequel) like Toy Story 3 (which was even better than One and Two),Monsters University and recently this one.

PLOT:The plot is too similar to Finding Nemo.Firstly,our protagonist (Dory) gets lost,her friends (Marlin and Nemo) go on a long journey to find her,at the aquarium she makes new friends,including an octopus who wants to escape and her old friend a whaleshark,she is briefly reunited with her friends and family,she is rescued and the gang returns home with new friends.The only differences are she gets lost while looking for her lost parents,it takes place in an aquarium in California,the new friends are the octopus,the whaleshark and the orca,and in the climax she is saved from a truck.

CHARACTERS:Film makers will never learn that giving the comic relief character his/her own story is not a good idea.

HUMOUR:Nearly half the jokes in this film fall flat,like Sigourney Weaver is the host of the aquarium.COME ON PIXAR YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT!!!! In conclusion,Finding Dory robs the audiences worth $1.056 billion worldwide and felt like remake,not a sequel.

... rather than using a story to demonstrate dazzling CGI. This film was just as good as its predecessor, Finding Nemo. In this film (which takes place one year after 'Nemo'), Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss, makes it a mission to find her parents. She helped Marlon find Nemo in the first film and now she wants help locating her parents. She became separated from them when she was young and until now, has relied on others to help her find her way. She also gets by with her unique brand of impulsiveness and quick action. Throughout the film, Dory uses other "people's" (fishes'?) words and objects to trigger memories that assist her in finding her way. It was very clever how Pixar incorporated these triggers to help move the story along and flesh out Dory's background. I also liked how they treated short term memory loss with sensitivity and did not make it a joke. The marine center that Dory & co. end up at is based on the excellent Monterrey Bay Aquarium. The funniest new character added to the Nemo franchise is Hank the octopus (except he only has seven legs as Dory points out and refers to him as a "septapus."). Hank is cynical, but you know he's a softy deep inside. He can also camouflage himself into his settings which is quite comical. There are other funny characters like Becky the buzzard and Gerald the seal with a uni-brow.

It seems that Pixar thrives on adding emotional scenes to their films that pull at their audience's heartstrings. Finding Dory is no exception. There is a very dramatic scene near the end of the film where Dory is separated from her party and is lost in an unfamiliar, dark ocean, alone. She has to rely on herself to figure out how to find her way out and find her friends. This was a very heart wrenching scene. I won't lie, it made me tear up and I could hear other people sniffling in the theater. Another emotional scene is the beginning of the film showing a baby Dory with her parents. It's not as sad though as the beginning of Up, though.

I'd recommend this one.

Movies today are very commercial, we all know this. I've been going to animated type films with my granddaughter for many years and God bless, she always says she loves them all.

And so she did with Finding Dory but I was disgusted the entire movie.

First, we did see it in 3D, something I seldom do because I don't see the benefit of the extra money. But in the case of THIS movie, it is the one good thing I could say about it. This movie, under the sea, the marine life, the beautiful color, was gorgeous in 3D.

Now let's discuss the very, very stupid plot of this movie.

We begin by asserting that we do understand that giving animals human like traits is very common and I don't have a problem with this. It's part of the joy of watching, adds to the understanding, gives a depth to the plot.

But come on people, a fish with a short term memory problem? That's a rare thing even in humans for goodness sake, much less a fish with a brain smaller than a pea.

It's just too much to buy into is my complaint, that a fish manages to go through life forgetting everything is just learned because of this brain anomaly.

And the plot is very far-fetched, with fish hijacking trucks and flying with birds and translating fish water echoes into visual sights.

Seems Dory, the star of the movie and one of the fish who saved Elmo, an animate film from many years ago that was much more believable, lost her parents and the story is about Dory's determination to find them.

And Dory, come on, she's the only fish in the movie with buck teeth and why is this? Because Ellen DeGeneres, the voice of Dory, has teeth exactly like the cartoon fish and this was just so obvious. I like Ellen DeGeneres and consider she was a perfect voice for Dory, but DeGeneres has never met a promotional opportunity that she'd let pass by. Including having a fish with her voice look like her.

The story has a bunch of fish helping Dory find her parents and we've got seashell trails and forgetful Dory and a silly plot that looked as if a bunch of people threw a bunch of idea confetti on the table and an absurd story was somehow concocted.

Of course we have Dory stuff at McDonald's and Pixar, AKA Disney, will make money on this fluff thrown together with little care save for the merchandise and revenue.

Come on producers and directors out there! You got to have a little pride when crafting an animated movie. The color and 3D of "Finding Dory" ain't going to cut it.

This movie is best for someone five years old or less, someone who won't laugh at the silly concept of a forgetful fish.

The movie itself was in my opinion disappointing. Maybe it's just me being grown up (which I doubt) but the movie was just lacking so much. Didn't laugh or even smile once throughout the movie. It was just meh i didn't feel like there was any humor in the movie and there wasn't any exciting parts either. After more than 10 years from finding Nemo to this it's just disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying it's not as good as expected. There wasn't any part where i felt danger or where i felt that dory getting lost was actually important at all Music didn't make me feel anything through the whole movie. Animation could've been better as well. Could probably still be a good movie for kids but for people who already watched finding Nemo and who watches lots of movies its just not worth the money

Okay - Blackfish apparently caused a rewrite of the movies ending, presumably the species of the character Destiny. Okay... Pretty sure the writers had enough time to do some research and figure out that a whale-shark is not in fact a whale, and doesn't eat fish... Why not just feed the fish into the beluga's tank? Why not have the beluga 'speak whale' instead? We get it, it's a cartoon - but willful suspension of disbelief is lost when my 3 year old is calling out this sort of stuff (granted, he's been fortunate enough to go to the aquarium in Atlanta) There is no magic in Dory - in fact, it's greatest problem may be that there's too much Dory. In the first she acted as a great foil to Marlin - here... well... There's no foil for Dory.

Watch it again - as stated earlier, got a three year old so it might happen. Pay to watch it again? No. Do it by choice? No. Allow my kid to watch it again? Sure, there's worse, but then again, there's better too: frankly, "A Turtle's Tale 2" was better, with a fresher recycled soundtrack even with a remarkably similar plot line.

Currently Rotten Tomatoes is giving it a 'certified fresh' rating - I'm left wondering if there is an octopus writing their critical reviews.

I was super disappointed in this film, given that it was rated 4.5 stars. It had way too much of Dory. I wish I had a nickel for every time she mentioned she has memory problems; I'd be stinking rich. Trust me, the bad memory shtick gets very old after a short time.

If you love Dory, yes you will like the movie. But if Dory all the time is a bit much for you, you will get bored by this fast. The new whale characters just were not very interesting either. The 2 grand-kids liked Finding Dory OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. This is not the first time I've been disappointed in a highly-rated kids film, 5 stars just doesn't mean the quality it did in the past.

The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky because I like birds. Saying it's a kids' movie doesn't cut it since adults watch the movie, too. And yes, they're talking fish, but against everything else, you might as well have put a rabbit in the water and gave it underwater-breathing powers with the way this film is structured. 

Why would a solitary clownfish in the Great Barrier Reef know what California was, let alone where? How did he find the migrating turtles again and so easily? Why did they bring Nemo on the adventure? Not to mention, within the coast of California is a pocket of cold water that brings in sweet spawning fish but threatening temperatures to the tropical fish friends. Toxins and pH levels are a big thing for fish, and Marlin and Dory are no exceptions, so why California of all places? Wouldn't it have made sense to just create a fake aquarium in Australia and have the gang go there?

Octopi do have the ability to camouflage and stay out of water for periods of time, but the speed at which Hank moves is disturbing and too quick for a real octopus. At that point, we'd have lots of land-dwelling, rock-hopping octopi on our beaches, would't we? And there really was no point of Hank wanting to live his life out peacefully in a tank if he was going to die in a couple of years if he was lucky. Octopi sadly don't live very long despite their high intelligence. 

Speaking of intelligence, how did Dory learn to read? Who taught her? If it was her parents, who taught them? Were there--pardon me--schools of fish to teach the English language? Dory also speaks whale, but Destiny is not a whale; she is a shark, a fish. she's also a fish that can leap completely out of an enclosure which doesn't make sense because she doesn't have the capability of swimming fast enough to gain enough velocity to propel her enormous weight out of said water. 

I also feel bad because when it said Dory was part of the open ocean exhibit and I see all these fish bunched up in a tall column of water, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all of the sunfish, sharks, tuna, and turtles that obviously weren't crammed in the appropriate exhibit name. You couldn't even get the name of the exhibit right. Open ocean means open ocean, not claustrophobic tropical reef pipe. 

Bailey's echolocation is over-powered. Echolocation doesn't work the same out of water as it does in the water. How did the sound travel so far and span out across a 360-degree area and feed into his brain fast enough for him to process the spatial awareness around him? 

The water-hopping with Marlin and Nemo wasn't great, either. They went from cold California-hardened seawater to freshwater to mop water and then to fresh/seawater again. In the case that the changes in water didn't kill them, they would be very very sick. Also how is Nemo still a kid? It's been a year. "He" should have reached sexual maturity by now, and he should've matured into a she with the current (ha) conditions. 

Why are Dory's parents still alive? Blue tangs need warm water to survive. How did they live in the cold California Pacific for that long? What about in winter when the temperatures and currents change? Pixar, your studio is a hop and a skip away to the ocean. What happened to consulting marine biologists on this? 

Do people genuinely find it funny when an octopus and blue tang hijack a van with hundreds of fishy lives and pile it through busy traffic, potentially killing and harming dozens of innocent people? I'd hope not, but that's what I got from this movie. 

At the end of the movie, everyone followed them all the way back to the Great Barrier Reef. Beluga whales live in cold waters where their proper food spawn. Doesn't that put stress on Bailey? What if I threw the writers of this film into the Antarctic to join their penguin friends without proper equipment and told them to find food and shelter without any knowledge of the area? Is that heartwarming and entertaining? No.

The movie itself, was really bland. I almost envisioned the whole thing as a high-budget movie-based video game with smooth graphics. The areas are divided specifically like dungeons with obstacles and stealth sequences. However, nothing in the movie stood out to me in memory. I don't remember any dialogue being spoken from the characters, I had little care for the fish. 

This movie didn't even feel like a movie. It's like they got middle-school writers to write a G-rated fan-fiction "Finding Nemo" adventure for their 4-year old sibling who wanted a story about Dory finding her parents because of a single exchange of dialogue uttered in the film. I think it was deliberately made because someone wanted to make another movie just because? I'm not sure, so don't take it seriously, but if that was the case, then it clearly shows. 

The kids might like this film. Disney-blind consumers and Pixar enthusiasts might like it, but not me. I felt like I spent the course of 2 hours verbally criticizing this garbage with my family, and that, coupled with Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky's cameo, were the only forms of entertainment I got out of it all. Not the story, not the characters, and definitely not the writing or logic. Oh gosh, it was bad.

Those who loved "Finding Nemo" will anticipate some adventures under the water, which "Finding Dory" caters. Just like the previous film, which has gained a cult status, the animation and sequences are pretty marvelous. I guess it would be much more a lavish experience if you watch it on a big screen. It takes you to the world inside the water under the seas, pipes, aquariums, and buckets. Through the superb animation and a fast pace, it holds you and entertains you for its entire length. Though there is a lot of happenings in the film, it is not an improvement over "Finding Nemo," in terms of story or characters. Dory lacks the charm spelled by Nemo; and it kinda drops to unbelievable clich√©s in the end. In comparison, "Finding Nemo" is still preferable.

I went to watch this with my man and his employee and it was disappointing. I have Finding Nemo on DVD and like it very much. My only merits for this film are for the noble intentions of Nemo and his father, besides that, this is almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back, this film drags on so much that by the first hour I felt like I'd spent a full day watching it and on top of that I still had very little connection to the characters and their story hadn't even started. Second hour hit, still nothing, I was almost asleep. hahahaaha an octopus that is missing tentacles, not really. I might as well have been asleep, the story was still stagnant. As a sequel, it's like watching paint dry, it just doesn't get going. If you have the time to spare and have nothing better to do or watch then by all means, watch this film, but if you have something better do with your time then please, avoid this film. The length of the film doesn't justify the lack of story or the cinematic prowess, this could very easily have been a half hour short film. I can say none of us enjoyed much about this film. My bf thought it was empty and his employee thought it was strictly for children whereas the prequel was for children and adults. On the bright side we went home afterwards and had good satisfying sex until midnight so it was a good day.

Do you really truly want to watch over an hour of Dory getting lost and then somehow finding her way back AGAIN and her short term memory problem? Because that's why this movie is all about.

In the previous film Dory was cute and quirky because she had few lines and was along for the ride in the search for Nemo. And all of the characters from the first film are involved this time around. Nemo, his dad, the stingray and sea turtles are there. But in this movie, not even Nemo or his father want to babysit Dory anymore. They have their own lives to live. And while Dory searching for her lost family in this one, she finds herself getting lost and being taken advantage of by all the new characters.

The Disney Pixar's animation is superb as to be expected. The story is seriously lacking. I found myself dozing off. My children lost interest about halfway through the film. It's still a good movie though if you're a fan of Dory.

I am still a kid at heart and never miss out on a Disney or Pixar film, ever. But this one establishes two problems for children who have been adopted or are in foster care. 

First - Dory is, as we all know, forgetful, and that is why she was separated from her parents, thus - it is HER FAULT. 

Second - Dory has loving, friendly parents who are emotionally and mentally stable and have been actively looking for her for years, therefor perpetuating most adopted / fostered children's fantasies regarding their birth parents, but is most often NOT the case. This is grossly unfair to any child not anticipating this theme in the film, did Pixar forget how literal children are? 

So be thoughtful and take the time to see this insensitive film before taking your children. Even birth children need to have a talk with their parents about NOT making adoptive friends / classmates feel that this could be the outcome if they are adopted. Our adopted daughter years for a relationship with her birth mother, and we are actively looking for her and praying for a good end result. Many times birth parents want nothing to do with their birth children. 

Again, Pixar really dropped the ball on this one, for all the screaming this industry does to be sensitive to most groups of people, I guess they didn't bother to give a second thought to this particular group.

Sequels are tough. Even though we live in a strange new age where sequels are already planned and penned seven chapters ahead of time, in movie form as to squash out all of the detail and description a television series could properly do, sequels are still tough. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS goes something like this: The first movie was slightly stale popcorn. The second was trying too hard to be funny. The third was about the same as the first, just in a different location. The fourth turned out to be a bit more interesting when they started playing with the timeline. The sixth was too serious, the seventh was too gritty. Overall, popcorn. Most of it stale, or at least past its prime.

I skipped FAST FIVE on purpose, because of all of the FAST movies, it's easily the best. It takes the best of the slapstick that makes the movies bearable, mixes it with the best of jokes, and just overall has a blast with itself, never daring to take itself too seriously or try to bog us down in soap opera-style deaths while making yet another point about the importance of family (which is yet another reason why I think 8 will collapse, but more on that some other time).

Making franchises, to me, is like having half a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread. Your task is to somehow spread what little peanut butter you've got over the length of the entire loaf. You can't use too much in any particular spot, so what you end up with is a thin layer of flavor over a stack of wheat slices, which by the time you're finished, leaves you wishing for anything other than peanut butter on bread, and may traumatize you from ever eating it again.

That being said, there are, of course, flawed gemstones in the midst of the bread. A moment where you became frustrated, and said, "screw this, I'm going to indulge myself!" and slapped a little too much on that middle slice, just so you could get some joy out of it. Thereby jeopardizing the rest of the loaf, unfortunately.

Sorry for the long intro.

FINDING DORY is not a good sequel. Shticks that are put into movies that test our ability to suspend belief are best used sparingly, and this is not something anyone that made this movie really stopped to care about. In FINDING NEMO, most of the action was underwater, and when the fish needed to jump locations, it was done carefully, tip-toeing the edge of where believability would be lost.

FINDING DORY simply doesn't care. The logic is to just throw caution to the wind and hope for the best. "Just keep swimming, just keep swimming" ends up becoming less of a mantra for the kindhearted Dory and more of a directive for the entire film, a kind of sweeping message designed to keep you in the game, so to speak, so you won't think too hard about the complete lack of logic presented here.

Tearjerker moments involving Dory's youth take a lot away from the comedy of NEMO, where what could have been a very dark tale of desperation and despair was turned into a fun adventure, and sometimes we're left with that empty-hole feeling, that all-too painful reality of just how hard it would be for someone who truly lived with short term memory loss to live a happy life. I'm reminded of MEMENTO, and that's not something I should be thinking about when watching a film of this caliber. Pixar has always been good at touching the darker side of reality, but only with a light touch, and never one that doesn't have some resolution down the line. While we do have resolution here, it's not a complete payoff as is the case with other films of this kind, because Dory is still Dory, in the end. Will she even remember the journey she's taken, and the point of it all? Pixar's golden age has come to an end, and it's sad to see, from a guy who's found an awful lot to love about their films. I'm supposed to get excited about CARS 3, when I didn't really think CARS was on the same level as so many other Pixar gems, and then CARS 2 which turned out to be nothing more than a giant commercial for churning out Disney merchandise. Needless to say, I don't have any high expectations for Lightning McQueen's 3rd expo into Maynard jokes and inexplicable competition woes.

TOY STORY 4 is coming. I haven't seen TOY STORY 3, but it's one of those films that you end up hearing about because of its overall impact, and there is a certain sense of finality about it that is something I truly appreciate in films. I've always thought, regarding movies, that three is the lucky number, the perfect pattern for a fictional reflection of life: It begins. It lives. It ends. It's how it should be.

So I guess we're looking at FAST AND THE FURIOUS logic infecting everything. As long as we're making moolah, churn out those overpriced theater tickets. How many Toy Stories are waiting for us, just around the corner? How many slices of bread are we headed for, with just enough peanut butter gracing the ridges of the wheat as to tell our mouths what we are eating, without really being able to derive any pleasure from it, because of how much is lacking? Are we facing a time when, as in SOYLENT GREEN, Charlton Heston sucks what's left of the remains of jam off of a dirty spoon, just to tearfully remember a time when food was delicious¬Ö 

Instead of just filling?

The long-awaited sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo seems to exist in a much bleaker universe than it's predecessor. Despite the 13-year gap, there is a clear shift here toward a more issues-centric film which attempts to primarily tackle common per- (and mis-)conceptions of disability (both mental and physical. The way that title character, Dory, is treated for example, is a little close to home and clearly intends to do so. Meanwhile, supporting characters such as: Hank (the septopus); Becky (seagull); and Gerald (sea lion) are each given turns to be routinely ridiculed by their peers (even Marlin!), undermined, oppressed or generally downtrodden.

Thankfully, each is given somewhat of an opportunity to succeed in the face of animosity and this, combined with the joyous cameos of Cockney Sea lions, a short-sighted Whaleshark and fan-favourite Crush, do provide moments of light amongst the general dour atmosphere the film appears determined to remain confined to.

My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. 

This is mostly a sequel to the early 'Finding Nemo' where Dory, a blue fish with the inability to form new short-term memories, becomes the key to tracking down Nemo, caught and taken away by novelty fish hunters. In that story part of Dory's skill is the ability to talk to whales.

While this movie is mostly a sequel, when an older Dory begins to remember she had a mom and dad, it actually begins when Dory was a new hatchling and depicts how she wandered away in the first place.

While 'Finding Dory' is a rather pleasant 90 minutes it doesn't have the invention and charm of the earlier movie. Dory does work her way over to the facility on the California Coast, uses her ability to talk to whales, and has to use the help of a very inventive Septopus (he lost one tentacle), to eventually join her family again.

Just so-so entertainment.

There must be something in the water at Pixar! After their 2003 triumph Finding Nemo, Pixar continued the famous aquatic trios' adventure in the sequel, Finding Dory. Pixar uses their ability to create realistic animation mixed with the voices of many famous actors to hold their spot at the top of the cartoon universe. In this similar but different sequel, Nemo's heroine Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fun, lovable, but often forgetful fish has an adventure of her own. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, but she starts to have short flashbacks of where she came from. As she ventures to find her family, Dory is joined by Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Pixar's newest eight-legged hero, an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neil) who helps her in many tight spots along the journey. She is also reunited and helped by some of her old childhood friends along the way. As far as sequels go, the plot to Finding Dory is far too similar to Finding Nemo. Pixar follows almost the exact plot line, except for parents looking for their child, it is a child looking for their parents. There is no creativity in the plot set up for this movie, however the similarity is not a disappointment. It allows for Pixar to up the ante when it comes to the new animation technology, the script, and the actors, and they did just that. With the advancement in technology, and the ability to create animation increases in movies, adds to the wonder of this movie. Compared to the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, this film has many more intricate details regarding the animation. The primary background of the ocean water flows extremely fluidly. Also, way the fish maneuver throughout the water is remarkably life-like, one might think they are swimming with the fish. Not to mention the ray of colors within this film are as vibrant as ever. Pixar deserves an A+ with this one! Besides the amazing animation, the cast line up for this movie is also absolutely incredible. Day time talk show host and comedian, Ellen DeGeneres is flawless as Dory, while the hilarious Ed O'Neal and Ty Burrell (stars of ABC's Modern Family) are along with her throughout the adventure. Not to mention countless of other familiar voices such as: Kaitlin Olson, Albert Brooks, and Diane Keaton, help add to the light heartedness of the movie. The cast chosen for this movie are high quality actors as they add many raw emotions throughout movie, giving it the ability to appeal to the emotions of people of all ages. 

If you are looking for a movie to watch alone, with friends, or even with family you can't go wrong with Finding Dory. If you missed the showings while it was in theaters do not worry as it is now out on DVD, and as of February 2017 it is up on Netflix making it accessible for everyone to watch and enjoy the "tale" of the fun, lovable, but forgetful fish, Dory.

The well-known character from Disney's Finding Nemo has now finally gotten her own spotlight. Dory, the funniest fish in the ocean thanks to her voice actress Ellen DeGeneres, is able to take on another adventure. The movie also features all the other past characters that everyone fell in love with from the start. This film is amazing because of how well the voice actors portray the characters, the emotions it brings to the audience, and its animation.

The voice actors in Finding Dory do more than an excellent job with making the animated characters come alive. The hilarious Ellen DeGeneres has once again impressed her audience in creating the amazing character that Dory is. While there are many characters that are familiar from Finding Nemo, there are new and unfamiliar ones that are great additions to the movie as well. There are many flashbacks in the film that refer back to Dory as a young girl. This adorable little fish was voice-acted by Sloane Murray, who does an exquisite job of making the audience fall in love with little Dory. Co-stars from the hit TV show Modern Family, Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill make the voices of new characters Bailey and Hank. Aside from Bailey, another whale that is unknown is Destiny, voiced by Kaitlyn Olson. All of these amazing and hilarious voice actors are crucial to making Finding Dory a great film.

There are many emotional, happy, and funny moments throughout the entire film that help make it a great story. Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane made sure to always make Dory's disability of short-term memory loss apparent from beginning to end of the movie, which sparks emotion for the audience. Finding Dory is a great especially for the younger audience in the fact that it teaches friendship, teamwork, and that your family is one of the most important things in life. It teaches that just because you have a disability doesn't mean that you can't do anything you set your mind to and you can still achieve many things in life. It also encourages risk- taking and not to be afraid of doing something just because you wouldn't normally do it. Watching this movie gives you the idea to not just sit around and do nothing for the rest of your life and to make the best of it. Reminiscing on Dory's past life makes Finding Dory that much better. Knowing what she had to go through and remembering things to help her through her journey are heart-warming and good life lessons to teach the audience. 

The animation in this film was indescribable. Its vibrant colors makes the film look very clear. Pixar never disappoints and they do an amazing job with modernizing cartoon's and fictional characters to make them more fun to watch. The beauty of the ocean's creatures and the beautiful colors that they use bring the movie to life moves Pixar to the next level. Even though prior to the sequel in the movie Finding Nemo, which was released in 2003, the characters still look and sound exactly the same. This is something that many movies and television shows lack as time goes on. It brings back the memory of Finding Nemo and the amazing characters that everyone knows and loves but adds in some hilarious ones to the mix that makes this movie different yet unforgettable.

All in all, the film Finding Dory is a must-see. It is very hard to find negative things about it and Pixar has exceeded itself once again. It is hard not to fall in love with the beautifully animated characters and the amazing voice-actors that we all love. Great movie.

"Finding Nemo" was a landmark, five-star Pixar film both in terms of visuals and locale (underwater world). "Finding Dory" takes that winning formula, tweaks it just a bit, and produces another rollicking (if slightly less groundbreaking) undersea adventure.

For a basic plot summary, "Finding Dory" focuses on Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the forgetful little blue tang fish. Early on in the film, Dory--now part of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Nemo's (Hayden Rolence) family--remembers that she once had parents of her own, and thus the trio hitch a ride with Crush (Andrew Stanton) for the currents of California. Arriving at a Sea World-esque aquatic park, Dory is helped by a number of newcomers to the franchise, such as Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil), Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and Bailey the Beluga whale (Ty Burrell).

Basically, "Finding Dory" takes the same basic plot formula (rescue adventure) of "Finding Nemo" and just breathes some new life/characters into it. This approach doesn't really break much new ground, but perhaps such a formula doesn't need to be "messed with". I was chuckling at many jokes throughout (all the new characters fit in nicely), and found myself mostly caught up in the sense of adventure.

Probably the most interesting choice of the entire experience was Disney/Pixar's focus on Dory's "disability" (short-term memory loss). For the most part, that is where the emotion of the film comes from...seeing Dory overcome her weaknesses and even turn them into strengths. Whereas in the first film Dory was pretty much played as just the comic relief, this time her personal struggles comprise the main narrative structure of the entire flick.

Why not the full five stars? Simply put: because Toy Story 2 was better than Toy Story. Somehow, someway, Disney/Pixar managed to have that sequel transcend its spectacular original, and that didn't necessarily happen here. My final star ranking would be 4.5/5.0, if able.

Overall, though, I very much enjoyed the experience of watching "Finding Dory". It's an amazing experience to look around the theater and see people of all ages enjoying the same film. I give Disney/Pixar a lot of credit for that. If you were swept away by "Finding Nemo", you'll get the same kind of adventure/comedy in "Finding Dory".

Seriously has there been a bad Pixar film? Some might not to be to all tastes (I am not the world's biggest Toy Story fan for example but I admire the quality of the films.) For those rooting for this to be the time that Pixar goes to the well too often prepare to be disappointed. This is actually a decent film. 

Good characters check. Easter eggs check. Nice visuals check.

Is it all that memorable? No. It will keep the kids entertained and adults will not suffer. While that may not be the measure of a great Pixar film it certainly is a measure of a good kids film
