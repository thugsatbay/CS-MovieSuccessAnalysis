### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Toni Erdmann starts slow and is in general a movie that takes its time. 162 minutes might suggest an overlong or very slow paced film, but in this 162 minutes we get a firework-like examination of a relationship between a father and a daughter. And yes, Toni Erdmann is a comedy. There are some moments that are so hilarious, that they gained applause mid film from the audience at my screening. But it is also a tragedy. A really complex one actually. There is so much loneliness in those characters, so much longing. Toni Erdmann is constantly entertaining, extremely well acted and emotionally compelling. A masterpiece of German cinema.

This movie is one if this rare occasions that gives you the sensation you saw something very special today. It has some kind of unique comedy status like Monty Python or Bill Murray. If you think about a serious Monty Python or a more hilarious Broken Flowers you might come close to this movie. 

The main theme is loneliness. A father realizes that his daughter is not happy even though she has a great career and pretends to be fine. So he tries to bring joy back in her life. 

The acting is brilliant both Toni and Ines are as authentic as possible. Some scenes were so funny that i basically cried tears of joy. Especially the nude party is so ridiculous ... its actually one of best scenes i ever saw in cinema.

This is a great and very unique movie and i want to thank Maren Ade for this piece of art. Imho the best German comedy ever made. 10/10

How could they make such a good film out of "Toni Erdmann"? The premise seems worn-out: Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek), a retired music teacher, assumes the fake identity of Toni Erdmann by putting on grotesque fake teeth whenever he feels like horsing around with people, which is quite often. He comes to visit his daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller), a tough businesswoman who lives in Bucharest, and messes up her life. The trailer gave reason to expect a movie with more instances of Fremdschämen - external shame - than comedy. And I took it for granted that all this would lead to a "heartwarming" change of the daughter and her discovering what "living" really means.

But this comedy isn't about punchlines, and this tragedy isn't about payoffs. The actors are too clever to make caricatures out of their characters. Sandra Hüller in particular deserves praise for keeping a shade of humanity in the early scenes, and it actually makes her more creepy. Is her tolerably friendly behavior towards her father just as phoney as her smiles in business sessions? And writer-director Maria Ade shows us so much from the lives of her characters and takes the scenes to such lengths that cheap triumphs become impossible. Toni interferes in Ines' life when he tells tall tales to her clients or even introduces himself as the "German ambassador in Romania"; but ultimately, he doesn't overthrow, he only irritates. When Ines hosts a nude party at the end, it would play out like an act of liberation in any other film. Here, the most drastic consequence is a change of workplace: from one consulting company to the next.

No, Toni Erdmann cannot change the cold business world, which is a tragedy. But he remains stubborn and resistant in this world, and that is a blessing. Because the film takes time (162 minutes) to make you care for these characters and to introduce believable (if not realistic) situations, they provide some humor again. When Toni makes a slick businessman believe that he's hired a replacement daughter because his real child is too busy to spend time with him, you laugh that you may not cry.

Globalization is an important theme in "Toni Erdmann". Economic issues are addressed ("outsourcing"), but in the end the movie has more to say about cultural and societal alienation. Large parts of the dialogue are held in English even though, if I remember correctly, no native English speakers turn up; this adds to the shallowness of conversations. One can talk about business deals, bars and shopping facilities this way, but after a while, there may not be anything more to care about. The Romanians, by the way, never come off as stereotyped, whether it's an impulsive factory owner or a simple worker. For some reason, it is an absolute rarity in films - in Hollywood and elsewhere - to portray foreigners as human beings if they're not among the leads, but this is one of those instances.

The wisest films tend to ask questions instead of giving answers. Toni asks Ines the old, clichéd question, "Do you actually find the time to live?" She responds, "What is living?" Toni doesn't know. He tries to live his own way, but he can't tell others what to do, and the ending doesn't show us a revolution. Maria Ade knows what Brecht knew when he wrote,

"With consternation / We see the curtain closed, the plot unended. / In your opinion then, what's to be done?"

This is a great movie - but most likely not for everyone. It's about academic upper middle-class people and their family relationships. Not everybody will find that interesting and there is no usual "romantic" plot development. It's a family portrait of a father and her daughter and as such has no (plot) conclusion. It is not the usual light comedy since it touches very serious questions and the prevailing mood is unhappiness (it is however _very_ funny at times ;-)).

That being said, this movie makes some very fine and subtle observations, presents them in a funny and entertaining form yet at the same time in a thought-provoking and philosophical way which will make you think about it for a long time. If you're from an academic (german) household you will find lots of similarities in your own family relations.

This movie is not fast-paced - in fact it often has long shots of lonely people and a lot is not said but has to be filled in by the viewer. So if you don't relate to the characters this movie will feel longish for sure. But if you find traces of your own life or that of your friends and relatives you'll be amazed by the subtlety and finesse in which this movie is directed. Although there are some bizarre events, everything which happens in this movie could happen in real life. There are no implausible scenes in this movie! This is an incredible statement given the crazy and bizarre things which happen in this movie. If you wanna know how that could be true, you might wanna watch it.

This film is OK, but not outstanding. With a running time of 160 minutes it is far too long and some obviously boring scenes could have been shortened. There are a lot of irrational decisions by the protagonists. If they were funny they could aid the film. However, they aren't. What is funny about eating a sperm soaked petite four? The joke with the fake teeth is overstretched and redundant. Some jokes by the father have even to be declared as jokes by him otherwise nobody would have understood them. What is most ungratifying with this film is the lack of connection to the main character. He was so poorly introduced, I did not feel any sympathy with him. Some of his actions were meant to be funny but were so stupid I felt sorry for him. Even the end leaves you with a "so what?". The daughter keeps her unsatisfying type of job although at a different company and the relationship with her father seems to be just the same as before. Lucky for the daughter, her new job is much farther away from her fathers home. There is hope that he leaves her alone.

I watched this movie due to its high mark (especially by the meta-score)and in the last seconds I asked myself: so what ? Like we never saw solitude, loneliness movies ever...The acting is OK, but the subject is stretched over limits, and at a certain time I stopped to watch and went for a cigarette ! My understanding about this movie is about two societies with their characteristics (the German and the Roumanian) both mixed in a capitalistic globalization, I won't say without mercy but without care for real people. Perhaps the last or one of the last sentences of the father was that we work all time to accomplish some targets (typically German !) and don't pay attention to details along our life and then is too late....As a Romanian born young person, the atmosphere of Bucarest is very well depicted as well people surrounding the personages. But one shouldn't wonder, as these days the Romanian cinema is among the highest in its achievements, for example Mungiu's recent film "Bacalaureat" (aka Graduation)stands much above the present one. Sorry folks, but I wasn't left with a great impression.

Maren Ade has created an opus which may be regarded as a universal comment on our global system where everything seems to be fine as long as economical progress is ongoing. However, we should not forget that pure progress induces dark sides as well.

"Toni Erdmann" has a great screenplay. Basically, it tells a father-daughter-story, but every sign of empathy seems to be frozen. Ines Conradi (Sandra Hüller) shows a great performance as she already did in "Amour Fou". She only lives for working and does not care much about family or emotional matters. All that counts is the progress of her career. Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek) interprets a loving father who only wants to spend some time with his daughter. As Ines facade cannot be broken, he starts disturbing her perfect world of rules and manners by becoming Toni Erdmann.

The screenplay does not contain many big plot points but convinces the viewer by the development of its great characters and the intelligent and often embarrassing dialogues. The audience is trapped by the society rules of this business world. Consequently, we are feeling with Ines who is more and more irritated by her father  now transformed to Toni Erdmann. He starts to shatter the stability of the system by his strange, unconventional character and jokes. The dialogues with excellent acting are so trenchant that moments of great humor are coming up.

Everybody of the business world looks strangely at Toni Erdmann when he appears but we start thinking about who is weird and crazy in reality. Is it Toni Erdmann as he is not behaving like everybody else would expect of a supposed business man? Or is it this whole community of economists which takes drugs and which feigns emotions? Maybe Eugène Ionesco can help us to find an answer. 

The film itself, most of the time taking place in Romania, only rarely shows poor people as one would assume. Most of the time we just hear about the problems of a German enterprise which has to do some outsourcing. In many scenes we can see that Ines does not really care about the people around her. She is just a representative person of the company and keeps distance. Her father, on the other hand, does not care about society rules and is able to communicate in a simple, affective way with the people of this country.

Gradually Ines is influenced by the spirit of life and the philosophy of her father as she gradually throws off her mask. What does it mean to have a life where one does not have any emotional link to his colleagues? What does it mean to see progress only but to forget that man is a social being? Even when Ines is in front of her secret lover and colleague Tim, she is not able to show any emotions.

With Patrick Orth, director Maren Ade creates a light visual style which is ideally coordinated with the actor's play. We are in a world where we cannot foresee what happens next. When Toni Erdmann appears, everything seems to start trembling. The stability of our conformist and capitalistic system is threatened by the presence of only one "strange" character.

The sexual violation of a plate of petits fours is one of several scenes in the too lengthy, sluggishly paced "Toni Erdmann" that attempts to repulse a long suffering audience into a sympathy for the main character's banal perversity in her dreary corporate schemes. It's a shamefully manipulative device that brings no visionary edge or joy of whimsy to reward us for our trouble. True believers of the aesthetic collective this movie serves may accuse us naysayers of having sanctimonious eyes, but it's simply a viewer's humble craving to engage a narrative without being toyed with like those dainty pastel pastries. The stellar reviews of this movie by the "cognoscenti" are mystifying, and some professional reviewers are intimidated to contest this group-think. I actually watched one reviewer in a panel understandably assert a spirited negative review only to immediately second-guess himself. He absurdly conceded that he'll watch the movie one more time in the presence of an audience as opposed to being a misguidedly lone viewer, and perhaps that would sweeten his view of it.

I liked this movie a lot. I met "these" people over the last 25 years in Bucharest and in Germany.

In this "new global world", the most of the time everybody is so deep into the details of "knowing how to be" because everybody is already like this, that if you take a step back and watch from a different angle you might wonder if anyone still remembers what it is to be a human. To remember the pleasure of feeling secure and loved by the ones that are guaranteed to be the ones that will do so. And finally if you get the right angle, you have to admit that everyone around you looks ridiculously, trying to find the detail in the detail that would make a difference, even if everybody does everything identically and there is obviously nothing else. The game about being a tough global business-woman/man, up to the most disgusting proofs to be the tougher one, is finally just flat and meaningless.

The whole story is wonderful true. The actors are doing a fantastic job making you feel the frustration and discomfort that should be seen and felt by everyone living in such a world. It is not a slow movie ... it is the shortest version of an never-ending slow life with nothing that would make your heart pound for the true meanings.

This movie brought two points to my mind. Einstein defined madness: - Trying the same thing again and again while expecting a different outcome. - Google was build on the simple idea that everybody is searching for something that everybody is already mentioning... Try to type "Apple" in the Google search field

Watching this movie feels like standing in a cool, empty room and looking at a piece of abstract modern art. It's bizarre, disturbing and confusing. You can try to analyse, what the filmmakers intentions were or what may symbolise something, if you like doing that. The most obvious message of the movie (spend more time with your family) appears quite trivial. Some parts are somewhat funny because of the extreme absurdness of the events (don't expect subtlety). The laughter, however, mostly sticks in your throat. The characters are hard to understand, let alone identify with. There are a lot of silent moments, in which you get the chance to feel into the characters, only you don't feel much more than awkwardness. If you're looking for entertainment or something to take from it, I recommend you don't watch this film. If you like "art projects", naked people or unorthodox film making, it may be of interest.

Maybe I have read to many positive reviews about Toni Erdmann (btw. "Toni Erdmann" would be a wonderful brand name for fashion products like sun glasses). And my expectations went too high. Because, the movie does not fulfill the highest praise written by all of the professional reviewers. This is a low emotion movie. I guess, it depends mainly on the viewer, how involved he/she will get. Simonischek as father and Hüller as daughter play wonderful, giving the characters an authentic drive. Somehow Hüller's acting calls to mind the well tempered acting of Jodie Foster! In the movie the daughter is captured in the slippery profession of a top management consultant in East Europe. After the death of his old dog her father visits her for several weeks and tries to give her back some real life by making himself a fool to show all other are fools, too. His trick works out quite successful and shows surprisingly believable that individuals got much wider possibilities to act in real life to change the world, as they do in daily life by just following their little cushy habits instead. Just go for this movie. It is entertaining and it will give you some hints what is going wrong in/with your life. (and will go on wrong in future...).

I feel amazed (and sorry) for the critics and their praises. How narrow a filmviewing horizon they must possess. The premise of the film has been dealt with many times before with flair and originality and this is not one of those instances. Referencing Von Trier for validation, offers more comedic value than the film itself can muster - after all it is being presented as a comedy. You will read about character development and cinematography and narration in excess. The truth is there hardly no character development in sight (emotional outbursts don't count as such, merely as a character snapshot if you will), below par cinematography (following protagonists with a handy is not the archetype of masterful camera-work or framesetting), a narrative that is neither resourceful nor original, which coupled with an entire editing room on strike results in a near 3 hour experience at which any German would exclaim "da ham wir den Salat". The acting is good and therefore I'm not slamming it completely to the ground, but if you want to see something European towards that direction try Cantet's 'L' emploi du temps' instead.

I love films , so I had to go watch one of the most talked about films of 2016 with all this fuss and awards going on about it.

As other IMDBers have already mentioned, the expectations were high enough , and I sort of demanded a good film. I cannot say I got that.

The story (which isn't really a story) roughly, is about a woman whose job is basically firing people off of other companies --- and her father who is bizarrely present and around her throughout most of the film , making awkward but somewhat distant jokes , supposedly to help her have a better life.

Toni Erdmann is a bizarre film for sure. Nothing wrong with that, just stating a fact. It's a film that shows us instead of telling us things. Which is respectful, elegant and admirable in a way and that's a plus for Maren Ade.

There are admirable things in Toni Erdmann , but for me there are also big flaws that reduced the overall viewing experience.

The fatal flaw to name, is the starkness and the extreme cold atmosphere of this film and all its characters. For me a film must offer entertainment , in the broad sense. Meaning that a film has to give us a variety of good things that'll "warm us". Good soundtrack , interesting and empathizing characters , a good atmosphere and locations , and of course a solid story that'll surround us and in the end win us with its charm so we'll want to re watch the film after it starts to rust in our memory.

I don't want to watch Toni Erdmann again. There was no charm that won me and so just one preview is enough. I didn't connect with the characters much , not that I don't have common things ,most of us get modern life's problems , and we have common issues with fiction characters who aren't too happy with their life. Its a safe bet. But this doesn't mean you connect with the characters as well.

Toni Erdmann felt very much like you are inside a fridge, sitting in there and viewing stuff in a cold environment. Too cold. Also it runs too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes for the particular story told. For the kind of praise it got , I expected better characters , better dialogues and in the whole a better picture.

The direction in its practical sense of camera placement and movement was mediocre and so was the photography which was pretty basic so don't expect "good pictures".

The admirable things about it, was the good acting, mostly by the father "Toni" but the daughter was modestly good as well in her role. The originality of the film's approach to the father-daughter relationship was another good thing. And lastly the film's themes and questions/problems addressed by the director/scriptwriter Maren Ade. The story had meaning behind it sure, but it was too elegant about those themes (the corporate world vs human values and what matters for modern man vs what should really matter.) These are honorable themes and Maren Ade seems like a decent person to explore and show us a few troubling things in the hope to awaken us, but as a film it was mediocre. Of course that's just my opinion, but I have to say there are some rules in Film making , and mrs Ade neglected a few of them.

The film is (partly) about the fact that the globalisation of production does not go hand in hand with the globalisation of (real) culture, and therefore people lose a part of their "humanness", and get a strange substitute for it, the so-called "corporate culture". This problem affects all of us and most of us must have encountered similar situations or feelings as the persons in the film, that is why imho it resonates with so many people. It is especially meaningful coming from a nation, which in the past produced the greatest artists and thinkers (and not only the dark years), and which by all its peculiar characteristics and abilities would be meant to oppose the above trend. Sorry if my English is a bit strange.

So the summary seemed great. Too bad this was nowhere in the movie. How does this movie show the struggle of the father trying to recconect with his daughter? Other than being an immature middle-aged man, he does nothing but ruin his daughter's business connections, her meetings and the job she had so carefully fought for, by appearing EVERYWHERE and lying to everyone. The business scenes were way too many and way too tiring, but served as the only normal scenes in the film. Other than that, total chaos. By the end of the film we realise how damaged, lonely and obsessed the daughter is with her career. The acting was excellent though, even by the supporting actors, plus a few moments seemed so delicately designed.

Watching this movie, and knowing that the critics have put it very well and very comical, I think I must have a very rare sense of humor. What has produced me the most is shame. Family is a very special issue, we agree. The fact that you want your daughter or any other member of the family to have more life, enjoy life and not devote so much to work, is very well and indeed we have seen in countless films. But to do as this father does, it seems a bit unpleasant to say it well.

Is not it easier, to take advantage of the few free moments to prepare different things? I think that anyone who lives in such situations would be very angry. Work or working life is such a very important part of people's lives that it can occupy much more than a third of your life.

The amount of trouble I could have gotten her daughter, I thought was too much. And seeing all the companions laughing at the father, I felt sorry for her.

The film has become long, long. I could have put more sequences of more moments of the negotiation, the truth I do not know if they needed? See how the woman tells the father, who knew he was not the ambassador, unfortunate.

The actors are very good, too bad that the wrong way.

The photograph seems very ugly, there were moments that I thought to put on sunglasses.

The address, I have already commented, simple and without direction, simple planes, and does not know that it is long.

The case is that the movie I believe it, I think I'm watching a story, but I find everything so disgusting, it does not help me.

Spoiler:

See how the woman tells the father, who knew he was not the ambassador, unfortunate.

That if I must say that the part of the final party, naked, is well thought out. The character of the woman is doing very well, not admitting that she has not had time to prepare and the excuse is nudity, but it would be as simple as asking for a minute, putting on a robe and then getting dressed, she is at home .

When Peter Simonischek's ancient dog dies, he has a breakdown and flies to Rumania to expend his existential crisis upon his daughter, Sandra Hüller. Were this a 70-minute movie, it might be quirky and eccentric, with some Important Message about Enjoying the Moment. However, it is not 70 minutes. It is 160 minutes, and so Herr Simonischek spends about two and a half hours tormenting his daughter -- and the audience -- until she has her own nervous breakdown and existential crisis.

How was this movie nominated for Best Foreign Movie? Did watching it cause an existential crisis, or is it that half the dialogue is in English, which must impress the largely Anglophone Academy? Also there are some quirky moments scattered through the movie; about five, making up almost a minute of its length. The rest of the jokes are neither numerous nor worth offering.

How do I know? Because these are the sort of jokes I would make. I would test them out on my cousin or one or two friends in a deadpan fashion. Take the joke the hero does about how his daughter is never there and even when she is, she is on the phone. Therefore, the joke goes, he has hired a young woman to play his daughter and clip his toe nails. My in-house testing -- so to speak -- would yield a result from a grunt (the worst rating, acknowledging it), to a question about how well she clips toe nails (the best rating). This would rate a grunt and so would be abandoned. Only the best rated jokes go into my repertoire. Not so in this movie.

As I indicated, at 70 minutes, this might have made a light, almost Tati-esque movie. At two hours and forty minutes, though, it is so Teutonic in its exhaustive detail that all I can do is marvel at its stultifying length.

There's just something really magical about this film. I had heard so much praise bestowed upon it but had never really read anything about its premise or plot. I found it to be a very lovely, touching, and brilliant drama, although it also functions as a comedy in more ways than one. I think the real gift of the film is that it's able to be so touching and charming without actually trying to be overly cute and sentimental. The screenplay does so many things and takes so many turns for us to keep on going on this ride with the lead characters. Peter Simonischek and especially Sandra Huller are really fantastic and give us here one of the best pairings of 2016. This is a film to cherish and adore and I really hope it finds an audience. I'm sure it will and I can't wait to see it again.

What a great experience this film was. This different story is based on family relationships, and explores these at a deep level. In this great movie, it is about the relationship between father and daughter. Two very different personalities who strive to create a better relationship with each other. I will not reveal anything except that as with any difficult family relationships, so it can be both demanding and tough. This movie is long, and has been criticized for it. But not by me. Every scene is important, and the movie never gets boring or tedious. The story develops. One of the best things about the film is that it is unpredictable, that the characters will surprise and amaze. Lovely to see and experience. I would also like to highlight the wonderful role performance. I just need to see more German film after this, there is no doubt. Recommend this. One of the best from 2016.

As far as Contradictions In Terms go German Humour has to be in the Top One so that on paper a film being sold as a German comedy has a built- in audience of sceptics from the start. The main question is, of course, can it deliver? Can it confound the cynics and show the world that the Master Race is not such a disaster race in terms of belly laughs. The answer is a definite maybe with the audience still out. Speaking for myself I didn't laugh once and doubt if I even smiled but then I have always preferred verbal to physical humour, the sad sack in a gorilla costume is a bad nowhere in my book to a Neil Simon one-liner so this entry had a mountain to climb from Frame one.

Deeply odd, often painfully funny, sometimes just painful (in the good, emotional way), and often all 3 at once. 

A character study of an eccentric father trying to re-connect with his very straight laced adult daughter doesn't sound like it would be nearly as unique as this wildly idiosyncratic film. But Ade (who is terribly under known in the U.S. for her two excellent earlier features "The Forrest for the Trees" and "Everyone Else") manages to keep us delightfully (if sometimes very uncomfortably) off-balance for over two and a half hours as her film and characters resolutely refuse to go where we might expect from other stories with similar themes.

I loved the way Ade explains nothing. There is almost no expository dialog in the whole film. It's up to us to figure out relationships, the past, motives, emotions, sanity vs. madness, even simply what the hell is going on at that moment by really watching the behavioral details of some wonderful performances (especially by her two leads). While the film could perhaps have been trimmed a bit, and not every scene works as well as the best, it's without doubt one of my very favorite films of 2016. 

I'm old enough and have seen enough movies that when a film-maker can give me an experience unlike any other I've had with a film before I'm thrilled. And that's what Ade does with this heartbreaking comedy. If forced to describe it with a gun to my head, maybe the best I could come up with for the tone and feel would be "Harold and Maude" as made by Ingmar Bergman. :-)

Germans don't have a reputation for being extremely funny. In cinema, they are better known for their dramas than for their comedies. 'Toni Erdmann' is the exception to the rule. It's a German comedy and - surprise! - it has funny moments.

On the other hand, this film is as much a drama as a comedy. The focus is not so much on the humor, but rather on the relationship between a father and his daughter. The daughter is a tense career woman, who lives in Bucharest and doesn't really seem to enjoy her life. When her father visits her, he tries to make her unwind a bit by performing crazy pranks and practical jokes. It's because of these jokes, sometimes leading to hilarious situations, that the film is classified as a comedy. But on the other hand, there is always a bitter aftertaste to the humour, because it is secondary to the father-daughter theme.

As irritating and embarrassing the father sometimes is to the daughter, at last he succeeds in changing her attitude. This in itself leads to some bizarre and also dramatically strong scenes.

In my opinion, the script could have used some streamlining and there was no need to stretch the movie to 162 minutes. On the plus side: this film offers an original view to the question how seriously we should take life. And the two lead actors do a great job.

It had problems with pace. It was slow. It has as a central character a sullen, forlorn, unlikable and very unsympathetic young woman. The male lead, the woman's father performed largely comic relief. None of the characters seemed to properly developed as to why they were on a particular path. 

Some of the minor characters were even on the good side but some vital plot points were not expressed in a manner that leads the audience to identify with the characters journeys. 

I think that it might have had many editing problems and pieces of plot left on the cutting room floor.

I was deeply moved by this movie. It shows a spark of comedy in a tragic life. The life that is driven by mere ambitions. And I observe this in real life where people become so distant from each another. If they cannot be an asset, they are useless, they are distraction.

We see so often that people/my friends strive to be successful and spend their time of everything else but their family. Especially, parents. 'I don't have time' becomes a slogan of this generation. They visit family members when they are sick or dying or it's too late. This time is not about enjoying the moment. This time seems about chasing something. Chasing nothing.

In this film Toni perfectly reveals the absurdity of his daughter's life that is based on illusions as we see that the daughter is suffering behind her successful mask because she cannot get close to anyone. This contrast between the father and the daughter is seen through all the film. He is emotional and thinks about individuals. She is cold, distant and feels shame about her father. But in this film the father is the one who makes sense though he acts like a clown all the time. He makes all this high society look like a bunch of idiots with their small talks and false images. And I loved it.

I enjoyed the unexpected moments of this film and the set they used. Romania is an amazing country and a wonderful choice. Credibility was nicely caught. Many episodes were amazing and revealed the fragments of Romanian culture.

Actually, I waited for a movie like this and for more films that reveal the false values of our lives. Acting is great! It's a must see!

So what's the point of the two most outrageous scenes in Toni Erdmann? 

In the first, Ines turns a tryst with Tim into her watching him masturbate onto a  green, she specifies  petit-four which she then eats. Finger-licking good. In the second, she decides at the last minute to answer the door naked and require all her friends and work colleagues to strip down if they want to stay for her Sunday birthday brunch. 

First, both her actions are outrageous. That means she's adopting the manic absurdity of her father, a compulsive practical joker who has donned looney wig and fake teeth to pass as her CEO's life coach, "Toni Erdmann." Within that liberation she's stripping off false appearances. The service Ines is trying to sell the Bucharest international is explicitly deception, finding a false front for the company's inhumane conduct in a merger. 

In the first outrageous scene, a romantic tryst is exposed as not having any romance at all. Ines's Tim is a junior colleague, excluded from key meetings, an attractive callow young man whom she is sexually using  like a confection. By watching him masturbate she admits her detachment from him even in their normal intercourse. Instead of their usual pretence at "making love" she is literally using him as a delectable to appease her appetite. Her choice of green pastry may be a nod at her eco consciousness  or a reminder that he is that callow junior, green in judgment. 

The second episode has her stripping all the veneers of her corporate image including the smart dress that is the social equivalent to her business uniform. The dress she is trying to change at the last minute is too tight to serve. Her father's crazy intervention has revived her own spontaneous spirit  first seen when she responds to his insistence she sing. The too- tight dress reminds her that her professional career, responsibilities, efficiency, pretences, are all restricting her essential impulses and character. The team-building use of her birthday then tests her friends' and colleagues' willingness to take her on her own terms. Her nakedness also confronts them with the sexism clearly revealed in her boss and male clients.

So Winfried turns out in fact to be a life coach, if only hers. He is returning his daughter to the free spirit she has suppressed for corporate purposes. He's reviving her individuality and enjoyment of life. He tries to affect the others he meets as well, like the impoverished worker whose side he takes against the corporate expansion with its murderous layoffs, the worker he tries to save from firing, the family gathering he spikes with song. 

Winfried's very appearance in her life cracks her efficiency and stability. The distraction puts her off her focus. When she catches her foot on the sofa bed she's making up for him, the bruise swells up and later spatters her white blouse with blood, just before a presentation. It's a defloration image, an emblem of her penetration and new consciousness. It sets up the two sexual scenes we're considering. 

The idea of a two and half-hour German comedy may seem surprising. But the acerbic view of corporate character and strategies and the extremity of the father's and daughter's behaviour provide the Brechtian dynamic of social criticism and critical detachment (Verfremdunkseffekt). 

"Erdmann" has two other European forbears: Renoir's Boudu, a vagrant who disrupts the family and life of the bourgeois bookseller who "saves" him from drowning, and the Czech Josef Hasek's Good Soldier Schweik whose fumbling and possibly deliberate  or not  incompetence destroys the organizational structures and formalities around him. 

In setting German characters in a Rumanian situation director Ms Maren Ade may be reflecting on her nation's outreach into the EU. Winfried evokes a German folk figure unleashed upon the international sophisticates  and firmly unabashed. This German will remain proudly Germanic  especially manic  in whatever cosmopolitan situation he finds himself. And he will violate every decorum to return his daughter to her freer potential as well. Significantly, once liberated from her Bucharest company Ines doesn't return to Germany but takes her show on the road to Singapore.
