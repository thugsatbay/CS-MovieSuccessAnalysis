### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Although the movie is predictable, like most romance comedies are, nevertheless it was sweet. Sure a bit unrealistic in terms of the time line of the whole plot takes place but this is why we have movies like this, so you can escape into the fantasy of romance and humor. If you are looking for realism then watch a 3 hour drama, but if you want to escape for awhile and just enjoy a movie you don't have to think too much about then it's worth your time. If you don't want to pay to go see it in the theater, then wait for it to come out on DVD. I saw it during a private screening as part of the ATL Film Festival, for close to two hours I thought of nothing else and laughed and even cried a bit. I would definitely see it again. It may not be the best romantic comedy I have seen but the movie still holds lots of charm.

Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.

The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.

I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.

The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.

BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.

The Proposal isn't going to win any Oscars, nor will it become your favourite movie of all time. However, it does exactly what it is supposed to do; that is to entertain you. The Proposal is the story of a tough editor Margaret Tate (Bullock) who forces her assistant Andrew Tate (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the U.S. (Interestingly, in the movie Bullock plays a Canadian and Reynolds an American while in real life, the reverse is true). What happens next will not surprise viewers but they will get many laughs along the way. Reynolds and Bullocks are very funny and also very believable. Betty White (from the Golden Girls) almost steals the show as Andrew's 90 year old "Gammy". The beautiful Alaskan setting doesn't hurt things either. Overall this is not a unique movie or even a unique role for Bullock but it is a very funny (and fun) way to spend an afternoon.

We went into this movie more or less out of despair; the cinema offerings seemed uniformly lousy and we simply wanted to see a movie that looked like fun. This one looked stupid: I'd seen Betty White promoting the movie on Jimmy Fallon's show and the scene shown was idiotic, though it did have a couple of amusing lines. Well, we were all pleasantly surprised. The outcome of the plot might be predictable, but the road getting there is surprisingly sharp and entertaining. There are quite a few witty lines and exchanges, and the delivery and timing of the two stars and, of course, of Betty White are just about perfect. Both of the lead characters have surprises in their backgrounds to reveal, and the settings are beautiful. There are one or two scenes that are clunkers, but even the dopey episode with White's Grandma Annie doing a ritualistic dance in the woods ends up having some relevance to a later plot event. The movie is well thought-out and well executed, and the actors create characters who engage us, even if we don't know anyone quite like them in our own lives.

Producer/star Sandra Bullock turns out what looks like another box office smash. Typical of most "chick-flicks," the trailer tells you just about everything you're going to see. Unexpectedly, though, the surprises come from behind the scenes. The film looks gorgeous (and not just the two lead actors): the prettiness of the interior sets is matched by the choice of locations. While much of the film is set amidst the beauty of a seaside town in Alaska, even New York City is made to look like something out of a story book. It hasn't looked this good since the era of Doris Day. Typical of such a film, the costumes, even on the extras in the background, are so well-coordinated with the locations that the whole thing feels like a "realist fantasy." 

Likewise, the plot itself is reminiscent of the romantic comedies of half a century ago - complete with their morality, albeit updated enough in a post-feminist era for Ryan Reynolds' masculinity to function credibly in "the Doris Day role." This he handles extremely well, although Sandra Bullock deserves most of the praise. As a producer, she knows her on- screen strengths and weaknesses, and, most importantly, she knows her audience and, despite the hard-nosed ice-queen she chooses to play here, everyone will continue to love her. Frankly, I was surprised to see so many empty seats at the sneak-preview last night in Boston, but I hope that doesn't get the filmmakers down. The audience loved this film and it's going to get positive word-of-mouth from whoever sees it - young or old. It's going to be around for a long time.

My jaw is still aching, almost an hour and a half after the credits rolled. I don't recall when I last laughed this consistently and heartfelt at a new production. Yes, this is pretty formulaic stuff... if you've seen one mismatched couple romantic comedy, you've seen them all. This never claimed to be anything other than that. It definitely delivers what one expects from the genre, without any of it being phoned in or taken any less seriously. Not every film needs to revolutionize the craft, and shape cinema for decades to come. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. And I find it incredible and immensely positive that a movie with this kind of humor(observational, and largely derived from typical situations that happen to everyone) can still be made, and be nicely received. Humiliation and pain are not actually funny. They get a schadenfreude reaction, "thank goodness that didn't happen to me", and thus we move further apart, isolate ourselves all the more. This does the opposite, letting us get closer to each other, share the little things that we've forgotten are silly or "off" in our everyday lives. It does go a tad too far on occasion, to get the audience going, but those instances are few in number. The acting is great all-round, and the two leads have chemistry, and play off each other well. There are countless memorable sequences, jokes and gags in this. This contains "moments" between Bullock and Reynolds, as well, and they genuinely work. You feel for them. The characters are just about invariably well-written, interesting and credible. In general, the script is well-done. The music is pleasant and well-chosen. This ought to entertain nearly everyone, of any age. There is a little strong and/or risqu√© language, and a couple of usually mild sexual references, and this tends to be inoffensive. I recommend this to all who think they may enjoy it. Chances are that you're right. 8/10

The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as "reality," this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.

It's not just that the assistant would probably be gay, or a young woman, as are Meryl Streep's in The Devil Wears Prada. Well, yes, it is, in a way. The author of the Prada book had worked for Anna Wintour. This ill-conceived book editor is feared by everyone on the floor just like the editor of Vogue. But although she seems ready to fire anyone she doesn't like, she does nothing but read unsolicited manuscripts while riding an exercise bike and coax well-known authors into doing Oprah. Her assistant, who presumably takes care of everything else, is an aspiring writer and editor, but he still looks like a guy who spends most of his time at the gym.

The standard Forties material -- sparring guy-and-gal fall in love -- has to stand the test of 21st-century role-reversals, boss-lady, servile man. But the real problem is the serious lack of chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. This is role for Katharine Hepburn, who could be imperious, overbearing, elegant, but very feminine. If only Ryan Reynolds were Cary Grant, but needless to say, he isn't. He's not suave, merely fresh and pleasant. The best you can say for him is that despite his bulky muscles he looks okay in a suit. The wardrobe department are the unsung heroes of this film. But it's not that Reynolds or Bullock does bad work, just that the writing sucks.

The movie doesn't manage to establish Margaret's dominance or Andrew's competence before the plot gets its sendoff. Instead, off they go to Alaska to meet his family on a weekend when the Paxtons plan to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White). Clearly, Andrew realizes he now has the upper hand. Margaret threatens to fire him if he doesn't cooperate, but she has more to lose. And so he sets out to make her experience in Alaska hell.

But the new venue takes over and the comedy gets lost in the surprises Andrew's family offers. The Paxtons turn out to be by far the richest people in the remote town of Sitka (no, not Sitcom). This is the lazy way to handle the situation, so long as the filmmakers have the budget for it, which they do: poshness is so generic, so Hollywood. On hand are Craig T. Nelson from The Family Stone and Mary Mary Steenburgen from a couple more raucous but equally bad family comedies, 'Step Brothers' and 'Four Christmases.' And veteran Betty White, whose energy at 87 is admirable, but whose eccentric old lady role is annoying and cloying.

Anne Fletcher lacks inventiveness and finesse in staging the standard situations. When Andrew has to jump into bed with Margaret in the morning when mom brings in breakfast (the Paxtons are rich, but they still do all the work in their mansion, except at party time), the sequence is drawn-out and unfunny. When the still-unfriendly couple accidentally fall on top of each other while naked, it's more clunky than cute: they're like big icky wet statues. It's better not even to talk about the omnipresent Ramone, played by Oscar Nu√±ez of "The Office," who apparently somebody thinks is funny enough to be a waiter, a general store manager, an erotic dancer, and the minister for a wedding ceremony. The erotic dancer part is excruciating. Only in Sitka, not, hopefully, in any other movie. Did the filmmakers bring in an actor from "The Office" to make up for how poorly they developed the office scenes earlier in the movie? 

Oh yes, and there's other fun stuff like an eagle chasing a puppy and then flying off with Margaret's cell phone instead; Betty White chanting around a fire with a rug; Betty Steenbergen looking harried; and Craig T. Nelson driving biodegradable golf balls into the bay. When the two would-be lovebirds return to New York and tell the immigration officer they're in love for real now and willing to undergo his scrutiny, he says "Let's do it!" 

Let's not.

My best friend, God, I love her, we've been friends for 10 years, she's been there for me through everything as I've been there for her, I would crawl through broken glass to get her a birthday gift¬Ö wait, that doesn't sound so healthy. But I do love the girl, however, what the heck did I do to her to be punished this badly when she begged me to see The Proposal? See, I don't get it, we have a "romantic comedy" script, no one changes anything, just the actors, every clich√© in the book and somehow people fall for it. There is a needle in a haystack when it comes to a romantic comedy being actually funny or entertaining, but with the positive reviews that the IMDb users had been writing, I was actually thinking maybe this might be a good movie¬Ö YOU IMDb USERS, how dare you?! Shame on you that you fell for it once again, I'm going to point out how my puppy could have written this script after I tell you the story, even though I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.

Margaret Tate is the executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company, Colden Books. All of her workers, including her assistant Andrew Paxton hate her, and she fires a senior editor, Bob Spaulding. After learning she is being deported to Canada, she forces Andrew to marry her, as his future is tied to hers. When the government investigates, Mr. Gilbertson informs them that they will undergo rigorous testing to prove that the marriage is not fraudulent. Andrew grudgingly accepts, under the condition that he is promoted to the position of editor and his manuscript be published. The two are forced to spend the weekend with his parents in Alaska in order to sell the lie. Margaret is very unreceptive of Alaska, and is shocked to learn that Andrew's family owns most of the business in Sitka. Andrew announces that he and Margaret are getting married. But as most romantic comedies, we know where this is all going as Margaret realizes the true value of family and Andrew realizes that Margaret is human as well, blah, blah, blah.

So tell me how in the heck is this original or funny? For God's sake we even have the clich√©d run to the airport before the girl leaves. The big kiss in front of a huge crowd that starts the slow clap. The crazy family that break down the "emotionless" woman into making her think that they're wonderful when really they all belong in a mental institution. The only thing The Proposal was missing was the clich√©d gay best friend or the bitter best girl friend! You have to understand, I try, I mean I really really tried to be nice and enjoy the movie for what it was, but how can I when I know exactly what they are going to say or what would happen next? How is it that in every romantic comedy the most opposite of people who brutally hated each other then all of a sudden fall in love in less then 2 days?! Why?! How?! You IMDb users who marked this movie as a 10, don't ever talk to me, I'm going to have a hard enough time having to forgive my best friend for doing this to me as she won't stop saying "Oh, my God! That was the sweetest movie ever!".

This is yet another predictable romantic comedy. The only difference is that Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make it tolerable, and even a little entertaining. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, a servant to Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). They hate each other. But when Margaret figures out she's being deported since she's not an American citizen she turns to Andrew. They say they are getting married. Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White, the best part of the film) is turning 90, so they go to Alaska, where Annie and Andrew's parents live. We then enter the clich√© parents. Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his wacky mother, and Joe (Craig T. Nelson), his uptight dad. This is not very entertaining. The laughs mostly come from Ryan Reynolds' calm personality. He just has a way of making me entertained. There's also Oscar Nunez, who plays Oscar on TV's The Office, playing Ramone. He will remind you of an aspect of Local Hero. This is not a good movie, but it might just be worth renting just for the mild entertainment. On second thought, you can just skip it.

Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one.

Sandy's attempting a Miranda Priestly-type character (Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada) which doesn't actually suit her acting style very well, but when you get used to her she's fun to watch. And she has great comic timing. So does Ryan Reynolds for that matter, who has a way of just looking perplexed that can make you snicker.

The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clich√©s and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.

Bullock and Reynolds ooze charisma in all scenarios here, and their chemistry is what anchors the film firmly in watchability, even elevating the film at times to outright excellence. And to The Proposal's credit for every clich√© it puts forth, we often get a quick rebuttal of charm, but which ultimately asks the question, why in the first place? I am almost tempted to follow in critic gene Siskel's footsteps and swear off watching movie trailers, because all the best line are in the promotional material; I don't mean they are the only good lines, simply that they would have made the film even more enjoyable had they been fresh. Directed by Anne Fletcher, who has already had rom-com success with Step Up and 27 Dresses, takes a chance with Bullock in my opinion as most would have good with a younger, hot-at-the-moment star. She does not disappoint and in her role as boss, Bullock is certainly suited; imagine that, a character that looks their supposed age.

The plot is certainly one of contrivance, as are with most romantic comedies today, with the stern manger of a publishing firm (Bullock) essentially blackmailing her younger assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into marrying her so she can save herself from deportation and stay in the U.S. It just so happens of course, that it is Andrew's grandmother's birthday that very weekend and is heading up to Alaska for the celebration. Trapped in secluded north, will this faux engagement become something real? The worst scenes of the film take place in the office, with the underlings of the tyrannical boss quite literally diving for cover upon her arrival. We have surely seen in films like Office Space and The Devil Wears Prada that a work scenario can combine humour with realism without the need for the employees to act like Looney Toones characters. My first impression of the time frame in which evil over bearer and ambitious assistant fall in love was that of annoyance as such feelings would never form so quickly. However I may have initially judged too harshly, as is nicely illustrated, Andrew and Margaret only have each other. Andrew is ambitious and loyal, knowing everything about Margaret, and in turn Margaret is so dedicated to her job without any semblance of a personal life, he is her only true confidante and slowly the scenario becomes slightly less preposterous.

The Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and the supporting cast including the delightful Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson make for a well rounded and talented cast. My absolute favourite member, which perhaps not coincidently my favourite part of the film, is Malin Akerman as an old flame of Andrew's. It was so refreshing to see an ex portrayed as a nice, honest human being instead of a vengeful witch and it is these intermittent moments of true human emotion that wouldn't make me turn this film off if I happened by it again; even if I wouldn't seek it out on my own accord.

Okay, I had been really excited to see The Proposal ever since it came out. I was hyping it up a lot when I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but I just love Sandra Bullock and Betty White and couldn't wait to get my hands on this film! When I did, it definitely lived up to my expectations.

The thing with The Proposal was you could predict the ending and predict some events that would be happening throughout the film and some of the main problems were clich√©, but I wasn't basing my opinions on this movie to be,"Is it going to be predictable, because if it is, I won't like it!" No, I wasn't like that, because I knew this film was going to be predictable here and there, but I was looking to see if they made it enjoyable and at least brought some fresh, new material to the table, which they certainly did that! I thought some scenes were just so wonderfully done and the whole movie itself was constructed perfectly for the type of movie that it is.

I had a really good time watching The Proposal and thought it was great entertainment with insanely lovable characters; I wanted to shriek with joy every time I saw Grandma Annie; a lot of incredibly humorous scenes at times, my favorites were when Margaret and Grandma Annie were dancing to the spirits which got the biggest laughs out of any part of the movie from me and when the dog was picked up by an eagle and Margaret was chasing it around trying to get her phone back; both hysterical, and some questionable, yet sweet and charming dialogue; Near the end in the office was cute and original, and the credits were funny as well with the dialogue in them. This movie while being clich√©, as I've stated many times, did still pack a very powerful punch and made me laugh, cry and enjoy it tremendously, so therefore it succeeded in what it was meant to do in the first place and that was to entertain. I loved it for the light-hearted, pleasant and fun comedy that it is....

Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's "The Devil Wears Prada", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's "While You Were Sleeping", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ing√©nue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher ("27 Dresses") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.

The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.

They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' "Crash" in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.

Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens ("The Mary Tyler Moore Show") and less like Rose Nylund ("The Golden Girls"). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman ("Watchmen") is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nu√±ez ("The Office") grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.

"The Proposal" has a stellar cast and a suicidal script. The script begins brilliantly: Margaret (Sandra Bullock) a master-of-the-universe publishing exec who also happens to be very beautiful, has a younger, very sexy assistant ¬ñ Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) ¬ñ whom she forces to marry her because her visa has expired and she's about to be deported. Sandra Bullock is fabulously, convincingly, hateful in her opening scenes. She makes the Meryl Streep character from "The Devil Wears Prada" look like a shar-pei puppy in comparison. You really want to see this character put through the wringer, that is, to grow and change in response to challenging events. Ryan Reynolds is, as ever, handsome, suave, understated, smart, and a very interesting actor. As buff as he is here, and he is very buff, (preparing for the lead in the next X-Man sequel) it's Reynolds' intelligence and acting chops that are most arresting. Reynolds is as good as the romantic comedy leads from the Golden Age; he just needs the right script to be part of a classic. The rest of the cast, with the exception of an obnoxious stripper who should have been left on the cutting room floor, is similarly brilliant: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Denis O'hare and especially Betty White are all solid professionals who've been fantastic in other movies.

There is so much promise here ¬ñ the pressures and pleasures of an older man and a younger woman; the erotic frisson of a woman boss and a hunky, male assistant, working with symbiotic intimacy over high-stakes projects, the blossoming of love in an impossible situation as two people who both love books get closer to each other, the changes a champion witch might go through as she falls in love. Andrew is given a hometown love interest, the young, blonde, Gertrude. Why did Andrew leave her and his hometown and move to New York City to work for an impossible person like Margaret? Because he loves books and literature and writing and the life of the mind, that's why. The movie could have given us ONE SCENE that showed Margaret and Andrew bonding over their love of literature ¬ñ and it didn't give us even that. What a horrible wasted opportunity. As discussion boards show, many viewers felt that there was no chemistry between Andrew and Margaret. That's all the fault of the script.

Rather than pursuing the potentially fascinating routes set up by the opening scene, the script takes a nosedive into the utterly crass. A sleazy Hispanic male stripper? Margaret confessing her faults in a way that unnecessarily compromises Andrew forever in the eyes of those who mean the most to him? Several false endings that spill over into the closing credit sequence? What's going on in Hollywood? Why can it produce game, top-notch actors who are also stars and not one coherent romantic comedy script since Norah Ephron?

A vanilla THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA meets an idiotic GREEN CARD.

Did Sandra Bullock learn nothing from her 1995 movie WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING? Here she goes again, blatantly lying about her supposed boyfriend to her supposed boyfriend's family, to cover an empty life of lovelessness.

Predictable? Check. Funny? Check. Cute little white dog named Kevin? Check. So we know what to expect from this crap going in. So what makes THE PROPOSAL so unbearable? The premise.

A hated editor-in-chief, Margaret (Sandra Bullock), blackmails her ambitious assistant, Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her so she can remain in America after her Canadian visa expires.

You lost me immediately: a person in Margaret's affluent position can afford lawyers to ensure that would never happen. On the common chance the startlingly inefficient Immigration and Naturalization Service does screw up paperwork (which they did for me!), she would - again - have her lawyers pummel them (like I did!), not tramp to the INS building and stand in line, or - now we're entering pure fantasy! - be granted an interview immediately with a - more fantasy - white, English-speaking officer (Denis O'Hare).

Taken as ignorant storytelling, we move forward. Andrew in turn blackmails Margaret for an editor's position or he won't help with her scam. We don't bother pointing out the thousand other legal options and loopholes in the plot, because by now it is obvious the characters are too dumb to take our advice anyway.

But let's get this straight for American muttonheads who believe that a "Resident Alien Card" (aka Green Card) process involves exams where you are quizzed like a schoolkid regarding which side of the bed you sleep on: there IS no such quiz! Take it from someone who suffered five years through the process: even if you're faking the marriage, an interview like the one Gerard Depardieu fails in GREEN CARD (1990) only involves parroting facts - the real horror of the Green Card process is the stark raving inefficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service itself. As Margaret correctly asserts, the INS only assign investigators to check on "terrorists, not book editors." Margaret and Andrew would have been lucky to get a Hispanic lackey who made them wait only four hours before mispronouncing their names calling their case. Instead, they get an officer who threatens to "check on them" at microbial levels, as if the INS has officers with that amount of time to waste. All they want is to ensure you insert yourself into the American economy, to generate income, to take it from you "legally" through taxes and other swinish practices.

The story takes Margaret out of her comfort zone of severe skirts and pumps so high her backside looks like a baboon in estrus, and plants the couple in Sitka, Alaska, to meet Andrew's parents. Though we know the filmmakers are trying to show Margaret's witch heart melting in this beautiful landscape, they only highlight more failings of the plot - the chemistry between Margaret and Andrew is non-existent and none of Andrew's family notice. His mother (radiant MILF, Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother (87-year-young Betty White) are so buoyant and welcoming, I don't have the heart to tell them they're in a bad romantic comedy.

They're portrayed to be such loving, stable people that they "accept" Margaret no matter her clinical coldness toward their son, who reciprocates with clinical coldness of his own. Either they're not mentioning the couple's detachment because they're sensitive - or they can't see it, in which case, they're mildly retarded.

Craig T. Nelson is the only realistic character, as Andrew's unrelenting, unforgiving father - until he has to cave to the unrelenting Romantic Comedy Arc of "finding his heart." Oscar Nunez as Ramone is an entertaining diversion as Sitka's resident caterer, store manager, minister and stripper.

Malin Ackerman shows off her beauty as Andrew's smalltown ex-girl, but unfortunately, does no stripping.

The two funniest scenes involve Andrew caught off-guard, thinking on his feet: when Margaret announces she is marrying him, as her boss breaks the news that she has to leave the country; and when both Margaret and Andrew relate the story of How They Met to a roomful of people, each taking up the story's slack from the other as they realize the other is making them look ridiculous in the story. Of course, the scene that this movie's target audience find the funniest - Margaret and Andrew colliding with each other nude - is contrived, idiotic, brainless and utterly hot for chicks.

Written predictably by Pete Chiarelli and directed adequately by former choreographer Anne Fletcher, THE PROPOSAL is one of those films where we know what's going to happen: two people start out by hating each other and end up liking each other. Which is an ironic twist because I went in liking the movie and ended up hating it.

I am a fan of the Romantic Comedy genre, but I failed to connect with this movie in any way. Firstly, and I'm not the only one to point this out - Sandra Bullock is too old for Ryan Reynolds and they had absolutely zero on screen chemistry. I just didn't buy it for a minute.

This movie is a combination of about 10 different rom coms and the whole movie is nothing but predictable. Who would have known - The power freak boss is actually soft inside and 'damaged'. The employee is actually from a very rich family and no-one knew. He didn't want to carry on the family business. They agree to get married for immigration purposes but who would have guessed they fall in love? (Didn't they already do that movie with Gerard Depardieu?).

The acting is fine, its the script and choice of lead actors that lets this movie down. Sorry but there is just nothing original here. Its 90 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

i loved the movie throughout the whole time. but i thought the way it ended wasn't as good, and i thought it could of been better, like instead of ending it like that, it may have ended with their real wedding. and all but other than that i loved the movie. it was a great movie with a great story but i thought it could of been in my top 10 but the ending just changed everything else for me. but it did make it to my top 20 and thats a fact

should you watch it? yes, its a great story about a woman who doesn't care about no one but herself, and then finds out she has to leave the US and go back to Canada. later she decides she wants fake a marriage with her assistant. they end up hating each other at first, but it all changes through the time they were in Alaska. then it ends with both of them really falling inlove and becoming a true couple. 

ill give this movie a 9/10, actors, story was all good, but just thought the ending could of been better.

The Proposal (2009)

Well, I love Sandra Bullock, and the theme sounded good, and so I made myself enjoy those aspects of this film. But it' s formula flick. It has great laughs and some groaning moments and some clich√©s and silly parts that are forgettable. Not such a great film, as films go, but fun, as fun goes. That's not so much to scoff at.

Oh, it's a romantic comedy, probably falling in some "chick flick" category, and on that score it works. Bullock is frankly terrific--she plays an unlikable character and you like her anyway. She got her kudos recently with "The Blind Side" and deservedly, but she has a whole slew of other films, most of them pretty slim affairs, where she is alive and spontaneous and remarkable anyway. Her love interest here is a flat but charming Ryan Reynolds, who often plays these kinds of parts (and has a way of making it natural, but never quite inspired). 

The director, one of a whole host of young women directors finally going mainstream, did "27 Dresses" previously, which put her on course here. It would be nice to see her not settling for a routine money maker, but use her ability to create a easy, funny, natural mood for something a little less superficial. That might just take better raw material.

But this is what it is, and if you're in the mood to not work too hard or be too involved, this might just pass the evening.

With a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy plot, "the only male stripper in Alaska", some crude jokes involving a granny, The Proposal wasn't on my watch-list in the beginning. After some terrible experience of Made of Honor or this kind of rubbish, I totally refused to see this movie.

However, when the chance actually come I saw it, and thought all the clich√©s are still right there, but in a forgivable way. With some good, layered performances and some honest and sweet scenes near the end, the movie is actually watchable, and with some good messages.

There were some reasons that I totally despised the idea behind the movie. A female manager in her 40s propose to a subordinate in his 20s to realize a fraud wedding? That would be disgusting. Not to mention Andrew(Ryan Reynolds) is principally what we call a big kid, that he had dysfunctional relationship with his father and could more relate to powerful females. In the movie, the justification that Andrew really loved Margaret is in their 3-year employment relationship Andrew already allowed Margaret to grow on him. Knowing all the ugly sides in the life, Andrew would be the best candidate for Margaret's husband. Right there, I got the message the movie wanted to send, that a family should be forgiving enough for the family member no matter how much they deviated from the traditions. Sometimes the point is not to accept the choice your family members made, but to accept the fact that they have the freedom to make their own choices. I, like Andrew's father, still have 1000 reasons to disagree with Andrew's marriage, but I got the message. Unfortunately these messages have to be watched very closely and heartedly to be found. That is quite a challenge if you hold the movie as a clich√© to the very end.

All that was realized by Sandra Bullock's performance that in some sense worth an Oscar nomination. Her transition from the cold, mean manager to the broken soul exposed to Andrew's family was very convincing, especially in the last 15 minutes. Also, she was able to totally cover Ryan Reynolds' pale performance. Thanks to the detailed character study, the movie surpassed my expectation.

7/10.

In New York, the Canadian Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened of deportation, she blackmails Andrew to accept to marry her; in return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Andrew's grandmother in their real estate and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Along the weekend, she gets closer to Andrew's family that asks her to marry Andrew in their barn, since it is a tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud.

"The Proposal" is a delightful entertainment and the story is very funny. Last week, a friend of mine recommended this romantic comedy and my wife and I really enjoyed it. The shape of forty-five year-old Sandra Bullock is amazing and her difference of age with thirty-three year-old Ryan Reynolds Ryan is not visible and does not affect their chemistry; they form a romantic pair that really works. However, Betty White and Oscar Nu√±ez steal the movie in the roles of the adorable grandma and the versatile handyman. I saw this movie on DVD and I liked much more the alternative ending in the credits. My vote is seven.

I'm shocked at how many good reviews this movie got here. I thought it was terrible and one of the worst movies I've seen. I found nothing funny about it all. It was one of the most poorly written scripts I've seen. What's funny about an eagle stealing a little dog and what's funny about naming a dog Kevin? How about nothing. From Betty White doing a crazy dance in the wood and then Sandra Bullock singing that dirty song with her to the silly town stripper to the baby maker blanket, nothing was funny and it was so poorly written.

Also Bullock and Reynolds had absolutely no chemistry together. Plus I couldn't get over the fact that Sandra Bullock is like over 10 years older than Ryan Reynolds and looks it. I mean, it is just not believable that he would fall in love with her over a couple of days in Alaska when he couldn't stand her in New York.

FINAL VERDICT: I now see why Bullock won that award for worst actress for this movie. It was deserving.

I tried to like this movie. I admire Sandra Bullock, she has contributed greatly to the art of TV and movie drama, as producer and actress. She excels at the former, and is mediocre to good as the latter.

But this movie is a steaming pile of every tired Hollywood invention going. The acting is very good, but can't be saved by this awful script. You kept wondering when the story was going to advance, but ended up sitting through scene after scene of the "we don't really like each other but we had to get married because (fill in plot device)". Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz nailed this routine in "What Happens in Vegas", a hilarious movie,and the same actor in "Just Married" with Brittany Murphy.

Betty White, in her mid-80's, is the one shining light in this film as the grandmother. She dominated the funniest scene in the film. Likewise, the epilogue that runs alongside the final credits is great. Oscar Nunez as Ramone also has a pretty good scene... but that's it.

Rent Ash's two films or better, buy them, if you like this type of comedy. No one can pull it off like him.

The Proposal (2009): Dir: Anne Fletcher / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Sandra Bullock, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Malin Akerman: A good proposal for this film is a bomb fire inhabited with several copies. Title refers not just to the act of marriage but also to blackmail. Ryan Reynolds is forced into an engagement to his boss so that she may avoid being deported. Due to being monitored they venture to Alaska where they try to keep the reality of the situation secret. Simple and predictable right up to its revelation climax. Directed by Anne Fletcher backed with a horrible visual image of an eagle snagging a dog. We witness the shame as it flops up and down and Sandra Bullock frailing about foolishly. Reynolds and Bullock wade through predictable drivel including a much publicized nude scene, which makes her look plain desperate for a hit film. Reynolds plays her bitch, to put it bluntly. These movies are designed as opposites attract even though this couple doesn't mix even when they get along. Mary Steenburgen and Betty White play typical annoying family members who speculate and make stupid screenplay assumptions. And Malin Akerman shows up as the ex-girlfriend of the Reynolds character and it is just another obvious plot convention. Bottom line is that this film's reason of being is to jerk us around. One should propose that Hollywood stop producing such drivel. Score: 2 / 10

The Proposal is an adequate movie with a clich√© and typical romantic comedy storyline and a star studded cast that sadly aren't enough to make this any good. I honestly expected a lot more from Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, I'm a fan of both of these actors and always enjoy seeing them in movies, and despite the terrific chemistry between them, it simply isn't enough. It myth sound somewhat original, but this movie still carries the exact same typical formula you'd see in all romantic comedies, I don't even understand why these movies are made without the writers trying to make an effort at being original and at least making a few scenes that are genuinely funny. The whole cast seemed to enjoy working together, but they're the only thing that makes the Proposal any bit enjoyable, I would not recommend it to anyone.

The Proposal is one of the most clich√©d and routine movie formulas in existence. A comically unlikable boss forces her assistant to marry her so that she can sort out a visa problem. This seems to be moderately popular and plenty of people seem to like it. Why?! Just why? Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds do have plenty of chemistry. They're good in the movie and although they don't seem to star in that many great movies perhaps they deserve to. It has mildly amusing moments involving dogs, getting fired and various awkward situations. It's not aimed at me at all, but the best films can be enjoyed even by those who aren't that bothered about that kind of movie. I hated this movie. I don't know quite why I hated it, I just hated it. The premise is awkward to begin with and seeing it get dragged out over 2 hours when it's better off for a skit on a comedy show is agony. The script is absolutely by the numbers and makes the film feel like a landfill of clich√©s, unoriginality, stereotypes, stock characters and formula.

The direction is very routine and cinematically the film isn't interesting at all. It just doesn't have a lot of charm or brains, and it's so insistent on sticking to formula that you know every single thing that's going to happen 20 minutes before it does. It's just awkward situation after awkward situation but it's not funny it's just... awkward. This is an example of how stale romantic movies have become in recent times, although to its credit it's so formulaic and bland that means you don't need to watch any other romantic films as every single clich√© in the book has been summarized in this. It isn't funny and it just feels annoying and the excess of awkwardness removes any real charm or surprises from the movie. Just don't bother with it if this isn't your sort of thing. If you don't like this sort of movie it'll be nightmare. Look at the poster. Watch the trailer. Read the back of the DVD cover. You've now seen the whole movie.
