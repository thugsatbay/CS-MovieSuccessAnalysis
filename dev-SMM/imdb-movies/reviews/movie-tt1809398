### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about. Read the book - it will give you the emotion and satisfaction you are entitled to from this survival story.

!May contain Spoilers!

This movie does little beyond telling the story of Louis Zamperini - and it does so with a lot of missing details, no character growth, and contains little else than drawn out scenes of suffering.

The movie is very similar to The Passion of the Christ in that the film shows little progression except when the main character is shown suffering in some way. The characters shown in the movie, Louis and "The Bird" being chief among them, have little to no backgrounds, motivations, or growth / story arcs. 

Louis is shown first as a troublesome child, then a youth learning to run, then an Olympian, and finally a soldier; between these scenes, however, there is no transition, no story about him deciding to go for the Olympics, and no story on whether he was drafted or voluntarily signed up to be a soldier. This results in the movie being very oddly paced and Louis having little substance to his background.

Louis, while suffering in the Japanese prison camp, is never shown thinking "I can't do this" or progressing to the point that he determines "I will make it out alive no matter what." He is simply tortured, repeatedly beaten and humiliated, and finally the war simply ends.

Strangely enough, no other prisoners or "extras" are shown being killed / executed at the camp, which does little to help show the brutality of their conditions. 

Finally, the movie ends with written paragraphs on-screen which detail his life back in the US and how he forgave his captors. One of the biggest rules of film is to "show them, not tell them," and considering that the written part of the story at the end contains more interesting parts of his life than most the movie, it seems the film was barely able to "show us" as well.

The source material for the movie; Louis's story, is extraordinary and exciting, its unfortunate that the movie does very little to give it justice.

I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. Granted the acting was very good, however, it was the longest 2 hours of my life. I kept waiting for something 'good' to happen and it never did. I believe this could have been a wonderful American story, but was nothing short of a huge let down. Really disappointed in how much this movie was hyped up. Painfully slow, and felt like two hours of literal purgatory. I am sure that his true story was much better and could have emphasized what his family was going through at the same time. Or possible they could have shown what the news had reported about him, and what the airforce was doing to look for him. Wish I could erase this one from my memory. The worst part is I feel this man was done a real disservice to his memory and honor.

***May Contain Spoilers*** The story of Louis Zamperini is only half told in Angelina Jolie's "Unbroken." After watching a screening of this film I did a little internet research on Mr. Zamperini and found that his life post-war, in my opinion, was equally emotional, meaningful and film worthy as his POW years. This film, while beautifully shot, lacked the true depth of Zamperini's life. In the beginning of the film, Angelina Jolie goes overboard in showing the viewer his early life and his Olympic journey. Next up are the war years and POW torture. The End. In addition to not feeling anything toward Zamperini's chief brutalizer, the torture scenes were way too long. After a few scenes viewers will get the point that this man went through Hell. What happens after the war is where the real story begins and where "Unbroken" stops. Louis Zamperini's struggles continued for quite some time until he found God. This new journey took him back to Japan where he sought out his captors and forgave them. However, his nemesis, the Bird, did not want to meet him...but Zamperini tried. I would have liked to see more of Zamperini's post-war PTSD struggle as this is such a relevant topic today, culminating with his will to forgive which ultimately saved him. For those who are only interested in Zamperini as an Olympian and POW, then you will appreciate this film. I found this film failed to address the full life of Louis Zamperini and felt his wikipedia entry would have been a better guide for Jolie.

I have to believe if in the hands in a more experienced director this film would have been much better than what is presented on the screen. The storytelling is mediocre and lacks the intensity that it should be considering what happen to this airman. I am disappointed that the script was so weak considering who had their hands in rewriting it. It totally lacks the normal Coen style, perhaps it was there and Jolie just could not figure out how to put it on screen. Now don't get me wrong, she manages to get the gore and suffering all right, but that is all we every really get. It would have been nice to see how that effects him in his later life and because we only see this small slice of his extraordinary life we are left wondering what the nightmares he survived as a POW changed him later and how he survived the nightmares he endured later on suffering from PTSD.

I cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie ,are the themes of bravery,endurance and forgiveness outdated?It is well known that the regeime of Japanese prison camps was cruel to say the least.The acting of the lead players was faultless proving again that British and Irish actors can play the roles of Americans.I found the movie moving, inspirational. Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing. One question did the leads fast for their roles or was CGI used to give the impression of their skeletal frames.The ariel dog fights did use use computer enhancement as did the plane crash.I found this movie much more watchable than the much praised"American Sniper"

Just came out of a pre-release screening. It was fine. Above all, the word I would use would be "safe". It was a movie created not to fail, and it doesn't. Watching it is a reasonable way to spend 2 and a half hours. A bunch of bad stuff happens to Zamperini, he survives it in an inspiring way, the end.

IMDb movie reviews have to be 10 lines, but Unbroken doesn't really deserve it. There's more to be said about Zamperini the person than the film itself. It was narratively predictable, but that's forgivable given the nature of the film. The problem is it was visually predictable too. If someone were to right a textbook on how to make an inspiring movie, they could dryly and apathetically describe this movie shot for shot. So...hoorah I guess. It was fine.

Unbroken (2014)

Heartbreaking, inspiring true story, told and directed in straight up high quality realism. There is some true intensity in the fighting scenes, in the survival scenes on the raft, and in the prison camp with its torture and hardship. And this is balanced by determination and hope.

If that sounds generic, in a way that fitsthe movie follows some tried and true formulas. The beginning has us with the hero, Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell), in a big bomber heading for some targets against Japan in WWII. As trouble begins, leading to the crash which makes up the real start of the movie, we also get flashbacks to his simple Italian-American childhood. This is effective, but it's sentimental stuff. And it lets you know the kind of wholesome intentions of the movie.

There is a lot going on here, in three main sections: running, surviving on a raft, and the prison camps. That Zamperini suffers and endures is the point of the film, and in that way the narrative is very straight forward. There are villains and buddies. The skies rain bombs and the sea is full of sharks. Some people are merciless, and others kind. But in the middle, through every turn and travail, is Zamperini. "If you can take it, you can make it," is a mantra in the film, and that's the message.

The direction and photography were first ratevery subtle in a spectacular way (or vice versa). It's a truly fine film, and director Angelina Jolie (in her second feature, after a terrible first try) does a really good job. The story, co-written by the Coen brothers and others, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand, is a great bit of history, quite sensational stuff.

So why did we leave the movie feeling just so-so about it all? I'm not sure how to nicely say this, but it's really a good story, well told, lacking some quality of surprise or depth it really needs to rise above. As amazing as the photography and editing (and so on) are, it's all in service to a fairly ordinary kind of story. Not that this man's life is ordinary at all, but the way it develops and is told is oddly routine, as narrative storytelling.

Good stuff, for sure. It's a bit hard to take sometimes for its brutality--there is a lot of graphic, personal violence--and the Japanese camps are portrayed as truly cruel (which many in Japan object to). But it's an impressive movie in many ways.

Although it is an exceptional story in it's own right, the film fails to dazzle or inspire as the book did. It never fully materializes into the epic experience it wants to be. The script was problematic from the get-go. Attributing a mans extremely brutal POW experience with a spiritual awakening and strength in God does not translate well on the big screen. Blending those two subject matters together in a seamless way while maintaining the violent theme that the director imposes on the audience just doesn't work. This films tries to be too many things so naturally it fails to be anything. You cant please everyone.The buzz over the last two years promoting this film really boosted my expectations. Only to feel extremely let down and honestly, conned. Perhaps it was a lack of budget or the lack of talent behind the screen. On screen the talent was impressive and I think we have found a new budding star in newcomer Jack O'connell. Very impressive indeed.

I was very disappointed in what should have been, hands down, an Oscar contender. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because the direction absolutely ruined this film, which misses the point of the book altogether. Laura Hildebrand's wonderful book immediately reaches the reader's heart as she connects Louie Zamperini's life story of growing up from a kid headed towards a life of crime to becoming a man who not only survived the most unbelievable odds but also how the human spirit can sustain anything, if wanted. Never during the two + hours does the viewer get to know the character, or his friends, family and comrades-in-arms. Maybe Ms. Jolie should have spent more time reading the book and trying to understand the emotional connect the book had with its readers than planning all her promotional interviews and short documentaries which focused only on her and how fortunate she was to have been chosen to direct the film. It's not about you, Angelina, it was about a remarkable life and humanity, and you missed it all.

When I first heard about this film, I got really excited about the story but the mix reviews had me walking into the theater ready to nitpick. 

Some people might not agree with me but the film was masterfully directed. It showcases the war, in all its aspects battles, death, starvation, and torture without inflaming the audience. I've seen documentaries that left me wanting vengeance for the oppressed. Unbroken is about Louie's forgiveness, his resilience despite what was done to him and the film does just that. It's sturdy and infused with darkness, shows the gruesome and the brutality but it does not make you angry, hopping for Japan to burn for what they did to him. On the contrary you hope for Louie to stand strong and stick it out.

Watching the movie there's an implied understanding for both sides, you won't like that Louie's brutalized and mentally tortured but at the same time you're not hating the guys brutalizing him. It helps to know how it'll end, which also explains the lack of emotional involvement, but it's about Louie during WWII. Louie is not depicted as a victim but as a person. I know the general consensus would be to almost break him down in order to build him back up but that would have been like blowing things up like a Michael Bay movie.

The performances throughout the cast was good, Angelina Jolie got the what she needed from the cast to tell this story in this particular way. The pace of the film fits to the story, the rhythm matches its narrative structure because it all flows together, it kind of sucks you in and bring you along for the ride. The side stories flows well in the overall narrative structure of the film. It's very easy to watch with its amazing array of beautiful colors and shots. There is a lot of potential in Angelina Jolie as a director.

Unbroken is a beautiful movie all around, the shots are mesmerizing, even the CGI ones, and the cast is on point. The story is inspiring and feels real. It's a big studio movie but it manages to feel intimate like an indie.

How was it possible to make such an compelling and inspiring life story into such a boring movie despite sharks and torture? Go figure.

'Lifeboat' with Tallulah Bankhead was filmed almost entirely in a lifeboat and was much more interesting than the life raft scenes in this movie which felt like twice the length of the other movie.

Bridge on the River Kwai took place almost entirely in a POW camp and same comparison I made above could apply with this tedious hour or more of torture and abuse that was also boring.

And how did the lead character not have a full beard after 47 days at sea. His haircut looked the same throughout his adult scenes except for being messy at times. Did his hair stop growing? The movie seemed flat and 2 dimensional. There were only 2 moments that evoked any spark of emotion or interest in me- when he was in church as a young boy and got slapped upside the head for not paying attention and the epilogue at the very end showing the real Louie running in the Olympics at age 80 but that scene was real footage and not part of Jolie's overdone, overwrought and, yet, uninspiring and yawn inducing vanity project.

I don't know if it was the acting which was flat or the camera not capturing any good acting. Even closeups of Louie's face in excruciating pain or intense emotion stayed right there on the screen and didn't reach the audience. I actually heard laughter during some intense scenes. Huh? I've seen more moving teevee commercials than most of this movie was.

But, Jolie isn't the only one. Many current directors work so hard at 'realism' that it is distracting. The old time directors knew how to create magic on the silver screen without having to put every excruciating detail on film. It's like they want to put a clinical pelvic exam on a video for gynecologists instead of a truly romantic scene with fully clothed actors when romance is the intention.

Bette Davis was scarier as Baby Jane Hudson than the Japanese head of the POW camp.

I just don't understand how Jolie could get it so wrong. Didn't she learn anything from Eastwood's 'Changeling' that left me not caring about anyone in that movie, especially Jolie herself? Even the very short scene of Louie's reunion with his family was so so contrasted to the amount of time spent on the life raft and POW scenes.

It just didn't work and I hate being so critical of a movie based on such a remarkable and extraordinary long life. But, the movie didn't do Louie justice and that's as painful as watching the movie was.

Did It seem like Unbroken got negative word of mouth last winter? After having watched this film it seems like the negativity was a bit unfair. Granted, Unbroken is no masterpiece, but why it garnered such negative word on the street is beyond me. (Or it could be my particular clique in Austin.) The cinematography and use of CGI were great but I'm sure that's been covered elsewhere by guys who know more about such things.

My main complaint is the film was one of those "It's all been done before" type stories, namely, with Merry Xmas Mr Lawrence (1983), a tale of a sadistic homo-eroticism set in a Japanese POW Camp.

The objections to this film's content as being racist and unfair to the Japanese may be unfounded, however, as the abuse was clearly the product of just one guy (the attractively effeminate Japanese Lagerführer) and not the Japanese race, or "system." Ultimately I rated it a 5/10.

I could not WAIT for this movie to come out. I "listened" to the book on my drive out west and it was started the day Louie Z passed away which made reading this book even more intense. I was hoping the movie would cast the same spell over me but it only really addressed one aspect of his life and I felt it was a HUGE MISS. It missed so many other areas that were just as fascinating. The dialogue was almost non-existent as well. It was almost like watching Castaway but with violence. Sorry Angelina you missed the boat! 

IF you feel you must see it, then wait until it comes out on PPV don't waste your money and time.

As Jack O'Connoll was getting acclaim for his performance in Brit thriller '71 towards the end of last year his star was beginning to burn even brighter by getting the lead role in Angelina Jolie's upcoming UNBROKEN . Cue lots of interviews with Jackie boy along the lines of "so what's it like working with Angelina ?" along with hints the film was going to be a major contender at the Oscars . Of all the films from last year this was the obvious Oscar bait . So obvious in fact that there's an element it might have alienated the voters in to searching around in independent cinema for its winners 

O'Connoll plays Luis Zamperini an American from an Italian immigrant family who becomes an Olympic athlete . While he's at the peak of his career war breaks out and enlists as a bombardier of a B-25 and finds himself flying missions in the Pacific where he's shot down and spends several weeks in a life raft where he's captured by a passing Japanese ship and put in to a brutal POW camp 

This is the sort of movie that has the Oscar academy falling over themselves to throw awards at - an epic true life story of the triumph of the human spirit . Or rather it used to and for many years the Academy has been rather unpredictable and somewhat surprising in what its tastes are and what films they nominate and give awards to and there's a strong element in UNBROKEN that it's maybe trying a little too hard , almost as if it's looking at prospective awards ceremonies with sad puppy dog eyes pleading for prestigious recognition . There's also an element that nowadays the second world war is almost as well remembered as say The Napoleonic or Crimean wars and war films featuring WWII need to bring something a little bit different to the table such as the outstanding technical achievements of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , the no holds barred war porn of FURY , or the post modernist lunacy of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS . In comparison UNBROKEN comes across as being traditional almost to the point of being painfully old hat 

Not to be too negative UNBROKEN has a well structured screenplay by the Coen brothers , the sadistic brutally of the Japanese is emphasised , Roger Deakins once again shows us he's the best cinematographer working today and O'Connoll is Luis Zamperini and never thought for a second I was watching a young British up and coming actor playing an all American hero . That said it its motive with having one eye on awards means there's something missing that makes it an outstanding film and it's never better than being a competent tale about surviving against all the odds

Director Angelina Jolie has adapted Laura Hillenbrand's great biography, Unbroken, and made a conventional story about one of America's true heroes, Louis Zamperini. I'll continue to think about how Jolie could have made this more suspenseful, considering Louis was an Olympic runner, stayed in a life boat for the world record 47 days, and survived torture in two Japanese POW camps.

Although the film shows Louis to survive unbroken, despite the-Passion-of-The-Christ-like torture overdose, and follows his life story accurately, there's no soul, just dutiful recounting of the separate incidents. As a colleague commented, the real life footage of Louis returning as an old man to run the Olympic torch is more engaging and emotional than the whole film.

The cinematography of the renowned Roger Deakins is splendid on land and sea while Alexandre Desplat's music swells with romance at the right times. Otherwise, it's business as usualget the history right. For me, a filmmaker could play with the story to make it more meaningful and involve more emotion if she has toand Jolie has to.

The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, "If you can take it, you can make it." Also this line, "One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory," doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: "A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain." Now that makes sense.

The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth. Like the film, Bird promises much but delivers too little.

As opposed to the boring torturehow about more of his home life or his search for Bird after the war? I want Jolie to do wellshe has an exemplary family and solid career as an actressbut, with the negligible first directing effort, In the Land of Blood and Honey, she has yet to achieve as a director.

When I finished this book a few years ago I thought to myself, "What a great HBO miniseries this book would make". When I heard they were making a film, I thought "No way. You can not tell this story in 2 or even 3 hours - not without cutting out too many important pieces."

If you have not read the book, you will like this film. It is inspiring, the cinematography is wonderful, the wardrobes are great, and the acting is very good. I think Jolie painted as good a picture as possible given the limited canvas of a two hour movie. 

Personally, I found myself watching the film and anticipating with excitement multiple key events from the book that ended up being left out of the film entirely. I'm talking important things. Whole chapters of the man's life. Things that were important to HIM. Case in point, everything that happens to the man AFTER the war is summed up in two paragraphs that run just before the closing credits! 

So if you read the book - it's a 4. if you have not read the book, it may be a 7 or 8.

Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it.

I have been looking forward to this movie, having loved the book and admiring Louis Zamperini like so many others. While the movie was well-crafted and well-acted, it failed to blow me over emotionally. It's one movie that could have been longer, while at the same time tightening up the POW sequence by at least 15 minutes. 

The director, editors and committee of screenwriters (never a good sign) cut out too much of the back story of what shaped Louie's character as a kid, and (critically) his PTSD and religious awakening at the end. I know this would have made Unbroken a three- hour movie but Louie's story deserved a fuller treatment. Instead, the character is turned into a Christ-like vessel of suffering for his fellow prisoners, rather than a flesh-and-blood person, although he seems oddly unscathed by the ordeal when he reunites with his family.

I was hoping for a "Spielberg" experience to leave me in tears, and it just didn't happen. Too bad.

While this movie purported to tell the story of Mr. Zamperini, who doubtless was a Great American Hero, his character was left undeveloped in the movie. Sadly the only person we got to know in this movie was Wantabe, his nemesis.

We identify with characters in movies who are described in detail as the plot progresses. Sadly we get to know Louie as a punching bag, not as a protagonist.

Contrast this with "The Grand Budapest Hotel", another movie of 2014 that also was a film set during wartime. It would be hard for anyone to accuse that film of failing to develop its characters. It cost much less to make, but left much more of an impression. Also contrast this with "The Book Thief". That movie made me cry! Why didn't this one?

Kudos to the Coen Brothers for attempting to save a drab script and helping the audience get through this movie. 

I am happy to see that hundreds if not thousands got extras work in this film. I would describe "Unbroken" as a big movie: a single face frequently filled the screen, the ocean was big, the concentration camps were big, but Louie was small because we really didn't know him.

Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is far too ambitious. She obviously tried to win an Oscar for that one thinking all Hollywood WWII tales are instant award winning movies. The problem with Unbroken is that Angelina Jolie is a really bad storyteller. The movie drags for the first hour and a half, with the story showing how Zamperini survived in the pacific. While it is necessary to show how he survived the ordeal, the way Angelina told the story is boring and completely uninteresting. The cast is also lacking, and borderline amateurish, lacking any emotional impact on the viewers. Jack O'Connell (Zamperini) is not suited at all for the main role. The final scene in which he carries the heavy wooden log over his head is far fetched and borderline Hollywood fiction. Unbroken is ultimately broken on all parts. This 140 min motion picture is a pain to watch, and ironically the only redeeming parts remotely interesting to me was the final cut of the movie that shows the real Zamperini carrying the Olympic torch in Nagano's 1998 Winter games. Save your money and skip this one.

During the World War II, the bombardier Louis "Louie" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his torture and inspiring his mates in the camp. 

"Unbroken" is a film directed by Angeline Jolie based on the impressive true story of the former Olympian Louis "Louie" Zamperini. The story is engaging and the screenplay is well written, showing the personality of Louie through flashbacks. The reconstitution of the period is also excellent. However, there is lack of emotion and the film does not touch the heart of the viewer. The only feeling inspired by this film is anger and hatred towards Watanabe. My vote is seven.

Kind of Fragmented Film about an American Survivor of a Japanese POW Camp that made it through Brutal Captivity but not before He was a High School Olympian in Hitler's Games. A Hero before He became a Hero, again.

It's Eastwood looking Filmed by A-List Cinematographer Robert Deakins and it's an Eastwood Oscar Bait Story with much Surface Angst and very Little Depth of Despair. No matter how Dirty the Actors are there is an Absence of Danger and Threat of Death. Multiple Punches to the Face and a Caning Upside the Head are as Nasty as it gets.

There are a couple of Inspired Scenes like Jack O'Connell Showing Up His Captor and Tormentor with a Display of UN-Brokenness, but Not Enough to make this Compelling Cinema. A lengthy Opening of Flashbacks try to Flesh Out the Man. Louis Zamperini, is a Rebellious Youth and a Bombardier, and these Scenes do Intrigue. 

But once the Crew is Lost at Sea Things Turn rather Mundane despite the occasional Jump Back to More Glorious Times. Overall, its just Not Engaging Enough to be Great Cinema and seems Rather Routine most of the Time. The PG-13 Rating also Doesn't Help the POW Scenes.

Overall, an Average Film about a Real Life Hero who was Anything but Average.

Unbroken a movie that brings insight to the dairy of an Olympic champion. 

His trials and tribulations displaced in his youth and again the target of a arch-foe during wartime imprisonment.

The focus is on his achievements, when the odds are stacked up against him, this being a recurring instance. 

The movie was produced very well in storyline with moments felt for this mans pain, given to Survival. 

There were many great scenes that show the producer Angelina Jolie's superstar experience equipped with talent.

These scenes steam from remembrance of pastimes, these lacing with perfection impact situations, thus in progression.

I do however find the makeup artistry was bad with complexions given to the actors in general scenes.

Visual scenes that stood out consisted of a shark attack whilst the rescue boat was being repaired, this catching most people out In the theater by surprise.

The number of shark scenes outlined their presence continuously thought-out the Sea Survival run, Illistrating a number of great scenarios, including that man is / was not the only casualties of war.

The coal boys clustered, was a great visual and the Japanese vessel finding the guys at sea.

The main man of this movie was not the champion however, but rather his Japanese counterpart.

A man shinning in talent his own displacements, emotions, national loyalty and leadership, young yet shouldered with his own expectations in respect of his father a general. 

The movie pleasing in story, a family focused movie in overall presentation.

I would like to start by saying that I have not read the book, although, I am sure it is quite incredible. Mr. Zamperini's story is remarkable and inspiring, I wish I could say the same for the movie. Be forewarned, this review may turn rant as my stomach knots thinking about this filmfilm?saying that actually leaves a sour taste in my mouth when referring to this soulless garbage. One would think, that within 137 minutes, a movie could develop at least a few characters, but this doesn't even get to one. How can you focus on one guy, for that amount of time, and not give him any arc, depth or intimacy? Did Angelina read the book or even talk to Mr. Zamperini? This comes across as if she just had one of her adopted children tell her the gist of the first half of it. I know she didn't write the script, but she has to take responsibility for the final product.

Louie says little, and emotes even less. He is given such little back story, and with the absence of dialogue and moments of self-realization, we don't ever get to know him or become attached to him. This may be the most tragic part and disrespectful to the real man. Show him struggling with his faith, or leaning on it, not just a mention that feels out of place given the rest of the movie. Give him wisdom and insight, not just the ability to be a punching bag. Why can't we see what was going on with his family from time to time? Allow us to see how he is missed and how they are dealing with it. The scene where he is on the Japanese radio, talking to his family back home, should have made me cry. I Instead, looked at my watch. Why not show how he struggled and reconciled after the war? Seemed quite interesting from the paragraphs at the end (best part of the movie by the way) Maybe even inter-cut the post war, pre-war, and war timelines together in a creative way. There was plenty of time to include all of this, but instead, Jolie drags the pace on a couple of segments of his life and then drains all the substance out of them. Perhaps it was symbolic as she wanted the audience to really feel the agonizing torture Louie was going through. The only time I actually felt any relation to him, was towards the end, where he raises a large beam over his head and screams at his captor. Not because this was a well executed scene of course, oh no, it was cheesy as hell, but because I felt like I had been carrying this long, heavy, undeveloped piece of wood for 2 hours and I wanted to scream.

We never really get to know any of the other prisoners, aside from the odd line of dialogue they get, nor do we see much of their plight in prison. So we don't become invested in them and we also lose a real sense of the horror the place was. We also spend a painstaking amount of time on the raft at sea after the plane crash. This might have been fine if Jolie used the time to have meaningful discussion amongst the friends, and although there is some, it is very little and somewhat forced. They do, however, pull a decently sized shark out of the water with their bare hands after floating a sea for 25 days with little water or food. I wish I was making that up.

There was an attempt to create a relationship between Louie and Watanabe, but it was again forced. We receive no back story or motivation, so none of the encounters seem genuine. Sorry, but the zooming shot of the photo of him as a kid at the end, doesn't cut it. When the two final square off in the finale, just like the waist band of my favourite pair of undies, there is no tension. I just didn't buy that The Bird (which is what this team gave to story telling) would break down and cry in front of his subordinates and captives because a prisoner wouldn't drop a log. And when they inter-cut the shots of Louie running, I vomited a tad. It was so corny. I get what she was trying to do, but based on what we had been given up 'til this point, it didn't work. Oh, but my favourite was when he said "You are strong, I could see it in your eyes from the first day" I broke out in laughter. I can't believe the Coen brothers had much to do with this as it lacks their signature cleverness.

There are some beautiful shots in this, but it is a real shame, how little heart this film showed, given the source they had to work with. There was a great opportunity for some creative, and compelling, story telling and a moving piecewell, it is a piece of something. I have never really been much of a fan of Angelina's acting, but there was always something that seemed kind of phony about her, I could never quite put my finger on it. So I suppose this movie is fitting then. Unbroken? In no way, shape, or form is this even remotely true. The most uninspired, inspirational movie I have ever seen. I want to call it tripe, but the word tripe is far too intellectual.
