### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).

The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.

The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.

The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.

Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.

Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.

As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.

Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.

Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.

From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.

Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "Sex Scenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.

Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.

Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.

One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade's disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.

Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named "Deadpool", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.

Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.

The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.

Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.

In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.

At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. 

The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.

Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). 

As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made

Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men)

I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!

The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.

The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.

The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.

I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for adults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.

This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward, to my great surprise to any squeals!

If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.

The story is about as hollow as the humor. It's a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of "love" that is as misguided as the character's personality.The movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.

Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny. 

This is the most overrated movie I've seen. Most of these reviews on IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow film like no other.

Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.

"Shall I spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded, self-mocking materialism, blank indifference, and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive?" - David Foster Wallace 

Sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party, Tim Miller's "Deadpool" charts the life of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who is diagnosed with liver, lung and brain cancer. Seeking a cure, Wade is left permanently disfigured. Not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves (Morena Baccarin), Wade confines himself to isolation, dons a mask, becomes a superhero called Deadpool and uses his spare time to beat up villains.

If teenage stoners directed a rip-off of Sam Raimi's "Darkman", it would probably look like Miller's "Deadpool". Most of the film's running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting, sniffing crotches, swearing, doing "funny" stuff, trading "clever" wisecracks and hurling incessant non-sequiturs. Sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt. Like most postmodern art, the film's tone is relentlessly ironic, snarky and by extension nihilistic. Nothing matters other than the moment, and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerve-endings. Man punches other man in crotch. Man breaks hand. Audience laughs. Repeat.

When our heroes aren't hurling one-liners, they're doing slow-motion flips, rocking out to "cool music", shooting people in the head, punching blurry CGI rag-dolls and rescuing women tied-up by evil villains. None of these sequences are done with style, or have any sense of tension, importance, pacing or weight. All rely on the cutaway - to "random" dialogue or "random" physical acts - to generate affect. This is all presented as being "edgy" and "alternative", a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie (from R rated fare like "Kickass", "Defendor" and "Super", to the wisecracking heroes of "Spiderman" and "Iron Man"), but the entire landscape of postmodernity itself.

Most action movies become cheesy, camp and homo-erotic with time. This is largely because conventional "masculinity" constantly defines itself in opposition to a "femininity" it deems to be weak, an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity. And so the conventional action hero is de facto "effeminate". And the more it tries to assert its toughness, the more ridiculous it looks; think the muscle men of 1980s action movies, or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today. 

In "Deadpool" these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions. Wade Wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly. He's ridiculously hyper-masculinised (even sociopathic), but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes, having anal sex and salivating over Rent, Wham and the prospect of fondling balls. This has led to some fans claiming that the character represents "pansexuality", when in reality, like everything Deadpool does, or postmodernity as a whole does, such "jokes" only exist to anticipate and short-circuit sincerity. Deadpool's bro humour mocks "masculinity" to stop you from mocking it first. In this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century "masculinity"; open to all contradictions, so long as it still gets to be the hero.

"Deadpool" is based on a Marvel Comics character. Like most Marvel films, it is strictly irreverence by committee; like watching a Nike sponsored live-stream of six ADD-inflicted kids dissing each other's mothers under a YouTube video walk-through of the sixth level of "Call of Duty 14". It is currently the highest grossing R rated film of all time. Its sequel is in the works. Perhaps also a prequel. And also a spin-off. It contains a character called Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

5/10 - Worth one viewing.

Truly awful rendition of a Marvel superhero. Turgid, adolescent and inane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from a failing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers including masturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this is you're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. 

Had this been counter-balanced in any way by a genuine malevolence from our "hero" there may have been some redemption, but the violence is all just meaningless, cartoonish and blah.

Incredible that the back story involves Deadpool's attempt to "win back the girl" when he, and everything else in this waste of money movie is so overwhelmingly camp. Right up to the end credits when our hero, as a cartoon, jerks off a unicorn's horn to produce an ejaculate made of rainbows and fairy-dust. Truly, this is the very stuff this risible movie is made from.

I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.

The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.

Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.

That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.

Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.

If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty antihero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.

Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.

One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.

As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.

Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!

"Deadpool" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like himif you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!

Memorable movie. It's so different from all the other superheroes movies. It's funny, dirty, sexy, savage, mad, sad and so on. Ryan Reynolds made the movie of his life. I never seen him like this before, although i saw him in some comedies. Every character in the movie is well placed and have the role good defined. I hope in the sequel the keep this "salt and piper" line. He alongside the screenwriters and director made avery good job. I can't wait for the sequel. Enjoy!

I think Ryan Reynolds has officially redeemed himself from his previous two blunders as a superhero. While I do wish the movie took more chances, what we got was still a great movie. It's funny, action-packed, and undeniably Deadpool. Just to give you some context as to why I like this movie so much, it's the first Marvel movie I've been invested in since "Spider-Man 3". I didn't care for any of the Iron Man movies, I don't care about the Thor, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy, or the X-Men movies, and I certainly don't care about any of the 900 superhero crossovers that are in the works. All I wanted was a stand-alone superhero movie that could stand on it's own two feet without having 6 heroes in it, and this delivered. The story's simple to follow, a little too simple, but for the first in what I'm guessing will be a series, they did a great job here.

Confusing title - I know, but I peed my pants laughing so hard that I felt like I should've watched it whilst sitting on the toilet. Normally what one can expect from a movie is a shitty love story (because that's what people like apparently), a "happy ending", and some kind of evil villain who will ultimately be destroyed or whatever, and of course lots of action and killing. This movie combined all those annoying features into the most genius, innovative, and eye-opening movie of all times. For once we, as watchers, are presented with a righteous killer (you know it's true) on a path of legit destruction who is not afraid of spilling blood, ridiculing everything and everyone whenever he can (kudos to Ryan Reynolds) and wherever he can. Bravo, Marvel, for making 2016 just a slightly bit better.

Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.

The "wink wink" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the "shame" of being "green" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).

Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...

This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.

In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.

What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?

How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.

There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.

I really want to watch this movie since it came out, but i did't have the chance to watch it. From the teasers, trailers i've seen i'm really hyped o watch this movie. But thankfully i already watch the movie.

The movie is a slow phase movie, it took an hour before i got in to the movie but after Francis and dead pool first fight scene it'started to get on me. Speaking of the fight scene i really love Francis and dead pool first fight scene it's well choreograph the shots is amazing and the set.

I feel like the teasers and trailers ruined the movie what you see on this teasers and movie is what you will get on the movie. What you see is what you get.

The thing that i love on this movie is that it's very different from every super heroes movie, from breaking the fourth wall from the goofiness i really love the dead pool character. Probably the track choice is the best thing on this movie the track choice is good it definitely fits the character also from the time adventure watch, hello kitty stuffs it deafeningly fits the character.

I think Deadpool is a amazing movie especially from a superhero movie it's very different but like what i've said the teaser and trailer ruined the movie and i took a long time to get me in the movie but still it's a must watch movie i will give Deadpool 8/10

Some jokes I almost didn't catch and considering how many subtle touches there are I'm sure there are things that blew right past me. Good thing I intend to rewatch it over and over again. I have to be honest and say some jokes didn't land with me because I'd heard them a hundred times in the trailers. But don't for a second think the best jokes were wasted. The humor evolves throughout the film; waking you up during the opening credits, and building from there as you jump back and forth between the love struck Wade Wilson and the post "cancer cure" Wade Wilson. This style of story telling worked really well in terms of giving us lots of bang for our buck evenly across all three acts while still being able to tell us what we need to know about Deadpool's "origin".

Ryan Reynolds makes this film. TJ Miller is kind of just TJ Miller, which is usually fine because no one's better at being TJ Miller than TJ Miller but as a really big fan of Weasel (yes such a thing exists) I was disappointed that writing wise they sidelined his canon purpose in Deadpool's life, but I have to be fair and say the changes worked for the story. I couldn't get enough of Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead was so damn cool and we better get more of her in this universe! 

But back to Ryan Reynolds. Not only was he born to play this part but thank the film gods that he was a producer. When that was announced shortly after the test footage leak I was so relieved. Deadpool is mostly masked for the film, and what a joy it is to see the scarred comic nut job come to life on screen.

I had people in my group who weren't at all familiar with Deadpool before this and it was fun to hear them enjoy the film and talk about it afterwards with lots of praise and energy. Any fan will cry tears of joy to see this property handled better than we could have dreamed.

Don't get me wrong, I like black humour and sometimes the Marvel comic genre (e.g. Dr. Strange). My dear wife less so but she usually lets me watch both black humour and the Marvel genre if I insist. This time, it was stop watching or divorce is on the horizon. I actually had to agree and we went on to watch something less juvenile.

I can't fathom why anyone would watch this whole movie without walking out. Crappy jokes based on gore and car crashes are not entertainment. I have said in other posts on IMDb that art and entertainment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, at most times they go hand in hand. Deadpool is neither art nor entertainment. It well deserves the back of the hand it received for any major award for 2016.

Really awful, trust me.

Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool.

With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.

Ryan Reynolds was made for Deadpool, he is Deadpool. You've gotta give him praise for his performance as the character, then again I feel like he's just playing himself. The movie was a fast, funny, and fourth wall breaking. It was a straight forward and entertaining movie, you'd get a kick out of this, nonetheless. I enjoyed the chemistry Ryan Reynold's Wade Wilson/Deadpool & Morena Baccarin's Vanessa had, loved every scene when they're together. Only problem I had was the character is constantly trying to tell jokes during moments where it wasn't needed, which in my opinion, kills the flow. As a long time comic book fan, I understand Deadpool's character but that obviously isn't my cup of tea. Overall, a very good film. Director Tim Miller to me deserves a lot of credit too.

Basically, if you watch the Trailer, you have already nearly seen all of the gags and funny moments. This movie is too short. It is a fun to watch Movie, but I would not Watch it again. If you are searching for a deep Storyline, then this is not the movie to watch, which I think, was not planed for this Movie.

Marvel has delivered yet another blessing to audiences around the world with their hilarious antihero movie, Deadpool, in 2016. The movie's main characters are Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, the antihero, and Ed Skrein as Ajax, the villain. In the original comics, Deadpool is first introduced into the Marvel universe as a hit-man named Wade Wilson. He learns that he has cancer and is tricked into participating in the secret Canadian Weapon-X program. After going through a procedure to reproduce the healing factor of Wolverine, his the experiment fails and his character evolves into the comic schizophrenic antihero that stole the hearts of Marvel fans across multiple generations. The movie doesn't follow the comic book origin story, but it follows the general story line enough that die-hard fans won't reject the movie. Ryan Reynolds nails Deadpool's original persona as "the merc with the mouth", and the rest of the scripting was brilliantly suited for the situations that Deadpool would find himself in. Situations where Deadpool breaks the fourth wall, or times where he talks to an audience that doesn't exist in the movie's universe, is his main trope and one of the many reasons why he is Marvel's most loved character. Personally, I felt the movie was cleverly structured in a way that will allow Marvel Studios to build off of the Easter eggs in the movie that hint to other superheroes and create mashups of Deadpool and other characters in Marvel's inventory. If Deadpool doesn't appear in more movies in the future, then there will be many unhappy fans that will demand another Deadpool movie. I am one of those people, but I wouldn't express my anger on Twitter or Facebook, or any other social media because I know that I'm not the absolute die-hard fan that most people in the fandom seem to be. To these people, Deadpool is not just a simple character, but the pinnacle of a comic book cult's hierarchy.

Numerous spin off series were made in the past that overplayed the character's nature and made him more ridiculous than deadly for the appeal of children, and with the announcement of the movie's release, fans throughout the world dawned their best cosplay of Deadpool. These cosplayers have had decently good costumes of the childish Deadpool, but the costume Ryan Reynolds received truly fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming Deadpool. I myself am a Deadpool fan, but I didn't have much information on the movie before I suggested to my family, and now I regret asking them to watch it. There was a suggestive scene in the movie that was NSFW, and made the atmosphere really awkward. I thought, "Oh wow, I had no clue that this movie was going to have a scene like this". So there I sat, shrinking further and further into my seat as the sounds of "hot love" echoed through the theater. After the movie was no better, because the first question anyone asks is, "So, did you like the movie?". Of course I wanted to lie and say that the movie wasn't good just because of "that" scene, but I couldn't bring myself to do it because that sort of closed minded thinking just wasn't right. The rest of the movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.

In all, the movie was one of the best "hero" movies of recent years. The acting and cinematography, as well as the comedic timing of raunchy jokes, were all important and expertly executed to make the movie into the success that it turned out to be. Thus, Deadpool is my most highly recommended movie to date.
