### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I haven't seen Amy Schumer's show but with all the talk about her it seems as if she's regarded as some groundbreaking comedian. While this movie isn't terrible, it plays it too safe and ends up being very formulaic. There's definitely potential in Schumer's writing and I did enjoy her acting, but overall this first film by her falls flat. 

The biggest problem with Trainwreck is that it's so predictable. It uses the number one cliché in romance movies where the couple breaks up and mopes around for a few days but then gets back together at the end of the movie. 

I hate, HATE this cliché with a passion. It's so annoying that it's not even funny. Off the top of my head here are some movies that use it: Ted, Bridesmaids, Bruce Almighty, What Happens in Vegas, Office Space, Pitch Perfect, and Rock of Ages.

The problem with this cliché is that it ruins the pacing and it usually shows a montage of sorts with the main character moping. Then all of the sudden the main character is inspired, gets their life back on track, and wins back their man/woman in unrealistic fashion.

This cliché I can ignore if the movie has a focus on other topics, like in Bridesmaids and Office Space. But if the main focus is the romance, you can't make it so predictable. Trainwreck seemed to have other ideas but does away with them rather quickly, even abruptly kills off a character who had the most compelling subplot. It seems like Schumer didn't know where to go with things outside of the romance.

Now, some romance movies do use this cliché but they put a twist on it. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is genius in its execution of the plot and plays with the breakup scenario in a groundbreaking way. The movie Sideways uses the cliché as well, but leaves the ending ambiguous and up for the viewers to decide. It's no coincidence that both those movies won an Oscar for writing.

It's not good when I'm watching a movie and can predict exactly what will happen. During Trainwreck, I kept saying to myself: "Please do something different, please take this somewhere new" but that never happens. By the end of the movie I was unimpressed. 

It's a shame because Schumer does have some funny ideas and I could see her improving with her next film.

Much has been said about the talented lead performers, and they have done decent work in previous endeavors. However, not much can be done with a weak script and with overextended dialogue that doesn't substitute for quality."Trainwreck" deserves its title for it crashes early on and never recovers.

We are subjected to the required introduction to explain the protagonist's wishes to remain unattached. It's most likely the first misstep for now there's not much to discover in the development of the film. We know and see a disturbed and socially inept person who is unable to bond with a person of the opposite sex. What we also get is a very unattractive person because her language, attitude, and behavior are really not much to entice any guys beyond the overnight date.

Yes, we can look at it as statement for a woman's right to choose how to live her love life, but why make the character so unlikable and vulgar. We have our share of challenging and difficult girls on screen before, but there were compensating qualities, and the script gave us intelligent and funny lines. Apatow continues on his crusade to trivialize and gives himself an easy way to please the crowds and not demand much from performers and the audience. 

Overall, it's an experience that will tempt you to walk out if you are in the mood to expect at least a decent film.

This movie is like a lot of similar type of movies; meaning movies that aims to challenge preconceived notions of "what a lady should and should't be like". It quickly becomes banal, predictable and irritating. There's no depth of character here, because you sort of get the gist of the jokes before they're halfway delivered. Having said that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good performances. Unfortunately Amy Schumer doesn't deliver that. I don't know why scriptwriters and directors hit the same creative pitfalls every time a movie like this is to be made. We get it: here's an urban girl with a modern outlook on life who does what she wants, sleeps with whom she wants and doesn't apologize for it, etc etc.. good, but then what? A movie needs more than just a cliché of a character, predictable jokes and bad acting.

This is *not at all* the movie they're advertising.

I expected a hilarious, raunchy romp. What I got started off gross, although not very funny, but then it slowed down. Before long it became tedious, with some touching scenes with the father, which carried it along for a while.

By the 1-hour mark I was willing to stay but waiting for it to end. Then it really started to drag. It's like somebody said, "Let's make a really, really bad imitation Woody Allen movie without the comedy or the genius."

When I finally just couldn't stand another minute I got up and got out. I knew it must be near the end, but it didn't matter. I did not care what happened to the two protagonists *in the least.* UGH! LEMME OUTTA HERE!

***SPOILER*** I don't actually have a spoiler, my whole review is a spoiler. The movie makers seemed to get desperate after the 1/2-way point. They threw in random scenes, apparently trying to spice it up, but oh, my, are they dumb.

Lebron James is a big surprise. He is good, and funny, and fresh. Tilda Swinton's prodigious talents are curiously wasted. Marv Albert, Chris Evert and Matthew Broderick must cringe at the very thought of what they had to put on the screen to get their paychecks.

Trainwreck is a very surprising huge disappointment.

No spoilers here, there's no plot to spoil and not big amazing scenes or reveals to discuss. Suffice to Trainwreck is a huge waste of time and talent. It should not have been such a bad film but it's beyond terrible. The humour is weak and practically every joke misses the mark. Lebron James is the best thing in the movie - he's the only saving grace. Judd Apatow needs to learn how to edit a comedy down to a short, sharp 1hr 30min as well. I shouldn't be sitting in a comedy wondering if I've missed a week of my life because it feels like the movie has gone on forever. I should have learnt my lesson after This is 40! I am sure fans of Amy Schumer will lap it up but if you're not one then steer clear.

I am not a fussy person when it comes to movies and I was irritated by this one within less than 20 minutes!! I found Amy Schumer's character pretty vulgar and crude...and not in a funny way. The first eight minutes of listening to her, really made me want to turn the movie off and it takes a lot for me to feel that way, kind of like nails down a chalkboard. She also portrays her character very superficially, which normally does not bother me too much, however when it's coupled with unnecessary cursing every 2 minutes, along with a vulgar tongue...it doesn't come across well. Vulgar is not funny, especially in women! It's trying too hard to try and be funny. Tilda Swinton's character was even worse, she was obnoxious and also vulgar, two very difficult qualities that make it hard to watch.

I did not laugh once (and I laugh at most comedies) and did not enjoy any part of it!!

I really enjoy Amy's TV show and was expecting big things from this movie but ended up feeling I'd wasted my time watching it and it's off delivery leave a bad taste in the mouth. Was it that Amy just wasn't up to a feature length film or was it Judd Apatow's direction that made this not work. Where Amy's mischievous bad taste gender stereotype flipping gags work on her show, here they were missing the knowing nod. Amy fitted her self centered character's skin too well and at feature length you started to believe this was a real person and someone you wouldn't want to spend time with, even in a movie. Schummer was too ugly, and I don't mean that in a physical sense. Hader was good, as were most of the actors, apart from the product placement sports stars. It really started to drag in the last 3rd, possibly because it had nowhere to go, which is exactly where it ended up.

And what a trainwreck it is! I have actually watched a few episodes of 'Inside Amy Schumer', laughing a few times and sitting there confused for most times. I understand how hard it is for a stand-up comic to not only star in, but write a comedy that lasts at least 90 minutes. However, with all my understandings I just didn't like this film. Small parts of it were kind of funny, but the rest of it was like a mashup of ideas that were trying hard to come together.

Hader was the only redeeming factor of the film. He acted with intent and knew the role he was playing. All the celebrity cameos (especially from some of the sports stars) seemed strained at the best of times. Amy herself is unrelatable. I don't understand why people are going crazy for her?? Is it because she is a female in a highly male dominated industry? I'm sure she truly is a funny person, but maybe test run these things a bit more before sending them out into the world.

I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend and we were expecting a romantic comedy but what we saw did not have much romance or comedy.

This movie is about an unappealing and dull surgeon that (for some reason that I never understood) fell in "love" with a completely unappealing, dull, dumb free-spirited woman that doesn't seemed to have absolutely nothing in common with. 

That's the main problem with this movie. Amy Schumer's character is completely unlikeable the whole movie and I keep trying to figure out what the men that went out with her saw in her!! There was absolutely nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about her personality. To make things worse she is not physically attractive. I know her character is supposed to be unlikeable, but dammit not the whole movie!!

The second problem with the movie is fails as a romantic one. I did not feel anything for the characters. They did not have anything in common and I am still trying figuring out how the hell they clicked. For this I blame the script. The are not enough situations in the movie showing how their connection grow. They had nothing in common!! They just had dinner and sex and they love each other. Did I mention that there was absolutely nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about Amy's personality and to make things worse she is not physically attractive. When the doctor told Amy "I love you" I rolled up my eyes in disbelief.

The movie is also way too long and in many parts slow and boring. We laugh about four times during the whole movie. Many people left the cinema half way through.

I did enjoy Tilda Swinton's Dianna.

While watching this movie I kept thinking about "When Harry met Sally" a far superior film.

It's stunning how endlessly stupid movies can be. I've never been a big fan of Apatov, his kind of humor never left high school, but then comes this film along, and voila, he lowers the bar even more. 

This is a movie that thinks it has some kind of 'feminist' philosophy behind it, alas, all there is are the oldest jokes that never were funny to begin with and a story that doesn't exist. There is no wit, there are no thoughts and for sure there is no intelligence. How in heaven can those people who are involved in this thing become 'names' that supposedly stand for something, whatever that is?

Is it so liberating to watch more or less ugly people who pretend to be 'actors' say stupid stuff about sex? Wow. Sex and the city is an intellectual giant compared to that flick.

Resume: one of the worst sixpack movies for 'womens'. What an insult to mankind.

There are some makers who although talented in a specific way, move into a space that simply shows their talent to be little. Alexander Payne for example could be making stylized comedies with no problem, but as soon as he moves into elegy and meaning, it all becomes a sophomoric play. We've known Malick in that field and Payne is like a film school grad next to him.

So it would seem Apatow has an effervescent personality, at least enough to want to move out from his comfort zone. He could be cranking penis joke comedies till the cows come home but wants to move into more somber reflection about the pains of life. He has tried this a few times by now.

Here he tries a few switches. A movie about the usual slob who never grew out of adolescence but she's a girl. Men are almost entirely immature or idiots, and for some reason I can't begin to fathom, half of them gay, that is except for the knight in white armor who patiently helps her grow out of herself. He puts them in that New York movie romance where a couple are on and off again and might even think he's turning Woody Allen upside down. Indicative; the familiar romantic scene on a bench looking over at Brooklyn Bridge ends with a blowjob.

None of it sticks after a point and it's off-putting to think he might be thinking of any of this as transgressive. So he has moved out from the familiar safety of what he can do well, into a space that shows him to have trivial insights and odd hangups, from primarily a comedy about life where laughter sanctifies reductions, to primarily a drama about life where muttering dialogue and stereotypes rattle in the nothingness of not having anything to impart. He moves, even if ever so slightly, into territory that Woody, Bergman, and Altman have occupied. But in this space he's shown to be a dunderhead.

I am completely honest and not exaggerating, this must be the worst film I've ever seen! It is a romantic comedy made of randomly patched clichés and some very cheap humor. There's no plot cohesion, and whatever happens in the movie lacks a development, it's there to be just a filler. The protagonist is a cynical woman who happens to be a very one- dimensional character too. I guess that's all about it. I was sure the movie must have been universally panned. And then I was stunned to realize the film holds a score of 6.8 in IMDb and 85% in Rotten Tomatoes. I didn't know anything about Amy Schumer so I Googled her and I understand now she is a successful stand-up comedian in USA. Could this be the reason why people liked the film? Or am I a hater?

WTF Amy ? An avid fan for years, smart sassy & sexy stand-up with intelligent observations and real humour.

And then this garbage.

Tired, clichéd, childish, boring, UNFUNNY crap.

What the hell went wrong ? This could have been so much more, "one of the boys" from the female perspective, but I suspect I have the answer.

Judd Apatow and his sick obsession with kidults, pot and adults that won't grow up.

As soon as that name came up at the end credits (was I glad to see them !) it made sense - Amy lost control of this movie in order to get it made, taken hostage by Apatow and his mind-numbingly stupid view of life.

Best advice I can give you Amy - ditch that fool and next movie keep creative control and do something worthwhile. Apatow is box office poison and you don't belong on the 14-17 year old market.

You have something to say that he can't understand and reducing the message to the lowest common (retarded) denominator is demeaning to all concerned.

Move on or he'll ruin your progression into films, concentrate on the message via comedy and don't compromise, look further afield. Crowd source if you have to but DITCH APATOW.

One star for Tilda Swinton, nailed it as usual.

"Trainwreck" has gotten really good reviews and I did laugh out loud while watching it but it went downhill fast and in the end I felt like I needed a shower. "Trainwreck" is about Amy (Amy Schumer), a narcissistic, abusive, alcoholic and drug addicted slut who meets nice guy Aaron (Bill Hader) who falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and Amy's life changes. 

The drunken slut part of the movie offers some funny scenes, and some creepy, cringe-worthy scenes. In one unfunny and gross scene, drunken Amy attempts to have sex with a sixteen year old boy who calls her a "pathetic, childless MILF." She punches him in the face and his mother interrupts them. The scene seemed to be about the movie punishing and humiliating Amy. 

I didn't much like Amy. She castigates a man for breathing on her after one encounter. She is unkind to her sister within minutes of her father being buried. She treats Aaron horribly, taking a phone call during one of the most important moments of his life. 

"Trainwreck" is directed by Judd Apatow and written by Amy Schumer. They are both very funny and prolific talents but the material here is simply above their artistic maturity level. They know how to make funny scenes; they don't really know how to deal with a drunk who tries to get sober, or a malicious narcissist who tries to be nice to other people. 

Aaron is a sports doctor and famous athletes are sprinkled throughout the movie. That just doesn't work. You never really believe that LeBron James hangs out with this sports doctor and has heart-to-heart talks with him about his girlfriend trouble. The famous-sports-star scenes take the viewer out of an already rocky movie and lower the verisimilitude. It's also unbelievable that a sports doctor at Aaron's level would be so desperate for a girlfriend that he would put up with Amy for more than half a date.

This film was so disappointing. I was ready to stomach what I perceive as Ms. Schumer's raunchy stand up which is basically all you have here. I am a huge fan of Mr. Hader but don't expect anything from him here. He plays a stand up guy there is none of his brilliance of character here. If you are a fan of Amy you might like it. Or if you are so inebriated or high you might not remember it. Unfortunately it's like a bad song in my head. I can't get it out. The title should have clued me in but I would have more fun watching an actual train wreck than I could tolerate this waste of time and money. Although I'm happy Ms. Schumer get's her screen debut I'm inclined to think it will be her last. Any character movie from Mr. Hader would have been far superior. This flick kind of leaves you regarding how you feel about dog poop. It happens but best to be scooped up and thrown away. I didn't even laugh.

I liked it, it's not like any other Rom-com i've seen before. It's obviously not a masterpiece but it does the job, it's entertaining, funny and different:

The characters are not the typical "model-looking"Rom-com cliché, they are normal looking and relatable characters. the movie is an exaggeration (for comedy proposes of course) of quotidian situations, thoughts, problems etc that happen everyday. People laughed ALL the time during the movie it's been long since I've seen people laugh so much.

I also discovered my new favorite comedian, the brilliant Amy Schummer. If you are looking to have a great laugh and a good time this movie is for you.

Apart from the eternal cliché of "love changes everything and family is sacred", my main problem with this movie is the lead character. She is unbearable, you do not get why the Doctor loves her, you do not see anything good beneath the bad surface, she is unlikable. So at the end, her "transformation" doesn't convince you at all, not that you really care about it.

I am not even sure if the writer wants to talk about how people can be bad and selfish and mean and that can change with love (ha!) or if she tries to justify this "ugliness". 

What begins as an intriguing comedy (the first few minutes anyway) ends up as something unpleasant. 

4 stars for Tilda and Lebron James.

I haven't logged on to IMDb in years, but after WASTING over two hours last night watching it and then being yelled at by people I watched it with because I mentioned it as a "comedy" choice, I was willing to reset my password so I could give it 1 lowly star. The whole thing felt like either a grad, or maybe grade school project, I haven't decided which. It was the same old story of someone used to being single, getting hooked up and falling for someone and then after a bump in the romantic road, getting back together. It felt like it was from 15 years ago. Amy can't act. The rest of the cast was a bunch of SNL-ers, who seem like they signed on because their show was on hiatus or sports celebrities who lumbered through their scenes. WHY oh WHY would this tired story be over 2 hours long? I sat there thinking of all the other things I could be doing. The scene with Matthew Broderick and Chris Everett. Why was that even there? Amy in a too short skirt in way too many scenes to remind the audience her character is sexy, I guess. The dialogue was like from an online screen writing class - University of Phoenix, comes to mind. Hader was a WOODEN LUNK. The boss was nothing else but shrill, like in a bad soap opera. All the sex jokes were the same you hear on Bravo! or USA or any cheesy network with serial reality shows. You'd feel so much better if you did yard work or went to the gym or read something or even changed the filter on your air conditioner than if you did none of those and watched this reminder of just how bad the movies, specifically comedies, have become.

I was so glad to see the SNL cast were involved in this film including Pete Davison, Vanessa Bayer, Leslie Jones and Bill Hader. However I don't understand why they made this film longer because it really did get boring in some scenes.

Like any other normal person would do, I just skipped along the way to the near ending. 

I don't mind Amy Schumer as a person but I thought her jokes were too outdated like I know I only saw her the first time in this movie, but still it was just a little corny really

I wouldn't consider this a best movie for the SNL cast because pretty much it went downhill for me I'm afraid!

Is Amy Schumer supposed to be funny? She IS sophomoric, juvenile, vulgar, and crass. Seems Schumer's character, "Amy", was only interested in the number of anonymous guys she could bed and how many times she could say the F word. At times it tried to be a romantic comedy other times it was just about how raw it could be and wandered aimlessly.

Schumer wrote this literal "Trainwreck", which was most appropriately named! My wife told me to quit looking at my watch, but all I could think about was the end of the movie and where I could eat afterwards. Maybe it would have been more palatable if I wasn't so hungry, even a large popcorn couldn't help! Bill Hader was the sole light in this very dark tunnel. LeBron needs some acting lessons, he was really stiff, as well as all of the other sports "cameos". Colin Quinn was OK, but he's never been one of my favorites. Vanessa Bayer played the good stooge, their male counterparts at S'nuff were just filler and added little. Swinton's character was just a cliché.

And John Cena, what the H, he and Schumer's sex scene seemed to just be there for the "R" rating, as if this would save this Trainwreck! I mean, a thing the size of a p-nut because of roids, really, would the slut Amy have put up with that? All around, a huge disappointment and waste of time.

I must admit I had high hopes for this film. Having seen portions of Amy Schumer's show and other clips of her stand-up I thought this should be really good. Wrong all the way. The film starts with promise but rapidly goes down from there. How many ways can you make promiscuity funny....well too many. Very few things in this film were funny. It began to become uncomfortable and very repetitive. Ms Schumer is good in small doses, but is no Bullock or McCarthy. Towards the end it picks up just a very small amount but goes back into the toilet. All in all, I could have spent the 2 hours doing something more productive, such as contemplating my navel or cleaning the toilet. Oh well, the next film I see will, fingers crossed, be much better.

I was looking forward to seeing this based on the trailer. I watch over 60 films a year so I am well aware that trailers can be deceiving. 

I will start by saying that there we quite a few laughs in the audience and the film went down well with some. 

However this movie has no warmth to it, no connection. Its meant to be a love story but there is no love. There is just something empty and superficial about the script and the acting. 

The jokes kind of hit but they kind of miss at the same time. Its amusing without being funny. 

Ultimately a letdown.

I'm not going to say 1/10 because I did laugh at a few parts. I dragged my friends to see this because I had high hopes for Amy. The trailer seemed pretty funny and I love Bill Hader. That is one of my complaints. Bill Hader as the love interest?! I had to literally hide my eyes like I was in a scary movie whenever they made out or had sex. It was so gross. And what was up with all the serious plot lines?? I was expecting this hilarious movie and *spoiler* her dad dies. Honestly I feel like some of the jokes are overused. The whole I'm a woman and I'm a slut! I have sex with a lot of guys! I'm vulgar! I make fun of myself! Can girls come up with anything better? Not to mention the opening scene was cringe worthy. There were a lot of people in the theatre when I saw it and like no one was laughing. She needs to work on her acting or delivery. I was ready to leave literally after 45 minutes. She's not as funny as I expected. Oh and all the funny parts are basically in the trailer. I don't get why there are so many good user reviews. It makes me sad that my fellow Americans gave this a 9 or 10. It really was a trainwreck.

"Trainwreck", hmmm aptly titled for this hodgepodge, boring, juvenile mess masquerading as a millennial comedy. The two guilty culprits here are Judd Apatow - director and Amy Schumer writer, lead "actor" and Exec Producer. This movie reeks of infantile, telegraphed gutter/bathroom jokes that have made there presence in many other Hollywood flops from ancient history to those released and buried this year. The most prominent "joke" running through this rabid dog is that semi sexy and OK looking girls, old women and preteens can and will repeatedly use the F word. For what purpose? Shock value. C'mon morons the shock value and any humor saying F*** by any of the aforementioned females is long gone and is now nothing more than boring banter. Anybody else care to join me in a class action against Redbox to get our money back? Jesting of course. This film desperately and tragically attempts to make a silk purse out of Amy Schumers sows ear.
