### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
After the many scathing reviews, I went to this film with very mixed feelings. I certainly didn't expect serious Sci-Fi  after all, I had seen the trailers  but I actually wasn't quite sure what to expect (and I'm not sure I would have gone to see it at all, If it hadn't been directed by Luc Besson). Well, maybe it's just because I expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. 'Lucy' delivers a fast paced, crazy ride from start to finish, and I'm frankly a bit shocked so many people seem to hate this film with so much passion. Hadn't they seen the trailers? I thought it was clear from the get-go that this film was first and foremost meant as entertainment (and it certainly doesn't pretend to be the new '2001').

If 'Lucy' were based on a comic book, I highly doubt people would be criticising it as harshly as they are. Let's be honest: from a scientific point of view, the stories of Captain America, Superman, Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Spider Man and the X-Men are all enthusiastically silly. None of these stories are even remotely realistic - and they were never meant to be: that's why they call them "SUPER-heroes". So how come so many film fans take the "10% of the brain" premise so very, very seriously? I mean, this is Luc Besson: 'The Fifth Element' was just as over-the-top and most people seemed to have really enjoyed it (at least at the time; maybe now it would also get shredded to pieces for "lack of realism"). The way I see it, 'Lucy' is simply Besson's take on the superhero movie (towards the end of the film, the title character actually comes across like a fun, female version of Dr Manhattan).

Granted, many aspects of 'Lucy' ARE very silly, but visually the film is absolutely stunning and it at least tries to tell an original story and throws in some very interesting philosophical (and yes: even scientific) concepts and questions. So not unlike the films based on Marvel or DC comics, this is a wild mix of Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Action elements  and what's so wrong with that all of a sudden? If you watch it for what it is  a fun, fast summer movie with inventive visuals  I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. Quality-wise, this certainly isn't 'The Matrix' or 'Blade Runner', for sure (but hey: what is?), but 'Lucy' is still packed with enough creative ideas and great action scenes to get your money's worth. Plus it features Morgan Freeman and an absolutely gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.

So my verdict: It's rare enough these days to get an original Fantasy/Sci-Fi tale with a decent budget in the first place  let alone one for grown-ups with an R-rating. It may not be as good as it could have been (and it does feel a bit rushed), but it is very far from the catastrophic mess many critics make it out to be. As far as I'm concerned, 'Lucy' is a fun, crazy ride from start to finish. 7 stars out of 10.

The film is not bad based on its technical merits. The lighting, effects, and acting are all fine and actually Johansson is fabulous in the first part of the film. 

What makes this movie so terrible is that it's attempting to make a sophisticated statement, but it can't even keep its own logic straight. There is no conflict; Lucy is so powerful and devoid of empathy that the film devolves into total nihilism. She just gun battles and goes on car chases because she has only 24 hours to download her brain for the sake of... who knows? Humanity? So let's rush, because without that all is lost for... humanity? But Lucy doesn't give an f* about anyone else.

What does a person beyond human logic act like? Since that's impossible, I don't know, and apparently the director doesn't either. Why does using more of her brain make her lose all capacity for empathy or social logic? Don't know. 

It feels like the whole thing is just for the sake of itself. Her powers and their progression are just not believable. Scene after scene of gun violence without any moral lesson or conflict gets very boring.

This movie could have made some sort of intelligent comment on human morality, the origins and purpose of empathy.... nope, instead it makes the comment that gun battles are cool.

This film has greatly polarized critics for its use of controversial concepts. I am a scientist and of course this movie gives me mixed feelings about its science. But I'm sure about one thing, that this is fiction. I am able to watch a fiction movie, am I not?

Some people review this film negatively for its scientific value, ignoring the fact that this isn't a documentary. What are these guys comparing this film against? There is no comparison against real-world science here. If somebody makes a film about black holes, I expect it to be faithful to the latest research about black holes. If somebody makes a film about the Sun, I expect it to be faithful to what we know about the Sun. In contrast, a film about aliens can stretch our suspension of disbelief a lot more, because we know no real aliens to compare it about. And my my, how wide a range of alien species has been spawned by the film industry in all its years! The main concept in this film is equally flexible because it has been proved a myth years ago. Everybody knows that, director/writer Besson knows that. These negative reviewers miss the entertainment value of this film because of something they were expecting (harmony to actual science) that was never there since the film's inception.

So yes, some other people review this film for its entertainment value, because we want to enjoy this "What if this myth was true" scenario. And we are truly entertained. I loved how Scarlett Johansson developed her character very well even when there was inherently not much to begin with: an innocent girl with not further background than dating some guy for a week and living in a shared apartment. Scarlett's charisma, weakness, strength, and acting spill all over the place, even during the most flat scenes of the film, even during the most VFX-packed scenes of the film. Morgan Freeman is... well, Morgan Freeman. Fantastic actor except for the fact that he's been typecast into the wise guy role for like, 20 years. I like the ethnic diversity in such a small cast. Not that they are trying to showcase it anyway, but it's a nice touch.

The action pack is very good, the mafia pack is entertaining, and the renditions of Inception, Léon: The Professional, and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all cherished. Once again, the central myth is developed in a very fun way. I believe this film has risked a lot in its development, but for us who want to be entertained and have our imaginations opened, this film delivers very vividly.

If you're expecting a character driven storyline or you're someone that is unable to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours then this movie probably won't be for you.

The storyline is nothing new and has been explored quite a few times, it's basically the concept of are we more or can we be more than what we are.

Whilst they used an idea about the brain that has long since been proved nothing more than a myth it works to drive the concept of the film. I do think with a little thought they could of made this a little bit more believable though if they had just focused on being able to use more of the brains potential rather than "capacity".

Anyway apart from the basic concept that we still do not really understand our brains and what they are capable of everything else in the movie is based a lot in the realm of fantasy. There was a whole lot of things in the movie that could of been done better but even with all those flaws I still found it entertaining.

The only thing that let the film down for me was the ending which even though visually was probably the best part of the film it still felt a little too generic and overdone.

There seems to be a lot of reviews on here that bang on about realism and it being unbelievable etc but if you are going to rate a film on that then recent films like Transformers and all the super hero movies should be rated a 1 because hey a school student getting bitten by a radioactive spider or super sized robots trying to overtake earth is far more believable...

This film is a fantasy sci-fi with great visuals and while not "realistic" or perfectly executed has a thought provoking concept.

Disappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The situation the main character found herself in had an array of extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in. If you're a fan of logical "what ifs" like myself I would not recommend it.

Obviously the main purpose of Luc Besson with this was initially to please the audience. The poor scared girl who takes revenge on the bad guys that hurt her. But with the ridiculous premise "what can we do if we acquire the 100% of functionality of our brain" the movie tries to be philosophical and ...fails miserably. What is the meaning of life? The purpose of humans?

The problem is that Luc Besson's brain isn't capable to provide such answers.

When Lucy's brain is at 20% she's starting to control ...tv signals! It's obvious that the writer will hit a wall by his own brain limitations. At 30-40% she has telepathic and telekinetic powers. Later she travels back in...time, and the way she controls it is with...swipe move as in a smartphone! What else is there? The writer couldn't think of anything else! 

I am everywhere! It's now a cliché since Edgar in "electric dreams". Johnny Depp has done it too! Well good for you.

I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their humanity and become real Gods.

Enjoy this film and let your mind explore the impossible.

Check the genre of this movie, it says SCI-FI, which stands for science FICTION!! If I watched every sci-fi movie expecting it to correlate with real life physics then there would be no point of the genre. All these bad reviewers seem to be on the more intelligent end of the pole but isn't cognitive enough to realize they're NOT watching a documentary!!!! This is a good sci-fi movie, which kind of lets you imagine what you could do if you knew everything and could do anything. Obviously It's not possible because you would have to break the laws of physics to even get near that point but it's still good to wonder. Worth a watch if you like the genre.

Scarlett Johansson proves beyond a doubt that she is able to carry the lead actress role in this sci-fi action flick. The camera work and narrative ambiance starts off marvelously. But around twenty minutes into the movie everything starts falling apart as relentless and repetitive force-feeding of pseudo-scientific and underdeveloped philosophical gibberish is applied in a sad attempt to legitimize the developing story line. If you manage to swallow the entirety these factual misnomers you may suffer from having no education or sense of rational thought and may also be eligible to blissfully enjoy the ensuing turn of events. 

Have you ever felt at risk of becoming dumber by the process of watching a movie? I regularly enjoy movies that violate laws of physics. However, it is imperative that the movie's setting allows for that to happen. Lucy doesn't. The parallel story line employs Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) as the scientific genius alibi. If you pay attention to his "lectures" you may notice this is not science class but rather something at the crossroads of a pseudoscience, scientology and self-motivational course. At this point I should probably disclaim that I am a molecular biologist by profession and proceed to tell you that I was genuinely outraged by the audacious amounts of ignorance displayed throughout this movie. 

Sitting at the theater this evening, my brain leapt in and out of sync with the movie due to the constant realism glitches occurring under false pretenses. For some reason I kept thinking of "The Doors of Perception" by Aldous Huxley in which he subjectively describes the immediate psychological effects upon ingesting mescaline and LSD. Such psychoactive and hallucinogenic drugs actually work by switching on cerebral neuronal pathways that by default (and apparently by good rights) are switched off. This goes to prove the point that cerebral activity in no way correlates with attainment of super-human powers.

The pharmacological effects that the fictional drug in the movie exerts on Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is irreconcilable with everything in medicine and the story line is shamelessly based on these discrepancies set in action as visualized by unlimited CGI artistic freedom: Wouldn't the sensation of pain be expected to be augmented to excruciating levels following a proposed 1000% increase of cerebral activity? Care to elaborate on the accompanying moral deprivation that makes it OK to kill or help people entirely on random, but first and foremost makes her really narcissistic and sadistic? If Einstein dropped his pen, wouldn't it still fall to the ground; Why shouldn't laws of physics apply to someone who is allegedly more intelligent or aware? How can increased intelligence allow Lucy  possessing no prior concepts of cell biology or drug metabolism to figure out what is happening to her in such detail? Why were the internment mafia thugs specifically instructed not to kick Lucy in the lower abdomen, considering the surgical procedure that had just been performed for the sole purpose of drug trafficking? How can Lucy possibly benchmark her cerebral capacity as a percentage? How can the final scenes of the movie where Lucy ad libitum creates matter and baffles the professorial board with some senselessly uttered line of thought be justified in any conceivable way? Omnipotence, dinosaurs and a black hole USB flash drive to top it off: are you serious?

The movie clearly begs the question: what is human and which aspects and ideals of human nature are worth cultivating. But how can you honestly care at this point as you contemplate whether to risk a cerebral meltdown or run for the closest theater exit?

F*** this IMDb rating. I haven't been this entertained in 90 minutes since Pan's Labyrinth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets 8 stars, and everyone is attacking the science of this film... f*** off. This movie is fantastically cool.

Remember, critics and joes thought Boondock Saints, Donnie Darko, and Star Wars blew... yeah. Watch it for yourself. If you're a Luc Besson fan, you won't be disappointed.

Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan "the man" Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do it.

This movie is terrible, plain and simple. It starts out as a fun action movie set in Taiwan. Scarjo is in some really cool scenes and is acting amazingly. This is cut with shots of Morgan Freeman having a stroke and blabbering one-liners about life that wouldn't impress Jaden Smith.

Morgan Freeman was completely useless in this movie. Lucy knows everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%. Telekinesis? Why is he even doing "research" on some weird hypothetical. This movie is literally better if you cut out every Morgan scene. 

This movie is way too pretentious for the few good action scenes it has. If you insist on watching just watch the first 40 minutes or something. Its not worth it.

Luc Besson, you really let me down!

I've been a huge fan of his past films. Leon, Fifth Element, Nikita, Unleashed, Taken, etc etc etc

The trailer to the film made it look like standard epic Luc Besson film. However it seems he clearly failed his basic science education at school.

There so so much wrong with the science in the film, and I'm no scientist! I enjoy reading about science and have retained much of my science education from school and right from the start when it was mentioned "what if you could use more than 10% of your brain?" .. I assumed that would get corrected a few moments later... not be the premise and explanation for all of Lucy's abilities.

Luc Besson seems to think having higher brain functionality allow you to time travel?

To be clear. The whole "10% of your brain" argument has been refuted many times and is decades old. 12 years ago when I was at school we were taught how this statement was total BS. Seems Luc Besson didn't get the memo and no one thought to tell him before he started the film.

None of the characters have any depth either. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, standard 'I speak slowly and deeply which means anything I say appears profound'. Scarlet Johansons does nothing to make anyone connect with her character.

The drug they are transporting at it's current state would be legal... So why did they went to the effort of kidnapping I have no idea. Fedex would of been much cheaper.

This film is NOT for: People with basic science education People with common sense

Normally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from what people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion. Because of the bad reviews I didn't expect anything at all. In fact, I expected a killer heroine who would beat her adversaries to pulp. However, I got an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold. So if you don't break into tears because the movie operates on ridiculous scientific premises, watch it and have fun. It's different, it's interesting and its extremely entertaining.

Spoilers Ahead:

Sometimes, I swear, these pagans amaze even me. Yes, contrary to what the greatest Greek philosopher who ever lived believed, Socrates, Luc Besson holds that the smarter we get the less moral we become. Gee, who doesn't have a moral system in their Weltanshuung? Congratulations, Luc, that silly guy in the toga, who wrote those overrated dialogs that have survived for, oh, a couple thousand years held precisely the opposite. As portrayed in Fargo, by the way, Socrates held that as reason increases so does morality. He held that inarticulate brutes, like Fargo's wordless killer, were the bulk of all murderers. I like Johansson, she is usually a very skilled actress, the only good part of the dreadful Hitchcock. Here, she simply has a role where her delineation is unintentionally comic. Bugging one's eyes out, speaking laconically, as in Ex Machina, actually is the opposite of intellect. Speech's speed and cadence increase rapidly as the mind grows in power. Look, I am sorry but the movie evoked laughter in the audience I watched it in. She tries very hard, the main problem is the painful materialistic base of pseudo science that this TRON like piece of tripe is predicated upon. Yes, the other reviewers are quite correct, talk about a protagonist that you could not care less about, as she becomes more and more like ALIEN ethically. Yes, running over lots of innocent people, I am really rooting for her now.

I concur with the other reviewer, the first forty minutes are all you want to watch. Once that guy kicks her in the stomach and she begins changing the movie into Altered States, traveling through time, visiting the set of 2001: the monkey years, and than comes the epiphany she transforms into these pagans' god: The Computer. Yes, lost within materialism, believing as Protagoras did that: Man is the Measure of All Things. Please, and you laugh at our metaphysics do you? Well, trust me, on behalf of all Kantian Transcendental Idealists your believing yourself to be ascending into a mother board we find a bit humorous, sorry. I swear, just step back from the movie and see it as an alien from space would view it. She becomes more and more unintentionally funny, frankly, and the movie moves from science fiction into the realm of Monty Python. I strongly recommend that if you are curious about the movie and insist upon viewing it, keep another disc near your player. After 42 minutes, we leave reality far behind and move into what I could best call: Metaphysics For Lobotomized, Computerized, Illiterate Geeks. 

I did not think it was possible, I actually preferred The Motionless Picture where Trekkies make some traveling ball of rectum gas bow down and worship them. Hey, at least it had the super hot Persis Khambatta! Please, computer people, do not come into the world of philosophy, you are embarrassing yourself. Start with Socrates, work your way through Hume, Berkeley, Nietzsche, Kant and finally Sartre. The best unintentionally hilarious science fiction since Star Trek 4: Get You Whale On Baby. May The Blessings Of The Divine Downloads Be Upon You. Le Poo Poo!

Lucy is a spectacularly ridiculous but very entertaining film which is the best one Luc Besson has directed in a long time... even though, considering all the missteps he has had since he returned from "retirement" 9 years ago, that isn't a big compliment. For better or for worse, Lucy employs Besson's habitual style, combining abundant action, a creative visual style and an accelerated rhythm which, in this case, distract us from the parade of nonsense and inconsistencies from the screenplay (Hasn't the "we only use 10% of our brain" myth already been discarded?). Fortunately, this film counts with solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who brings charisma and credibility. Morgan Freeman brings his usual conviction, serene presence and persuasive voice, while Choi Min-sik and Nicolas Phongpheth bring quite a personality to their villain roles. Besides, with only 89 minutes of running time, Lucy ends as quickly as it began, it never gets boring at all and it leaves us with some philosophical reflections I found interesting. Lucy is not a great film, but it entertained me very much, and I recommend it as a pleasant distraction which doesn't require us to pay too much attention. And besides of that, I like to see Besson back on the right track in his career as a director.

Let me start off by saying, I usually like this type of movie. I don't mind movies where the girl kicks ass, even when it is entirely unrealistic. If the girl also happens to be hot, then it's even better. Here we have Scarlett Johansson, one of the hottest women of all time, looks promising right? But everything that could possible go wrong, goes wrong here. 

1. Scarlett Johansson does not look her best in this movie. The changing looks, the futuristic makeup and everything just fails completely. The fact that she transforms into an emotionally void cyborg also means that she becomes entirely unrelatable for the audience. For 90% of the movie she conveys the same blank facial expression. Kind of like Will Smith in After Earth. 

2. The special effects are lackluster and sluggish. I have been waiting for a movie about a woman with superpowers, able to do anything she wants, but what does she do: She uses telekinesis to levitate a bunch of goons, she pushes a cop to another seat of a car, she stops bullets in mid-air, and...that's pretty much it. 

3. The plot. Besides the premise of being utterly false, the movie keeps conveying false information and misdirection. As a biologist, the portrayal of evolution in this movie is worse than what any Christian fundamentalist could do. Every 10 minutes a full screen notice of 10%-20%-30%...appears, just to let us know exactly how far along she is. This is actually good, because we have no other means of knowing. It's not like her abilities improve. In fact, after 40% she does not use her abilities at all. 

4. Artistically this movie keeps making cut scenes to completely random images and sequences, that should be used to associate with what occurs in the actual film. But this just adds an element of "weird for the sake of weird", and it just makes it more confusing and frustrating to watch.

5. The climax or rather anticlimax of the movie is what topped it off as the worst movie I have seen at the cinema. Spoiler!!! In the end, after she goes 100%, she turns herself into a USB drive for Morgan Freeman, and then the movie ends! 

It is completely ridiculous, and so underwhelming. The acting is bad and with no impact, the action is boring and clumsy, the plot makes no sense, and the ending is so under the top silly that it doesn't even make the movie "so bad that it's good". While I have seen worse movies before (not many), I have never seen worse movies at the cinema. I did not expect anything good, but to have it be that much worse...I was so disappointed by this, and I thought I had set the bar so low as to prevent this. I thought I would just see a mindless action flick, where a hot girl got to kick ass. This...was absolute rubbish.

Stupid. The antithesis of what the movie purports. The final line "Life was given to us . . . now you know what to do with it." Yeah. Don't waste your time on this spew. Remember Altered States and all the philosophical claptrap they put forth as plot and dialog? This is worse. First the premise that we only 10% of our brains is BS. We use it all. The 10% is nonsense that you can debunk on Snopes. Understand that the writers didn't even go there for their information and didn't even bother to read Wikipedia on this concept and you now know how weak this is. Steer clear, folks. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING to see here. Even the special effects are bad, low grade CG. Morgan, you've fallen a looong way since Shawshank.

It amazes me how many negative reviews this movie has gotten when its core, its message, is so giant.

I love this movie. Then again, I'm thinking of it in conjunction with The Secret, the book Conversations With God, and my own crazy experiences.

God = a giant being who was, is, and ever shall be, trying to become conscious of Himself.

Humans = each tiny piece God broke off of Himself to create our individual selves.

Lucy = one piece of God (think = SOUL) that happened to have an opportunity to become conscious of itself.

The end is Lucy breaking apart into billions of pieces because the physical no longer mattered. It was her essence... which is why she was able to be everywhere, like God.

I can't believe no one gets this. Look into quantum physics, even just watch The Secret. All we are is energy. If we take this concept to the extreme and to fiction, Lucy is what we get!

I LOVE this movie. BTW.

Then again I think deeply and on a big picture basis, so hopefully all these negative reviewers read this and feel like morons... because they are.

It's not meant to "just" be a movie. You really think Morgan Freeman would've signed up for this if it didn't have some deeper meaning? Look at his track record!!! Come on, people, use that gray mass between your ears!!!

Just saying. I love this movie. From a non-science, non-pop culture perspective. I love this movie from a transcendent perspective. The kind of POV that allows you to believe that nothing is a coincidence.

I am a sci-fiction lover and especially if it talks about human brain capabilities. Movie will make you to stick to your seat till the last scene. Title is rightly chosen.

Building of a story is as usual(much similar to one of the BRADLEY COOPER movie) which shows the effects of a human brain if it reaches from 10 to 100% capacity. Moreover the movie lacks on the details but just gives you a basic idea. 

Some scenes will really question your mind and provoke you to think over it. On the scale of acting both lead actors were good and had produced their best. And some actors are in futile role with no sense.

Though the film has used some fake data and hypothesis to impress upon the audience, you will be entertained and learned. Ending of the movie was fair enough in support of the story which gives her a immortality. Movie is more than a one time watch...

Morgan Freeman always seems to be playing the part of God Almighty. A part for which he is under qualified to play. In this movie, he plays the role of a university professor and again he is under qualified to play even this part spouting nonsense pseudo science and new age nonsense about the human brain.

Scarlett Johansson portrays a blonde bimbo whose dodgy boyfriend sends her in as his replacement delivery a package to the boss of a criminal cartel.

This must have been normal for miss Johanson considering that in real life she doesn't mind being the public face of a disreputable company that builds its factories on illegally occupied land. And just like real life a bundle of notes is stuffed into her grubby bra to help her carry out her decision.

The basic premise of the film is that a Korean drug cartel have manufactured an artificial recreational drug for the youth of West and Scarlett/Lucy is ann unwilling drugs mule.

However the contents seep into her stomach in a brutal attack by her Korean prisoners which causes the package to leak and in the process gives her superhuman knowledge strength and powers.

I'm surprised they didn't get Morgan Freeman to do the part of Lucy as she revels in her Godlike powers through out the film.

weak plots and story lines; 1. Korean criminal cartels manufacturing intelligence enhancing drugs for club ravers instead of the usual ones that mash their brains in.

2. Guy with British accent playing the baddys henchman.

3. Lucy does not die despite having a massive dose that is millions of times over the limit.

4. Drug miraculously allows Lucy to travel back in time and meet a dodgy looking ape that is our ancestor. And then she goes back even further in time to witness the beginning of creation. I'm surprised the film makers stopped there. I was expecting to see her supping tea and biscuits with the Angels and discussing lengthy philosophical matters.

5.Why does the cartel boss not give up chasing Lucy right to the end until a bullet finally puts him out of his misery? 6.Lucy transforms herself into a computer and then into a USB stick...neat trick.

6. Lucy drives like a maniac in Paris not caring about killing innocent people. When asked by the french policeman why the disregard she replies people don't really die anyway. She might have picked up this attitude in Israel a country she really admires.

Too awful to watch.

Although a lot of the things shown are completely fallacies, it has so many things that are proved and are scientifically correct. Like, personally, I didn't know that substance (CPH4) and I have curiosity to know how it works, and as a nursing student I have interest about what the doctor said of the mother in pregnancy segregating it to her baby. I mean, there's a lot of things in this movie you can learn about, and much more that don't. But, that's OK, I enjoyed the 90% of the movie and my imagination was literally blown up, since that guy made the question to the professor: "What would happen if someone access to the 100% of the brain?"

And no need to tell it. Scarlett looked damn sexy all the movie long. Thank you for reading.

Here's another real odd ball that I watched this past week. It stars Scarlett Johansen and that is of course all I needed to wanna watch this movie. Lucy is about this women who is kidnapped by this group of thugs and then gets a powerful drug put inside her that unlocks the full 100% of her brain and now she's super smart and seems to have the powers of Jedi. 

This movie is just really weird and not quite what I was expecting. This is of course an action film. It's got all clichés that were use to. Then becomes a super hero movie and then a beautiful visual ride. It's really confusing a bit at times and it gets worse in the end. The issue I have with Lucy is that she's the only super powered person in this film and there's no one in this that ever becomes powerful enough to give a really cool final final fight in the end, but a weird and visual like dream of a world kinda ending. It's not great and I highly doubt someone would become super hero or a jedi if we used 100% percent of our brain. It's entertaining if you don't look much into it and it's got Scarlett Johansen as a sexy bad ass chick with guns and Morgan Freeman Teaching science

We watched LUCY about on DVD February this year. I usually don't like the typical shoot- them-up or speculative-futuristic or robotic movies, they turn me off because they are predictable and way over the deep-end of ridiculousness in their violence, special effects, contradictions and same-old-same-old tin spaceships, weaponry galore, and silly story; like the script and story were just thrown together for the sake of selling something at the box office or TV. LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY. My husband and I often have different likes and opinions but our differences came together in appreciation of LUCY.

... it is a love story. About a director so in love with himself, and so powerful in his profession, that he can take any half-baked idea, an idea no ordinary director/producer could ever hope to finance in their lifetime, and not only turn it into a major international feature but land one of the hottest actresses of the era to star.

As a sci-fi thriller, this film succeeds .... not so much.

As a love story .. it is pretty unique. You would have to go back to ALTERED STATES (1980) to watch Ken Russell fall in love with himself (just the way Besson does in this film) to find an analogue.

Once you get past the first 45 minutes (a sad comment, given the film only runs 90 minutes), past the pompous and overblown backstory and still montage, the film more or less holds together as B level entertainment.

Not exactly high praise. But there is always Scarlett Johansson...
