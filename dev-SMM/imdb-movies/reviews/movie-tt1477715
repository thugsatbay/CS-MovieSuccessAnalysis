### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I haven't been since I was a kid. I therefore had zero expectations for this movie, and even groaned that I had to come in at 6 this morning to preview it for my theater. That said, I was completely blown away and entertained from beginning to end. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. He sang all his greatest hits, even from the J5 era, which really hit a soft spot with me. And people might be complaining that this isn't a typical concert movie...in truth, that is a big plus here. Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you're in a concert, but like you're witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was (to every little detail of production and planning). There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through (with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times). This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man, who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me, I'll be the first to admit. And a side note, his female guitarist (her name escapes me) had me picking my jaw up off the floor, and not just her looks. You'll see what I mean.

I went to see this movie as a non-Michael Jackson fan with absolutely no expectations. I bought the tickets for the world premiere as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. We went to the cinema in the morning and from the beginning I was moved. I have never done it before but in the very beginning a tear came to my eye. Thinking that this guy, with so much energy is 50 years old and about to die. When I bought the tickets I expected a movie with some biography of Michael, a lot of interviews etc, but there is none of this in the movie. The whole movie is about how the concerts would be, but I still didn't feel like I was seeing a concert. I was seeing a little family making a big project come true. I also expected to see Michael less weak, than some of his others concerts, but damn.. If you didn't know he was dead, and saw him dance and sing like he does there is no way you could predict that he was about to die of illness. There was no way I wanted to pay for tickets to his concerts before this day, but now I would pay 500$ for seeing those concerts in London. Although that This is it was about the concerts, the movie also consist a little sense of humor, love and a insight to the worlds climate problems.

A really great job, with great cutting and editing. This movie is a must see for everyone! Even though you aren't a fan of Michael, go watch it!

Forget everything you think you know about Michael Jackson. Forget the scandals, the surgeries, the rumors, the mysteries. Just accept that we're all innocent until proved guilty in America and let it all go. Michael Jackson was the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. This documentary shows that hours before his death, he remained the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. He was a revelation, pure and simple. And the greatest achievement in Kenny Ortega's simple, elegant tribute is that it allows the viewer, without a shred of distraction, to witness the process of an artist. Sure, some of the footage is a little amateurish, as this was meant for Michael Jackson' records more than anything else. But that's the fun of it. The viewer gets to witness the raw nature of the artist rather than the glossy outcome that would have been the final product. If you're concerned that the film will be an act of gross exploitation and an attempt to squeeze every last dime in the wake of Michael Jackson's death, know this: I haven't the slightest doubt that Michael would have wanted his fans to see this footage. Of course it's exploitive, don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise, but so what: All documentaries are exploitive to some degree and tasteful exploitation is better than tasteless exploitation. This is a film about the process, nothing more. We're just lucky that this process happens to revolve around the finest entertainer of our time. If you're even the slightest fan, this is a must see. If you're not, I dare you not to be won over. Also, if you're looking for signs of fatigue from Michael Jackson, you will be disappointed. In fact, if there's one thing that bothered me about the film, it's that Michael was in such terrific shape that it's angering to think he died so close to the finish line. We don't have many great entertainers left in the world. And the fact that at 50 years of age, operating at about 80% energy wise, Michael blows the top 10 pop singers of today out of the sky, is rather remarkable. Prepare for an emotional and downright exciting concert-film. "This is it" will show the world that with all the noise, all the distractions, all the craziness: Michael Jackson still had it. And then some...

I had my fear going in, but it was all shattered. What a blast. This is a must-see for every MJ fan and even non-fans to understand why he was so popular and deserved every bit of the title King of the Pop. A consummate artist, a perfectionist, and a visionary. The film is overflowed with his energy, passion, and dedication. If the rehearsals could be this good and engaging, one could only imagine what the concerts would've been. His voice sometimes showed his age, but his dance moves were not, at all. Also the young female guitarist was not just good looking, but crazily good with the guitar as well. Smooth Criminal segment is probably my favorite, but they're all very excellent. I don't feel the film is exploiting his death in any way. It's simply paying the tribute and gives fans something they deserve to see.

This was a clear view into the intergral preperation of a concert by a complete genius. I was never a Michael Jackson fan, however, my wife was and since she was desperate to see the film I decided to accompany her. I was astounded. I could not believe this man in the film was the same person that is was always hounded by the press and made to look like the devil. He was by no means weird, ill health, or a drug user. If he was, he masked it very well. The film shows us what we are missing as far as the concert goes and what a pity, it would have been amazing! He seemed at ease, and so happy and normal while on stage, as if it was built to be his. You would never believe this was the ''freak'' that the world perceived him to be. Shame on those people. Genius at work, a perfectionist down the smallest detail and I think the film has captured this very well. What I liked a lot was the fact that the film was not concentrating on his death and tradegy, but solely on his concert, his music, and his geniality and it was a fitting tribute to one of the greatest musicians of our times. So I would urge anyone who has had any miss conceptions about the man to go see this, you like me will more than likely change your views on the man. RIP

No one has any apology to make about this wonderful documentary, least of all Kenny Ortega. When I heard he intended to take "rehearsal" footage of the "This Is It" tour and market it as a film, I assumed it was an attempt to recoup the investment made in the project. Who could have guessed that this film would stand on its own and also enter the echelons of the "best" documentaries about rock music ever made? No less, Michael Jackson reveals more about himself in this footage than we've ever seen before. It's his premiere moment on film, and I would guess he would not have wanted it shown only because we seefor the first timeJackson without a mask. I won't attempt to characterize this complicated, insanely talented, person, but basically he's painfully shy. And he excelled at one of the most public vocations there is: performing.

What's interesting about the footage is that it exists at all. But since concerts today use video projection for the large venues where they play, it was natural to include the cameras during the rehearsal period. And it's riveting! Nothing is ever less than compelling in large part due to the level of talent in all quarters. The dancers, the musicians, the back-up singers, sets, costumesit's a parade of the best of the best. While Jackson is the center of all of this, if you don't care for him, there's plenty of other things to look at and enjoy.

Any sadness is brought by the viewer. There's not one nod to Jackson's demise or when it occurs. He looks thin, but even in a rehearsal mode, he's electrifying, and I think that's why the film works. We're not at some huge arena (for which the concert was conceived) with 10,000 screaming fans. And rather than missing that electricity, we get intimate performances of familiar Jackson material. But it's re-imagined and you never know what's coming next.

An alert: there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can, see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience!

Just came back from screening of this movie.

I went with very low expectation but it was really great movie. Lots of MJ songs and practice sessions.

His female guitarist was out of the world, simply superb.

I wish they had shown or MJ has performed some more of his stunts (moon walk, dance stunts etc etc)... so deducted 1 star for this...

MJ was so humble, I dint expect that from such a big start... I m really impressed with his behavior towards his troop :) I m not a big MJ fan.. and I was totally amazed by editing and quality of movie... I m pretty sure MJ fans would love this....

Hats off to MJ ... RIP....

My wife asked me to see this movie tonight as sort of a preview,to let her know if we should see it together on our day off.As we are both Michael Jackson fans,I would have to give an emphatic "YES" to that.I was really apprehensive,since I thought that it would just be some rehearsals with tons of filler(biographical info,etc),but most of the numbers were pretty fleshed out,music and choreography wise.Some of the special effects were amazing,and I really liked the extended intro of "The Way You Make Me Feel".I liked the way they tried to make the film feel like a performance,rather than a eulogy.The talent,from the dancers to the musicians to the lighting and effects crew were just first rate all the way.I thought beforehand that this might be just a cynical cash grab-one more trip to the ATM from Michaels legacy,but honestly,I think they may just be trying to recoup some of the enormous costs of putting on a show that never came to fruition.And if some of us fans can enjoy seeing MJ one more time in such a classy way,Im all for it.

I saw This Is It today and all i can say is that it is fitting for the man Michael. That will say more than anything else about how well done this movie is. It makes me sad when i see what a fantastic production this could've been to know that the world never got a chance to see it. But i know it would've been amazing, that's more than enough for me. 

For the film it is basically all of his biggest hits that would've been performed in the shows on the big screen instead. It's just rehearsal but he's still amazing in them. Between each song you got some insight into the bigger picture of the shows themselves, and sometimes you'd even get to see Michael as himself. 

Michael you were truly one of God's greatest gifts to those of us lucky to be alive now. R.I.P

Just came from seeing the movie and plan to go and see it again soon, probably tomorrow. I am a MJ fan since I was 10. I hope I was going to be cry but I was just admiring the priceless piece of work in front of me. There was so much creativity, sweetness, professionalism, understanding, effort, energy in that film that didn't leave me any chance of crying. The professionalism and patience of ortega was outstanding, he was perfect for this whole production, the cast was phenomenal, MJ was awesome. Come on! 50 years old and dancing, singing like that? Absolutely amazing. This movie deserves to be seen over and over. My final thought: Michael Jackson will be forever the king of pop and music and he did really give us a final precious work..."this is it".

A strong feeling of love towards myself, everyone around me and planet Earth is what I left the cinema feeling. Michael was alive again for those two hours. This Is It showcases the King of Pop at his finest.

As the lights blackened and the Columbia Pictures animation played, the theatre erupted with cheers of "I love you Michael" and "God bless you Michael". After the chaos died down the audience sat in awe as the King did what he did best; he thrilled us.

From the rocking tunes of They Don't Care About Us and Beat It(which I was particularly impressed with) to those real toe tapping hits such as The Way You Make Me Feel, Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin' Something to the beautifully emotional songs that really showcased Michael's ability as a singer such as Human Nature and I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Michael truly dominated the stage. Every single person in the theatre was singing along and clapping for and after every song. I was over the moon with the recreation of the Jackson Five seeing as The Love You Save is a touching one for me. The real fun came with the especially theatrical numbers that were Thriller and Smooth Criminal, both had me in fits of happiness. Then, after a dramatic and heart touching rendition of Earth Song, Man In The Mirror drew the whole show to its close, emanating love and Michael's passion for people to make a change.

I saw not one single thing, in my opinion, wrong with this film and I believe everyone will enjoy it. If you aren't a Michael Jackson fan, while you may not appreciate the significance of This Is It, you will sure as hell have a brilliant time. And if you are an MJ fan, you will truly appreciate the greatness and strong sense of meaning behind the final documentation of the true King of Pop's work, the legacy of Michael Jackon.

Film is such an ordinary business in many respects that when something unique comes along, it takes on an importance on that fact alone.

Whatever you think of the music, he was a person manufactured to exist only in the media marketplace, uncomfortable and profoundly unsuccessful at a human scale. He, like some other performers I suppose, can only live, can only actually breath on a stage, and then only if it is bigger and more dynamic than any ever created. If I had seen the show, I would likely have left crying about the huge waste of resources, the fantastic color budget, there only to suspend a shaky being and the shakier admiration we grew to need.

The form of the film is set up to keep us from reminding ourselves that we are not seeing a concert. Instead we are seeing stuff that would have been culled for a terse "making of" DVD extra, one focused on how the most expensive and elaborate stage show in history was put together. Jackson would never have allowed us to see him as a human, never allowed us to see him not trying hard. He would have hidden what he knew to be his great weaknesses  that he was never allowed to develop a mind, a means of articulation, any semblance of connection to the world outside his craft. If it were possible for him to know about this, it would be a hell for him, knowing that we can see him as he is, not as he invented the image:

He knows music and movement at an intuitive level, perhaps qualifying as genius, but he cannot speak more than four words that are genuine, even when it comes to the music. He is a master showman, but unable to imagine anything at all, instead only see what others have done for him and intuit how it needs to bend to fit him in. There are sequences here that you can see someone was clever with, for instance a sequence which would have him composited into old movies. He is terminally uncomfortable in this, and one can imagine the angst of identity he carried home and which had to be drugged away. The man shown here as his trusted collaborator (credited as "director") was who killed Jackson, by shifting the only world he knew.

The performances themselves are remarkable. The singing is unrewarding; he tells us repeatedly that he isn't really using his voice, that he is preparing to warm up, knowing that physical stress was coming. We don't notice it much because we know the songs so well, and what we hear has been supplemented dishonestly. But the dancing IS rewarding. The backup dancers are rewarding in the usual way; they are the best in the world, possibly  given advances in the science of training  the best ever assembled. Each time we see them, they are working hard as if their lives depended on it. In terms of narrative, the film is about them (and to a lesser extent the backup musicians). We see the tryouts, and the announcements of the winners. We see some truly extraordinary people here. This is where the energy comes from.

Jackson's dancing is remarkable as well, but for different reasons. He reinvented stage dance. He is as influential as Astair, more because his visual style transformed music into a video art, a transitional metamedia where it stands today. We may be even more familiar with his moves than his sounds. He lopes through the numbers. It isn't fair to expect him to be good. His body is in pain; joints are taped up to allow even what we see.

But what we see, even if it lacks energy, is amazing. Jackson is important because he created himself and everything about himself. Even his ideas about love and peace are fabricated. But the invention: face, clothes, music, pseudofamily and all are physically situated. He has created it all in the context of the space around him and how he moves in it. Even the iconic moonwalk where physics seems denied indicates this. It is remarkable not only because he invented a self, one that it is outrageous and comic in every detail, but that it is coherent and has an inner logic. That inner logic is spatial, a logic of movement. His soul invents itself first in movement and builds a self to occupy. 

This part alone makes the film amazing. Often in the film, we see numbers from beginning to end that are assembled from different rehearsals. In some of these rehearsals, it is clear that he has just arrived on the set that has been cooking for months. His stage choreography is made up on the spot. As the splices shift back and forth, you can see that each time, he is making up a different  sometimes wildly different  routine. He does so effortlessly. He does so automatically and with grace. But most remarkable is that it makes sense each time. It is a whole soul, coherent and true, visible. Visible to us, conveying that sense, that spatial logic.

What an experience. It is sad that he had to suffer and die so this could come to us. If he had lived, he would have made a big show. As it is, we are allowed to see him in his own private show, living in movement, exposed.

Fans around the world had a very sad day this year when the news of Michael Jackson's death was announced. Michael had inspired so many, wither it was dancing, singing, wardrobe, or just being a generous human. The thing that made Michael so special that many people don't realize why he was so special to so many, how many years Michael had been performing. Since he was a child, my grandparents, my parents and my sister and I were fans. 3 generations as I'm sure many families feel the same.

This Is It was supposed to be Michael's major comeback tour after years of hiding after all the child molestation trial drama. 50 sold out concerts in London, I was so excited and hoping he was going to possibly come back to the states for another world tour and was even looking up how much the tickets were. Unfortunately, Michael passed away just a few days away from performing.

This Is It documents the rehearsal footage of his future concerts. Ranging from a wide variety of his mega hits from his newest song This Is It going back to his roots singing "I Want You Back", "I'll Be There" and "State of Shock". Of course also performing all of the fan favorites from his Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous Albums as well. Watching this movie got me teary eyed as well as others in the theater when he performed both "Human Nature" and "I'll Be There", he still had his wonderful voice giving his all. Michael was an absolute perfectionist and his shows in this documentary as other describe how he knows his tune and his years of experience has helped them grow.

Also having little commentaries with the musicians and dancers, everyone so excited to work with Michael. You could tell this was the cherry on top of the sundae for them working with one of the world's greatest entertainers. The girl who was rocking out on the lead guitar was beyond awesome, my sister and I had our jaws dropped on how she just tickled those strings making those incredible sounds come out. The dancers were also just wonderful and had such energy and pr essence and would've done a terrific job.

All I can say is that This Is It would have been the ultimate concert. Michael really went all out for this concert with mini movies introducing his songs. He had a little Chicago gangsters clip with Humphrey Bogart and other gangsters chasing after Michael. Thriller was also such a show with the dancers rising from their graves and their costumes were awesome! Michael also did a very touching performance of Earth Song that would make anyone want to look at our Earth and want to make a difference.

To sum this up, this was a gift to Michael Jackson fans and was incredible to watch. Even if you're not a MJ fan like my boyfriend is, you'll still enjoy it, he was impressed on how dedicated everyone was and loved the music. This Is It should not be missed!

I hadn't really planned to see this show today, but a dental appointment was timed such that I ate lunch in a mall here in Bangkok and wandered by the multiplex upstairs after eating. The second showing of the day was to start in ten minutes, so I bought a ticket. There had been advance-booking for the last couple of weeks, with a chart showing the available seats for each show. A week ago the showings had two or three seats booked at best for any show. For the showing I attended there were twenty-five people in a five hundred seat house. I looked at a poster on my way in and realized this was the first day of release, so this was a disappointing turnout.

I don't know what material was available from the tapes of rehearsals, but the film as a whole is often a bit of a patch-work quilt, sometimes feeling somewhat like the pieces are a bit mismatched. In some numbers there are frequent cuts back and forth from at least three different occasions, as shown by Michael wearing different wardrobe. Also adding to this effect is the fact that some shots were captured in high-definition, others in standard video which are inter-cut for the same songs. The audio on the other hand is pretty seamless and of high quality throughout. Sometimes a song sequence is interrupted to show a behind the scenes conference on how to proceed. Many songs are not included in their entirety, apparently to allow for such background material to be included instead. Much of the show seemed like an extended "making of" extra to a main event.

Again, I do not know what material was available, but if most songs were recorded in their entirety, I think I would have preferred to see an attempt to show what the final concert would have been like, without so many interruptions. If I had directed it, I would have done a few minutes of the behind the show material first and then attempt a concert experience. For instance, there is a sequence done in B&W with MJ interacting in a crime movie facing a menacing Humphrey Bogart after watching Rita Hayworth sing. But this segment is interrupted multiple times with color shots done on stage, some with the associated song, some not. I was disappointed not to be able to see the way the B&W segment would have played in concert. I am guessing it would have been in one continuous piece.

As it is, I can see where the concert would have been a real treat. I worked as a stage hand for a Jackson Five concert over thirty-seven years ago, and it was well done but far less elaborate. Michael's voice and dancing still appeared to be in top form to me despite all the intervening years, and the set design and lighting was elaborate and effective. Perhaps the show was edited as it is to allow us to see him as a perfectionist at work, but someone who had rapport with his cast and crew. His interaction with the cute blonde lady guitarist is a high-light. He comes across as a normal, down to earth person, albeit one that is incredibly talented. 

I felt a little sad at times while watching this show because he seemed so vital and fit that it is still hard to accept that he is gone. Perhaps he really could have played fifty play-dates in London without faltering. Considering how vigorous the numbers are, this would have been another great achievement for him.

As for me I thought that this moving was amazing... If you are a Michael fan it is a must see, you will see him in a whole new way and if you are a hater you need to see it because it may just make you change your opinion about this amazing, talented man. He is so talented and gracious and for as amazing and talented as he was he didn't even act all superior he was kind and loving... Oh and the guitarist are just wow.... You gotta see it in IMAX I know I wanna go back and see it in IMAX!!! At the end it was dedicated to his three kids....

Michael Jackson is The Man.

No statement better sums up the artistic genius who is arguably the greatest performer of all time. Witnessing him here is nothing short of breathtaking; he effortlessly exudes coolness, everyone and everything around him directly benefitting from his unique persona. His natural charisma and talent is unparalleled, his body a rhythmic treasure. Every 360 spin, every whiplash hand movement, every grab of the crotch, every nod of the head: iconic, hypnotic actions that are given an instant gravitas by Michael. Watching him dance and glide across the stage floor is akin to seeing Michael Jordan slam dunk or Marlon Brando act  you absolutely know that nobody will ever be able to do what they do to the same magical level. And these are only rehearsals.

As for the tour itself, it was so close to kicking off that we are lucky enough to see all the other elements it had to offer. A superb pre-filmed sequence that has MJ superimposed onto film with Humphrey Bogart ends in a machine gun fight which is a delight to see, its noir-ish atmosphere perfect for 'Smooth Criminal'  one of the best dance sequences on offer. Also pre-filmed (intended to be in 3D) is the ghoulish and ghastly 'Thriller' segment, a fun-filled lead up to Michael and co doing the uber-famous Thriller boogie. However, for a solo dance performance from MJ himself, nothing can beat his electric stand-alone routine for 'Billie Jean', the backup dancers and technical crew present stare on profoundly awestruck  as will you.

The documentary itself doesn't have much to do. Director Kenny Ortega, creative director of the tour and a close friend to Michael, knows that all we want to see is the man at work and he capably delivers. Ortega plays the music in an appropriate order ensuring there is a meaningful narrative to the proceedings but is thankfully never forceful in sentiment. Allowing the lengthy rehearsal sequences to play out, complete with MJ feedback and chatter, there is an added poignancy here that goes a long way to showing the world what was really lost on 25 June 2009. Not only an iconic, sometimes controversial, entertainer who was often viewed through a cynical lens but a genuinely affecting human being.

With only a limited two week run at cinemas around the world, I suggest you book tickets now to see this freakish talent in action. To miss this on the big screen would be a real shame.

Before you go to see this film please remember that it is made from footage of rehearsals. The footage is similar to that of Michael Jackson's rehearsals for previous concerts (Dangerous/History).

Michael's voice is amazing even though he mentions he is not going to go all out until the actual concert, it really shows he was 110% dedicated. He doesn't dance full on either, at times he does get into it but most of the time he is conserving himself for the concert.

It's all performances apart from a few interviews with the backup singers and dancer. There are also the intros for Thriller and smooth criminal.

For the non-fans that go to see this movie: It is not a concert film, its a summary of what could have been, and how hard Michael worked for it. It shows his humor and how involved, dedicated he was for his performances.

If you are a fan, you need to watch this.

As a lifelong Elvis fan, as opposed to a Michael Jackson fan, I have to say this film does MJ proud as a lasting legacy. There were two documentary films made about Elvis which, quite frankly, do not hold a candle to This Is It in style, scope, editing and footage. This Is It is a wonderfully brilliant homage to Michael Jackson. Granted it was done more for his own record and not the viewing public but thank God the powers to be decided to release it. I can only sympathize with MJ fans when they lost their idol (having gone through it 33 years earlier) but they have a wonderful film to remember him by. I went to see it because I quite like his music (like Elvis he had a God given talent) and I love dancing and I came out of the theater blown away by his professionalism, hard work, and attention to detail. From beginning to end, I was enthralled by the dancing numbers (Smooth Criminal rehearsals being my favorite) and the music. Fan or not, you can view this movie and appreciate his talent and he had it in spades. There is enough dance footage in this movie to satisfy dance fans and for Michael Jackson fans, there is more than enough to keep them satisfied. I came out of the cinema appreciating Michael Jackson much more than before I went in. I mourn the loss of his early demise and the talent that surely robbed the world of future projects. If the concerts in London had ever gone ahead, they would have been outstanding, no doubt about it.

Almost everyone around me is against seeing this movie. They only know what the media has fed them about Michael Jackson and don't want to just jump on the bandwagon now that he has died. I was scared to see this movie because I felt was contributing to Sony's profit off his death. Of course I had to see it anyways because I needed closure. The first thing I noticed is how "normal" he looked in the footage. From what the media presented to us I was expecting to see a frail & weak Michael Jackson on stage. I was shocked at how well he moved, how good he sang and how "normal" his face looked. He blew me and everyone away in the theatre I couldn't stop singing and dancing in my seat.. to me this movie was a celebration and victory for Micheal Jackson. Many people will look at it differently and focus on his appearance but if you look past it you will see his beautiful soul and relentless talent that is and always was Michael Jackson. I think that everyone who ever doubted him should see this movie and you will find that you have been lied to by the media. What I take most importantly from the footage was that he was not only going to give possibly the greatest performance the world would ever see.. but also he was going to use this show to express his love for the world and inspire people. After everything that he has been through in his life... the world turned against him and the media used the one thing he loved the most "children" to destroy him and we sat back and watched it happen. Why would he still care about the world after everything he had been through... I think because he stayed true to who he was from the beginning he never let the "evil" of the world change his heart. This is a true victory to me. I wont allow myself to focus on his death and possible murder because then I will remember his story as a tragedy and that's what the media wants us to do. Focus on a tragic icon who rose to the very top and came crashing down.. that's what sells. This is not the true story of Micheal Jackson if you watch the movie " the Jackson : an American dream" & "this is it" you will see that he overcame the struggles of his life and got back on the stage to perform his heart out because they didn't break him. This is how I will remember his story.

I want to point out some issues about the many pictures we saw of Michael before he died. As I photographer I know that we can easily manipulate the way a person looks through professional programs and make it look very real.. I used to wonder myself why he would wear the masks. Think about it.. thousands of photographers who were paid millions of dollars were always trying to catch a picture of him and they would manipulate his features and exaggerate them to make him look like a freak. By covering his face they couldn't do that anymore... so the media turned it and used it to make him look even more weird. Of course none of us "normal" people walk around with masks like that so we think it looks weird but we don't live like Michael Jackson in a world so secluded from having a normal life.. the media and fans made it impossible for him to ever be "normal." So why did we compare him by our own standards. I can point my finger at everyone else and say look at what "they" did to Michael Jackson but I am guilty of never really looking into things while he was alive. I always loved his music and what it stood for but I was ashamed so I would say " I don't care for his personal like but his music is amazing" and no one would dispute. No to say that I believed what the media presented about him but I never took the time to educate myself and stand up against all the garbage. I will learn from this and teach my children one day to stay away from gossip and especially the media.. and learn about person before you judge them. Most important I will teach them about the story of Michael Jackson and how he inspired me to be better person.

Well I was angry and sad when I finished watching This is it! But not because it was in some kind of way bad. not at all! I was angry because we won't be able to watch this beautiful peace of work that MJ was preparing to give us in this series of concert! I didn't listen to Michael's music before his death. I couldn't even understand why he has so powerful fan base. I just saw him in the way the press presented him to me. As a pedophile and someone who changed his skin color with a series of surgeries. I didn't even take a slice of time to really listen to his music and understand a powerful message that he tried to gave us in his songs. When he died I wasn't shocked at all but started to listen to his songs out of pure curiosity and you can tell that I was amazed. This movie shows all of Michael's haters (as I was before his death) his real side. A humble, loving person that loved us all no matter what. And he tried to give us all his love in this concerts.

Well, what can i say... See this movie! Just to say goodbye to a King. Or to understand why he is a King. Because that's what he is! King of pop!

After seeing "This Is It", I now understand why Michael Jackson's 50 shows in London were sold out in just hours. I saw this movie with no expectations, thinking that it was just a way for the studios and his family to make money, that it would be just a bunch of interviews and clips hastily thrown together to cash in while MJ was still in people's mind. It was not. The movie documents the months of hard work Jackson and the crew put in to prepare for the London concerts. In light of the amount drugs that Jackson had been on and his poor health, for him to be so alert, to dance so well, and to work so hard is mind-boggling. Throughout the movie, Jackson oversees the minutest details - slightly changing the beat on the piano, refining cues and positions. While I liked Michael Jackson's music in the past, my respect for him was tempered by his freakiness and many controversies. But after watching this movie, I have a whole new respect for him. You can see the talent oozing out of him. He knows his music intimately and works so professionally with his crew. He's famously eccentric, but he's also an extremely nice guy who was always courteous with his staff. I really regret not seeing Jackson's live shows in the past and am saddened that the world lost such an extraordinary talent. His songs have held up well after more than 30 years, and as one commentator noted, at the age of 50, he still blows all the top 10 pop singers out of the sky. I'm really surprised that the movie only got 7.9 million at the US box office, but I expect its sales to grow people who have watched the movie say great things about it. In China as well, the theater where I saw the movie was only about a quarter full (although I do live the outskirts of town...) Watch this movie and be amazed.

I am not one to watch concert videos. I am not sure I've even sat through an entire concert video and I still can say I haven't because I just couldn't make it through Michael Jackson's successful This Is It. I watched almost the entire thing before I gave up. I love Michael Jackson's music as much as the next person. I grew up with him, one of my favourite anthologies was the History album and I was shocked about his death as well. I suppose with all that and the hype that was and is Michael Jackson my expectations of his final concert/film were reasonably high. What I expected was some of his greatest music mixed with his charismatic and brilliant stage presence, musical genius and a majority of behind the scenes footage we have never seen, or could never see and that is where This Is It hits a brick wall. It hyped itself as 'behind the scenes', Michael's last days, and there is virtually none of that. The scenes are the most mundane, pointless moments in putting together this concert. The music is a mish mash of various moments in his career but nothing really moves you or shows you anything that really makes you want to see more.

It bodes well for the people who put together Michael Jackson's last concert that they hired a legitimate director like Kenny Ortega. Ortega's credits include a host of TV Shows and Disney musicals and I would have hoped he could have put together something with more than just clips and short snippets of music and more of a story. I guess I just wanted something that really just paid the ultimate homage to a man who is truly a musical legend. I wanted to be moved by his music the way he has always done but for me This Is It was a total dud and did none of that. At the same time this is strictly my personal opinion of the film because I know many fans and concert lovers adore this movie or at the very least enjoyed it so maybe I'm not the right person to review this. I score a 2 because it did so well and many love the film so they must have done something right. However, if you're like me and not a huge concert video person you might wanna steer clear and simply watch Youtube videos of Michael Jackson because then you can put together your own homage to the King of Pop. 2/10

Those of you who are fans will undoubtedly love THIS IS IT.(Although it most certainly will bring you some tearful moments) Those of you who aren't, will probably enjoy it a lot, despite any negative feelings or concepts you may harbor about Michael Jackson's personal life. Frankly, I was lukewarm about going to see it. Thanks to my wife Carmen's insistence, this outstanding work moved and inspired both of us.

Ever the consummate perfectionist, Jackson seemed poised to embark on a grueling 50 performance tour that, undoubtedly, would have served as the comeback/swan song to end all comebacks/swan songs?! This miraculously edited work (From over 1,000 hours of footage), apparently the brainchild of director Kenny Ortega, provides us with a direct window into the elaborate creative process of a true performing genius. What a show it would have been! Jackson was putting together a tour experience that elevated itself to near art form/near perfection. What a profound shame that it was never to be! 

A stunningly awesome international ensemble of world-class dancers, singers, musicians, performers, and technicians were assembled by this Tour juggernaut, ALL of them seemingly worshiping the ground M.J. walked on. Was there any foreshadowing of the looming ominous event that caught us all by surprise? A few chips in M.J.'s armor? Frequently, he apologized to all present for "Holding back and not giving 100% in order to conserve energy and save his voice." But then again, most of the other performers were 1/2 his age! One thing is for certain: There will be no more Michael Jackson Tours, nor new Michael Jackson hits to add to his long and impressive list. They are his legacy to all of us and have forever become part of our cultural landscape. I recommend you experience THIS IS IT in a good home- theater for full impact...

9* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! 

Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!

Say what you will about Michael Jackson in his personal life (many have, many times over), but it's hard to dispute his talent. Months before his very untimely death- he was about to put on a ten-show last-time concert in London- this collection of footage from his rehearsals shows undeniably that the guy could sing and dance and entertain even when he was just in front of the other awestruck dancers in his group. He was a strange guy behind closed doors, perhaps more (or less) than we think we know, but the footage that's collected here by director Kenny Ortega is, at the least, proof that there was fire burning in him to put on a show wherever and whenever and to do it to his maximum potential.

With This is It, it's a concert film mostly, and sometimes a documentary on the making of some of the background footage that would have been used in the concert. Some of the latter stuff is interesting to watch, though a little unsettling (i.e. a 3D remake of Thriller is sort of pointless as it's impossible to top the Landis original, despite the addition of never-before-heard Vincent Price dialog), but it's the stuff on stage with MJ perfecting his performances, and of those around him, that intrigue the most. Director Ortega (of High School Musical films) is not quite as adept at mixing together the video footage with the on-stage rehearsal. It usually works best when we see a song performed either just in its entirety on stage with MJ and the other performers (i.e. Billie Jean) or with the majority from video footage (Smooth Criminal, one of the highlights of the film due to its update with MJ in a Bogart movie).

Truth be told, I didn't enjoy the entire film, but it's mostly based on the preference of songs - I could have done without some of the slower numbers or ballads like Human Nature, I'll Be There or Earth Song - and it's not to discredit the real appeal of This is It. We get to see what it's like behind the scenes (save, perhaps, for some of the much more intense squabbles or whatever that were likely cut), with MJ's perfectionism knowing no bounds. He could basically direct the show himself, we see, and that Ortega is mostly used for directing the background dancers and pyrotechnics. A lot of your favorites are here, and he performs them in rehearsal with the kind of energy some bands and groups or singers barely ever have the energy to muster up.
