John Hawkes continues to amaze with his chameleon-like embodiment of unusual characters. This time, he plays Marc O'Brien, a 36 year-old polio victim who has spent his life horizontal in an iron lung. Based on a true story, O'Brien is a poet and a romantic, who has never had a sexual experience. After consulting his priest, ( William H. Macy perfectly embodies the Berkeley radical father), he contacts a therapist and hooks up with a sexual surrogate, Helen Hunt. Their "sessions" form the heart of this tender film, and take both the audience and Marc on a journey of self-awareness and discovery. Hawkes is simply amazing. He imbues the character with innocence, hope and wry humor in what can only be described as a tour de force performance. Hunt is equally skilled in her role, combining professionalism, playfulness, sensuality, and compassion in series of sessions which require full nudity. Both actors are courageous in their pursuit of truth and humanity and achieve Oscar caliber performances, thanks to the sensitive direction of writer/director Ben Lewin.

The niche subject matter will not be to everyone's taste but the handling of it by the artful Ben Lewin has been most skillfully and sensitively handled. The casting, particularly Helen Hunt, is ideal and Ben's subtle Jewish humour adds just the right touch to what could so easily have become a difficult story to keep on the move. As the film progressed I became increasingly intrigued by how it might end but it never loses interest and the combination of a tight script, good acting and very sensitive direction keeps the tension right to the end. Although a low budget production, it never feels like it and is vastly more satisfying than the big name run-of-the-mill rubbish Hollywood churns out far too often. This is a rewarding film in its own right and a valuable study into how tough life is for the seriously disabled. It provides a great service to everyone caught in such extreme circumstances and deserves success.

"The Sessions" is a sensitive and poignant film with an outstanding performance by John Hawkes as poet Mark O'Brien a childhood victim of polio that left him paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on personal attendants and an iron lung that enables him to survive the nights without suffocating. In voice and facial expression he manages to perfectly capture the life of a severely disabled man who likes to push against boundaries and retains a sense of humor--he tells someone that he believes in God because he needs to blame someone. This role is quite a departure for Hawkes who gave terrific performances in films like "Winter's Bone" and "Martha Marcy May Marlene" where he was Jennifer Lawrence's loner brother and a deranged cult leader haunting Elizabeth Olsen. Helen Hunt is memorable as the sex surrogate to whom O'Brien turns to help him achieve his dream of sexual intimacy with a woman. A professional as well as a wife and mother she doesn't hesitate to take exception with the notion that she is some kind of prostitute and clearly she isn't. William H Macy is the local parish priest whom O'Brien a devout Catholic relies on for advice and encouragement. There's plenty of wry humor watching Macy trying to figure it all out as he knows he's in uncharted waters. Based on a magazine essay director/writer Ben Lewin handles this unusual subject matter with great sensitivity and intelligence. This isn't some Hallmark TV movie it's a mature, honest film that isn't going to insult your intelligence. Definitely worth seeing.

The Sessions tells the inspirational true story of Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), a poet/journalist who has an iron lung and is paralyzed from the neck down due to polio. At age 36 he decides to finally lose his virginity and  with the support of his friend/priest (William H. Macy)  hires a sex surrogate (Helen Hunt).

John Hawkes (Winter's Bone, Martha Marcy May Marlene) has been gathering accolades for his performance in The Sessions  and with good reason. He not only delivers on the physical demands of such a role but he manages to encapsulate the emotions of a man with a broken body but a good heart. It's an impressive performance that should see him at least receive an Oscar nomination come next years awards. Hawkes is almost matched by Helen Hunt. She bares all in a brave role that depicts a woman struggling with her job and her emotions. These two performances are some of the best (so far) this year. William H. Macy also gives a good performance as a likable priest that O'Brien is able to confide in.

As a whole, the film doesn't shy away from much. The sex "therapy" sessions are depicted as realistically as possible and are both funny and touching (no pun intended). Ben Lewin's direction is simple yet it manages to adequately depict O'Brien's world without sensationalizing it. It's an all round simple tale that is well told. This is an adult drama that will make you laugh, cry and look more positively at your own life. There aren't many films that do that these days.

Been a little while since I've seen a film that's as touching and moving as "The Sessions" which is based on the real life story of a California man named Mark O' Brien. And it's certainly a little different O' Brien(in a top notch and excellent performance from John Hawkes)a poet and journalist is a man with talent, but tragically he's confined to an iron lung due to a kid bout with polio. Then at the age of 38 Mark has made the big decision to lose his virginity. This will be a big impact on Mark's life so he consults the advice of his ever honest priest Father Brendan(in a good supporting turn from veteran William H. Macy)who oddly enough gives a good hearted thumbs up.

This pleasure changing experiment will have to be done with the help of a professional sex surrogate and this lady is a strong and tough wife and mother who makes her living helping others enter Cheryl(in a strong and direct turn from Helen Hunt)who can make everything appear like she's the plain Jane girl from next door. Slowly but surely these encounters or sessions between her and Mark produce results of feeling, relaxation, mind changing, and comfort, all before they finally approach the pleasure point! Along the way this picture is told with honesty and much of the scenes are humor mixed with blunt and brash serious feel of a man being set free toward a new feeling of pleasure freedom finally! Overall the "Sessions" is a film of journey and it shows how the discovery of sexual pleasure can bring out emotional freedom that's touching and memorable even though the scenes are brash with skin and memorable and educational with thought. This film is a real inspirational winner and the chemistry between Helen Hunt and John Hawkes is in top notch form as director Ben Lewin made a real and true winner.

The Sessions (2012) 

**** (out of 4) 

Terrific adult drama about Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), a man who has been living in an iron lung since the age of six due to polio. At the age of 38 he confides to his priest (William H. Macy) that he wants to know the touch of a woman so he hires a sex surrogate (Helen Hunt). With a story like this there are just so many ways that it could have failed but writer-director Ben Lewin does a terrific job as do to the leads and in the end THE SESSIONS really turns into a touching movie. I really wasn't sure what to expect going in but this actually turned out to be a terrific character study through a group of sex sessions, which at first seemed like a far-fetched idea until you learn that it's actually based on a real guy and on the article he wrote. What makes the film work so well is that both characters are fully formed and it's especially important when it comes to O'Brien since we're going on this journey with his as he tries to deal with his disease and the physical limitations he has. The performance from Hawkes is so remarkable because he has to act pretty much just using his head. Since the majority of the film has him in the lung or under the covers, we mainly just see his face and hear his voice and the way Hawkes builds this character and his emotions is just something truly incredible to watch. It also helps that Hunt is so great in her role as she's pretty much playing the guy's teacher, lover and friend. The compassion she brings to the role is certainly something special and the chemistry between the two hits on all the right marks. Macy is also excellent as the priest bringing in some needed humor. Moon Bloodgood, Adam Arkin and Annika Marks are also great in their supporting parts. THE SESSIONS boils down to being a story about something with physical limitations and I'd say it's one of the better films to come from this sub-genre. The movie is funny but it's also incredibly touching as these two people slowly come together over a group of sessions. This is certainly a movie for adults as there's no trickery in the story but instead it just plays out in a mature fashion.

Greetings again from the darkness. In 1997, director Jessica Yu won an Academy Award for her documentary short entitled "Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien". Mr. O'Brien was a poet and journalist who attended Cal Berkeley. His story reaches the level of remarkability once you understand that he suffered the harsh effects of polio, was almost entirely paralyzed, and was confined to an iron lung for all but 3-4 hours per day. Director Ben Lewin (a Polio survivor) has taken a specific part of O'Brien's story and turned it into a very entertaining and intimate film that explores the challenges faced by the disabled in leading a full and sexual life.

In 1990, O'Brien had an article published: "On Seeking a Sex Surrogate". It detailed his desire to overcome the obstacles and experience a sexual relationship. He did so by working with Cheryl Cohen Greene, a Berkeley based sex surrogate ... also a wife and mother of two. This is the very touching story of how Cheryl (played here by Helen Hunt) worked with O'Brien (played by John Hawkes) to overcome his fear and anxiety. These sessions occurred after O'Brien "cleared" his plan with his Catholic priest (William H Macy).

This story is as frank and honest as you might expect, and it avoids sinking into Hollywood sentimentality for the sake of the story. The truth is plenty powerful. O'Brien's caregivers are played progressively by Rusty Schwimmer, Annika Marla and Moon Bloodgood. Cheryl's husband is played by Alan Arkin and Robin Weigert plays Susan, the woman with whom O'Brien had a loving relationship with until his death in 1999.

There are some similarities to the wonderful film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this story and these characters are much more accessible to the viewer. These are people with whom we care about and connect. It's a vivid reminder that living a full life regardless of one's constraints should always be the goal. Incidentally, Cheryl still works as a surrogate these days ... at age 68.

This is an absolutely superb film! If you see a trailer it won't show how brilliant this film is, the only way you can actually experience how good it is is by actually seeing it. The only way that it can be advertised to actually make you want to see it is word of mouth. I see loads of films each year and I can tell you as a true critic, not biased by any specific genre, this film is brilliant. It's original, funny, shows the true awkwardness of the situation and work with it. It's fun, no matter how serious the condition or serious the illness is. The guy is fun. The best line, "Are you religious?" "Yes, I need someone to hate and blame for my problems". It's so true!

The Sessions directed by Ben Lewin is based on the life of Mark O'Brien, a polio stricken man in an iron lung who was a journalist and a poet( played by John Hawkes: movie Winter's bone)originally from Boston who moved to Berkeley,CA. Mark was grateful that his parents did not send him to a nursing home but raised him at home so he could live long. At age of 38 ( 1988), Mark decided to lose his virginity and explore and enjoy sex. He was always supine and always either in an iron lung at home or on a gurney when outside. He finally decides to seek the help of a paid sex surrogate who is definitely different from a hooker. Cheryl(played by Helen Hunt)is a sex surrogate. Cheryl is intelligent, educated,married and has a nice body. Cheryl and Mark decide to go through six sessions of sex and self awareness. Cheryl makes Mark aware of his and her body. John Hawkes acted brilliantly . His facial expressions and glittering eyes are very enticing and evoke respect and sympathy. I particularly liked the way Mark describes his first session of intimacy: cleansed and victorious. Helen Hunt as Cheryl is excellent. All the nude scenes are sophisticated and stylishly done. William Macy as Father Brendan is excellent. Screenplay is excellent and conversations between Father Brendan and Mark are interesting. Oscar worthy for Direction,screenplay, best actor, best actress, best supporting actor roles.

Not a single false note struck by any of the cast in this gem. 

John Hawkes, an actor's actor, finds a new level, as does Helen Hunt which is saying something. Every time I see William H Macy I think he is (even) better than the time before, and this is no exception.

This beautifully constructed and rendered movie was written and directed by a guy that I have never heard of, and, I'm told, made for less than a million bucks. 

My guess is that we will hear a lot of him in the future.

It's a beautiful and inspiring story. John Hawkes is brilliant in his portrayal of polio-afflicted quadriplegic man, who's quite intellectual and charming. With just his facial expressions and dialogues, Hawkes charms you throughout the movie. Helen Hunt is flawless, as always, and pretty comfortably gets into the shoes of a sex surrogate. William H. Macy and Moon Bloodgood are amazing as the supporting characters; they have some of the best dialogues in the movie.

Mark O'Brien's story is intriguing, inspiring and quite moving. His intention to lose his virginity through a sex surrogate leads him to experience love, both physically and emotionally. Mark O'Brien's story proves that physicality doesn't play such a big role when it comes to affecting and attracting people, in the long run; intellect and charm are greater factors. He affects and attracts the lives of three beautiful women. 

The nudity and sex in the movie is not vulgar or erotic; it's more on the emotional and intimate side.

Some of the memorable dialogues from the movie include: 1> "I understand that even among non-believers, the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is 'oh God'". 2> Vera: "Today, they're working on simultaneous orgasm." --- Clerk: "What's that?"

As Betsy Sharkey from Los Angeles Times aptly says, "In a country that embraces cinematic violence with such ease but blushingly prefers to keep sex in the shadows or under the sheets, the grown-up approach of 'The Sessions' is rare."

Simply put, this film disregards almost every aspect of story-making. It feels like the writer and the director are complicit in their dastardly plot to sell a movie that functions under the guise of moral relativity and shocking content, but does little to actually challenge the audience. The main thing is that there is pitiable protagonist and he hires a sex surrogate, no judgment, but she's really just a prostitute, but you're supposed to question your policies on prostitution in order to appreciate his emotional need for affection. This is very valid, but the movie does very little to hit you in the stomach with that idea. I mean it really could have hurt if they tried harder.

There needs to be another character, the big-shot Hollywood producer who says "THIS is how you make a movie!" It's a shoddy job of adapting a person's life to the silver screen, and although it pretends to pull no punches (full-frontal nudity) it pulls all the punches. There's no serious drama; It's a comedic attempt at a tragedy. 

Notable in it though, are John Hawkes' and Helen Hunt's performances which are the most compelling bits of emotional realism. In other scenes Hawkes is usually being sarcastic and making jokes, but with a sense of humor that relies on him being seriously disabled, so to say the humor isn't great, but the content (the fact that his life sucks) makes it amenable because you're glad he's upbeat. 

Scenes with William H. Macy are particularly culpable of this pathetic comedy. Everything about the dialogue between the two is as natural as Macy's hairdo. Seriously look at Macy's hair, it's so stupid, I mean for a goshdarn priest; There has never been a priest with a hairdo like that. It may seem like I'm nit-picking here, but it's so absurd it angers me, and I'm not usually one to notice the cosmetic aspects of movies. Everything about their conversations feels contrived in order to convey Hawkes' rosy demeanor about the whole thing and justify his buying a prostitute.

All that said, the actual story behind the movie is a compelling reason to see it despite everything the director, writer and producer do to counteract its true appeal to human nature. And the acting by Helen Hunt and John Hawkes is moving. This could have been a great movie, but it just misses on so many levels.

The title to this review has nothing whatsoever to do with "The Sessions" - it refers to all those people who wrote reviews about "bad taste" and "porn" who clearly have little or no compassion and probably live in cotton-wool padded suburban houses and enjoy "normal" lifestyles of comfort and security. They make me sick!!

The Sessions is an extremely delicate story that all those wowsers would like to think doesn't happen in real life. Maybe some true justice would be if they had a child who was paralyzed and grew up never knowing what it was like to experience what it took to make them! SEXUAL INTERCOURSE!!! Yes, I said it!! But then, when I look at some of those mean, negative reviews, I notice that most of them are from women and I wonder how many of them are closet lesbians too afraid to stand up and be counted!

I suppose it depends on how one looks at such a sensitive situation as Mark O'Brien's as to how one sees it. What makes them think that such a person should be deprived of what he was clearly able to do with professional help. Does it occur to all those negative thinkers that having sex with a severely handicapped man might not be all fun and games? Amnd, more to the point, does it ever occur to them that, fortunately for such handicapped people, there are people who sincerely want to do something practical to help them? Obviously not! All they see is porn (and, truth be known, probably clandestinely watch it on the Internet when they think no one is watching!)

Yes, The Sessions IS a very different sort of movie But it is well portrayed with a sensitive balance between pathos and humour. If you think that Helen Hunt shouldn't be seen full-frontal naked on screen than don't watch this movie but if you have a desire to see a true story about a sad situation rescued by someone who CAN see past naked flesh and sexual discussion, I believe you will be well-rewarded.

You know, one thing that surprised me is how brave the whole cast was in producing such an unconventional film, given that the subject and the plot as a whole aren't for anyone. People who have handicapped people in their families feel the subject as a delicate issue, so this movie's impression may be a little different, depending on the spectator's personal experiences. It's admirable to see how courageous Helen Hunt was to play such controversial character, specially because she does some nude scenes in a non-traditional kind of relationship. Some scenes are unintentionally funny, such as when the priest has to listen to Mark's confessions involving sex, due to the fact that we all imagine fathers as very conservative people. In my opinion, "The Sessions" is a film that followed a different way of 2004's "Mar adentro", which turned out to be slightly better. However, some elements of the plot felt a little implausible to me, and it ended with some lack of strong moments, which are expected in a drama movie. Recommended movie anyways, even it not flawless.

This is a somber topic, a 30-something man confined mostly to an iron lung from having had polio back in the 1950s. That struck a chord with me, as I remember attending a high school graduation in the 1950s in my small hometown where one of the students was in an iron lung from his own bout with polio. 

But this one is a bit different, in this true story the man's mind was sharp, as well as his sense of humor, and a graduate of U Cal at Berkeley. He wrote poetry, he learned to use his mouth and a stick to punch typewriter keys or work a push button telephone. 

John Hawkes has the role of the crippled man, Mark , who was a hopeless romantic and seemed to fall in love with every woman that came into his life. He also wanted to experience a few things that had eluded him so far, the touch of a naked woman and actual sexual intercourse. He was NOT paralyzed, as he explained, his muscles just didn't work so the only thing he could move was his head. Plus his erections were apparently pretty healthy!

Mark happens to find out about Helen Hunt as Cheryl , who calls herself a sex surrogate. As she explains, a prostitute wants your repeat business, but a sex surrogate wants to see you for a maximum of six sessions. Thus the title "The Sessions." From some comments in the DVD extras this seems to be a product of 1950s and 1960s and beyond sex therapists Masters and Johnson.

Part of the humor in the movie is created when Mark goes to visit the new parish Priest, William H. Macy as Father Brendan . Mark is a devout Catholic and worries that he might be embarking on something sinful and seeks Fr Brendan's counsel. As Mark's sex therapy advances there are some interesting and humorous discussions between the two, inside the church building with the altar in the background.

Helen Hunt I suppose should be considered brave to do this role, because it involves more than one scene of full frontal nudity. But it isn't erotic nudity, she is very convincing as a "therapist." Plus she seems to be in fine form at almost 50.

I also enjoyed the role Moon Bloodgood played as one of Mark's caregivers, Vera. She also is very convincing and is made to wear round frame glasses in her role as a Chinese. In real life her mother is Korean and her father is Irish-Dutch, and she is a real "knock out."

Overall a very interesting movie.

One of Helen Hunts best.

Hunts empathy toward the inflicted man John Hawkes was touching, and moved me.

William Macy was brilliant, as usual. I enjoyed his performance, a truly gifted actor.

John Hawkes, what can I say, but he nailed it.

Director & writer Ben Lewin did a remarkable job telling a heart wrenching story.

Although difficult to watch if your an open wound of emotion like myself, be ready to cry. However I would watch it again. 

I have one spoiler, or more than a warning. Helen Hunt's character does appear nude. So if you are offended by nudity you might want to wait until it comes out on basic cable.

The emotional journey is riveting in this movie. 

I avoided specific's on purpose' as not to spoil it for a new audience.

This is my first review, I hope it helps this film to reach others.

The story touches on such rarely discussed subject, sexuality and disabilities, and takes it to one of the most extreme limits it can imagine. I really like the earlier dialog line: "I am a true believer. I believe in a God with a sense of humor, a wicked sense of humor, who created me in His odd image." The fact that dramatization of this movie include William H. Macy's priest character just makes all the utterly hyperbolic and paradoxical nature of this movie the more weird. Yet it kind of succeeded in keeping my curiosity about it, and to keep on watching. Not being a mere predictable, in my opinion this movie was able to do emotion play so well that it was able to steer from a pity inducing movie at the first minutes into one with a glimmer of hope, even though it's in a sense a wrong one. Helen Hunt goes all out to totality with this one in her older years of her career, while John Hawkes only acted out an average performance.

I didn't feel like the scenes went by too quickly, so much as they just focused on the wrong people... It was interesting how the sessions affected his intimacy with other people (Amanda, Vera, and even the girl he met at the end... Susan?) but instead we focus on the more sensational aspects, and his development as a human being kind of gets shortchanged because of it... It makes sex the center of everything, when really it felt more like sex was just the gateway that helped to open up corners of his personality that were previously closed off.

In a similar vein, having him fall in love with his surrogate also reinforced this, and was the wrong move for the movie, I felt (even if that's how it played out, in reality... ) It gives the impression that the emphasis should be on the person you get to have sex with, when really I feel like the companionship is the more important part of it. (I'm disabled myself, if that colours my interpretation of the movie at all, and I have had similar experiences to those depicted in the movie)

Now, technically there was nothing wrong with the story that was told, but I just feel like some tinkering with the elements I mentioned would have made the viewing more fulfilling, for me... We can't all get the movie we want, I guess! Still, what it does cover, it covers well.

Writer and founder of a small press which published works by disabled authors, Mark O'Brien, was struck completely disabled and iron lung- dependent by polio when he was young, and he has a goal: He wants to enjoy the pleasures of a woman before he "reaches his use-by date", as he puts it. The line is delivered by John Hawkes, who plays O'Brien, with both the sense of humour, and the sensitivity, which typifies the handling of the subject matter in 'The Sessions'.

Ben Lewin, whose work has been primarily in TV and documentaries, brings John Hawkes together with Helen Hunt in a screen partnership that has to be one of the most intimate and trusting I have seen between two actors for some time. Hunt was up for an Oscar for her portrayal of professional sex surrogate Cheryl, who takes on the task of helping Mark achieve his goal. Their encounters are beautifully played, with the balance of awkwardness, fear and joy well judged enough that you truly feel in the room. The scenes seem raw and real, and the result of the writing is one of a film which does not snigger, nor encourage sniggering, at the idea of sex on screen; there is a directness, and explicitness about the issue, which to my pleasant surprise, actually manages to underscore the importance of the emotional resonance of sex, and its importance in our life. It would be easy to imagine this simply becomes a dirty joke. To the contrary, the sex is not sexy, but rather functional; the conversations they have and the depiction of Mark's struggle with his journey to manhood, becomes touching. There is something in the way sex is explored that brings to mind what D H Lawrence was trying to do with his infamous classic; rather than nudge and wink, the story looks directly at what sex is and why it matters.

Frustatingly, the direction seems shy of delving into the personal relationships and history of Cheryl; it also seems intent on putting the female form on full show whilst never completely exposing the male at the centre of the story. If this was an artistic choice, I wonder what the aim was; one would assume, in fact, that as the story moves forward, both character would become more exposed. The film also struggles to bring a key character to life; Father Brendan, played by the ever reliable William H. Macy, never seems complete. It is hard to pin down why, because Macy does not do anything wrong, but there is something in the scenes featuring Mark and the priest, which despite some deftly delivered humour, feel tough to buy.

The heart of the film is that central relationship, though. Limited to six sessions, for obvious reasons, we watch an unusual, touching bond grow, and despite the hurried nature of the story arc, it makes 'The Sessions' worth your time.

This is probably a poor time to post, since I saw this film yesterday and it still hasn't left me. When you've been watching films for nearly 60 years, you think you've seen everything, but no, you haven't seen this; a film that brings together immobility, sex, religion and vulnerability. The cast play the piece with delicacy and charm, only it doesn't feel like a piece; it feels real. The characters are no throw back to people you've met before; they are fresh; there's a documentary feel. Not a wasted scene and no attention can wander. To talk about the acting is hard because no-one appeared to be acting. It is a memorable experience; one of those cinematic experiences you are grateful to be alive to experience. Yes, it's that good.

The Sessions brings to the screen the last years in the life of Marc O'Brien, a polio patient who decides to lose his virginity at age 38. To do that, he gets the approval from his priest, and hires a sex surrogate who will guide him in the ways of love. So far, a little unusual maybe but nothing that would make you go "why should I watch this?". You should for two reasons: the first one is the acting, starting with the criminally underrated performance of John Hawkes, who gives tremendous emotional depth to his character, a man prostrated for the rest of his life who manages to charm everyone around him, including the audience. Everyone else involved give very low-key, realistic and heartfelt performances: Helen Hunt and William H. Macy especially, but also the rest of the supporting cast. The acting is so good that at one point I forgot I was watching a movie and felt like I was listening to real people going through their experiences.

The second reason is the story itself. I did some research on line about the life of the real Marc O'Brien and the film is pretty accurate and consistent with the facts; Marc's life is nothing short of extraordinary, especially if you consider that the film is based on an article of his that he had to type with a pen in his mouth. The people he met, the relationships he formed and how he formed them, all that is part of a very uplifting story which truly happened and is not adorned to make it more Hollywood-esque.

All of the above elements make for a very satisfying movie-going experience which I can't recommend highly enough. Everyone I know who's seen the movie has shared my feelings and it's exactly what I'm trying to convey to you: go see it and you won't regret it.

Shocking that Helen Hunt took on this role, it posed a real challenge. Just saw her in "Twister" hours earlier and it was hard to make the transition. However, I am so glad she did this. Her acting skills in the tenderness, caring, and empathy department are unparalleled. The connection she established in such a short time frame, within a professional environment, was nothing short of amazing.

I related to his crippling disability and the limitations of life that he sought to overcome, albeit with humor and a great attitude. Anyone who has experienced this situation would not pass judgement on his need for intimacy and connection. His priest, the venerable Mr. Macy, was a total crackup and one that would never last in my congregation. San Francisco, love it or hate it, does embrace the fringe of society which includes those who don't fit in physically.

I actually learned something about setting boundaries, a tough subject to address with impact. I thought she was a bit rough addressing his sensitive concerns, but found her forceful nature made him calmer with her confidence. Talking so directly about physical intimacy is hard to do, especially when you are young, but is a challenge even in later years. I found her manner interesting and something to consider for future encounters.

I was surprised to find this film so deeply emotional. Most likely due to the extremely heartfelt acting, the tragic situation, the uplifting triumph, and the inspirational ending. High recommend for disabled isolated outcasts, those looking for a loving connection and a solid religious interaction.

Its interesting to see that extreme hardships brings for extraordinary abilities as well as people. This journey of love destroys all the limitations a human body poses to his ability to pursue, have & express/give love for himself and his partner. it also destroys our impatience as well as our very stingy perception towards sex. all this with that hint of classic humor, it made the completely horizontal, almost paralyzed protagonist irresistible. I just love Helen Hunt. I just love Helen Hunt, once was not enough. She portrays her character with such awesomeness. portraying the transition from a clinical approach of a therapist to a woman slowly falling for another man's charm. What a team!! What a movie!! hats off.

With The Sessions, Ben Lewis delivers an intimist and very sensitive movie about this man who is going to discover his sexuality and find love at the same time.

The excellent John Hawkes embodies the endearing Mark O'Brien with an undeniable accuracy and the quest of this character trapped in an iron lung is depicted with a sweet and sour tone and a lot of humour.

Despite the movie being pretty well made, it it still difficult to be really passionate about this story probably because of the slight lack of rhythm and the relative redundancy of the action.

However, The Sessions deserves credit for tackling in a beautiful way, and without any melodramaticism, such a difficult subject.

If the basic premise of this film--and/or several opportunities to see Helen Hunt in the altogether--interests you, THE SESSIONS should prove worth your while. There's relatively little here that's LOL funny, but the whole lighthearted tone of the film effectively conveys some serious musings on happiness and fulfillment, religion, guilt, and numerous other things. THE SESSIONS also treats the libido in general (and the male one in particular) objectively and compassionately, as well as responding to the question, "Exactly how important should sex be to us?" Some of the ideas are not entirely fleshed-out(no pun intended), but the film goes just deep enough in the areas mentioned.

Other considerations: 

--Excellent acting--by the supporting cast as well as Hunt and Hawkes --with ultra-realistic dialogue; 

--The irony of Mark(Hawkes) confessing and seeking advice from a presumably celibate priest is not lost; 

--Just knowing that this film is at least loosely based on a true story greatly enhances it; 

--The ending could not be any better.
