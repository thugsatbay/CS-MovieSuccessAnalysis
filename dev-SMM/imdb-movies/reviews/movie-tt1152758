### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I just completed watching this harrowing documentary and it is only now that, having got the time to catch my breath, I am able to review it.

To begin with, I'd recommend not reading any of the other reviews so that you start watching it with absolutely no foreknowledge, and so that the film gets the opportunity to have the impact that it is designed to have, which, in my opinion, would only be fair to the director. Therefore without revealing the story I would only like to mention that this is a documentary that the film maker has made in remembrance of his close friend and his family; and its a bloody good watch.

The direction is great and the best part is that this documentary is made in 'real time'; which means that events unfold as the film progresses. This is probably something that I've never experienced in any other documentary before, since most of them are made in retrospect. It makes its point clean and crisp and it will certainly not be a waste of your time and money.

The film progresses in a quick and efficient manner and the time just seems to fly. The film is narrated in a very smart way with plenty of smash cuts. This documentary plays like a big budget commercial Hollywood film and will probably have you glued right up to the last minute.

So its good stuff. If you get the chance to watch it I'd recommend it. If you don't, well that's just too bad.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never been affected by a movie as much as this. Ever since i saw this movie, I have not been able to get the story out of my head. The way Kurt uses home movies and interviews to capture the essence of Andrew is perfect. I feel like i know and love the Bagby family. The film takes you through Andrews life showing the people that he touched along the way. The quote that really stuck with me was when Clark said something along the lines of "What would life be if this one person never existed". This is very relevant because of this movie to this day Andrew is affecting the lives of people that he never met including mine. He has inspired me to really cherish the relationships that I have, because life is too short for petty things. I have never cried in a movie, but this movie managed to get me to cry within the first 20 minutes. I am not a movie critic so i do not know how to write a review, all you gotta do is watch the movie. You are doing yourself a disservice if you miss this beautiful tribute. Much love to the Bagby friends and family.

One of the pleasures of an all access pass to film festivals is the opportunity to be drawn to something by word of mouth. I was accidentally standing outside the theatre after the first viewing of this film at the Sarasota Film Festival. Everyone coming out was raving about it, a film that I had originally pegged as just another manipulative true crime documentary. Most had been crying like babies. My freedom at the venue allowed me to change from a viewing of Priceless to this film. I had no idea I was waking into a wall of cinematic fury.

To say it was staggering is inadequate. The impact of it all is in part driven by style. Though the form is a traditional overlapping story structure, the frenetic pace of the presentation creates a sense many times of 'too much information'. Mixed in however are some stylistic tricks that act as accent marks to move your perception to one place versus others. This moves your feelings in one direction or another within the time frame of larger movements of emotion that drive the story. The technique, though not unique, is applied in the course of a story that would seem to demand more subtly, however, it works wonderfully. Could it be that within this piece of time about a very personal tragedy a new documentary form emerges? 

But the story and the trek to get through it are what keeps you glued. I will not go into the morphology of the multiplex of stories here since it would ruin the impact. Leave it to say that constant unexpected change ups give one the feeling you are on a roller coaster of emotional complexity. The net effect leaves you nearly breathless and, as one sobbing young woman I convinced to see the film told me, in desperate need of water.

The film ends with a seemingly endless list of all involved, most at least tangentially affected by the event if not actually in the film content. As you absorb the story's impact, consider that the true theme of the film is to introduce you to this virtual community of people discovered by this young filmmaker who started with an homage to his best friend and ended up capturing something far more profound.

There are many moments where we try to take solace in the good that can come from the horrid. After viewing this, ask yourself that even though all involved would have wished for the events not to have happened, the emotional fulfillment exuding from this film may have left all surviving the better for it. This filmmaker's love letter to his vastly extended family that grew out of the tragedy and his odyssey documenting it make for the kind of things we most look forward to in the cinema.

It started out as a remembrance for a son about his father and it became so much more.

I saw this film Sunday and it still resides in my heart and haunts me. This is the first documentary I have ever seen that has drawn me in completely, and made me feel as though I am part of the story and a friend to the victim. It was a roller-coaster of emotions and there were quite a few teary-eyed people by the end. I feel I had to give it a proper review, but like many have stated, it's hard to do so without ruining the effect the filmmaker intends. This story pulls you along and unfolds as it does for our narrator, the filmmaker, Kurt Kunne. His story is personal because he grew up with the central figure, Dr. Andrew Bagby. 

Andrew's parents, David and Kate, whom I had a chance to meet with after the screening, are lovely people, and I instantly saw why they foster so much love and support throughout the film: They are genuinely kind people who give off a wonderful parental-vibe. They show so much love and hope in the face of almost insurmountable evil. You hold onto their love and hope through the last few minutes, and eventually you find what the narrator finds: inspiration.

The editing and the directing reveal a truly gifted filmmaker, Mr. Kunne, a superb storyteller, bounces back and forth between past and present events. He reveals what happens at several key points which leads us an ending you should rather just see than have me explain.

From what I've read there were several richly deserved standing ovations as the film ventured into the festival circuit. If you have a chance to see, "Dear Zachary," this film will be playing until Thursday of this week at the arc-light cinemas in Hollywood. The filmmaker, Kurt, said the film will be making a return to Hollywood in early November and shall be coming to New York City in late October, MSNBC will be premiering the film December 7th and the DVD shall go on sale some time in mid-FEBRUARY. 

I suggest everyone pays their money to see this film for the sake of advocacy groups and to support bail reform in Canada. Although the legal system in Canada is put on trial in this documentary, it reveals a real problem with our own justice system here in the United States, and how some criminals are given preferential treatment over victims and their families' rights. 

I cannot tell you how much this film has affected me. How truly inspirational I find David Bagby and Kate Bagby to be

Please support Academy caliber documentaries, with a strong sense of heart, and a great message of hope. This is a wonderful, albeit tragic and yet inspiring film.

Dear Zachary Dir. Kurt Kuenne ***** "Perhaps it's done already, perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story, that would surprise me, if it opens, it will be I, it will be the silence, where I am, I don't know, I'll never know, in the silence you don't know, you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on."-Samuel Beckett, The Unnamable That final sentence, from one of the great novels of all-time, works here as a description of the heart and soul of this film, the best I've seen all year. Kurt Kuenne sets out to find all there is to know about his murdered friend Andrew Bagby after talking with friends who knew parts about Andrew's life that he never told Kurt. Shortly after stating this endeavor it is revealed that the woman who killed Andrew is also pregnant with his son. Kurt then decides to make the film into a memorial to give to Andrew's son, Zachary.

This is a film that is a search for its filmmaker, a search which ultimately finds itself asking the most unanswerable of questions. The unfolding of the events surrounding the search cause Kuenne to revisit his approach, his interview subjects, and allows the audience a personal look into an artist trying to make sense of the impossible (in fact, the film was never meant to be released except to family members).

Nearly a decade in the making the film compiles years of interviews with dozens of people who knew and loved Andrew, as well as through a number of home videos. Part of makes this a stunning example of art as process, is the fact that Andrew starred Kurt's home made movies growing up, and we see footage from those films, where we see even then the use of film being used to make sense of the world.

The amount of footage, interviews, and information comes at you early and quickly. The audience becomes immersed in the lives of Andrew's family; knows the information when the family knows it, and experiences the events as if they were one of Andrew's friends. An outsider may have been tempted to manipulate the audience, but Kuenne's approach is earnest and admirably restrained. He obviously cares about his friends, and is nothing but charitable to them by his representation (or non-representation in some cases) in this film. That said, Kurt doesn't pretend not to be involved himself. He keeps in narration where he gets emotional. He lets you know that he is frustrated and furious, and that at times he doesn't know where to turn.

This is one of those rare films which is an experience. I cannot remember the last time I was so viscerally effected by a film. Not just in tears but going through a wide range of palpable feelings, some clear cut, some frustratingly ambiguous, and leaving me haunted, purged, shaken. The film allows us to experience with Andrew's parents a diverse and difficult range of emotions. You will be angry, sickened, hopeful, humored, devastated, inspired, awed, depressed, and everything in between. At times you'll want to throw up your hands and say: "I can't go on!" It shows us humanity at its most evil, yet, without being sentimental, shows us how life can go on in the face of incomprehensible horror.

I don't know if I've seen another film which so effectively conveys the impact of the loss of a human life. A shot early on in the film catches a quick glimpse of ripples in a water, and this film looks at those ripples instead of focusing on the initial cause of those ripples.

And in the end, when the film comes back to the filmmaker, on his experience and his journey, in a recap of what we've experienced with humanity in microcosm throughout the film, its a devastating turn which displays the brilliance in the film's structure, despite it appearing a bit haphazard on the surface, all along.

I don't know whether to tell you to read more about the film or not. I've tried not to tell too many details because for full effect, and to do justice to the filmmakers experience you need to let this film wash over you. But I also don't know if some of the more sensitive viewers will make it through this film unprepared. Maybe this will suffice: this is not an easy film; the best never are. But like Becket's Trilogy, by looking through at life through the most hopeless of situations, somehow those who experience the work come out stronger, more human. Victor Frankel's early title for Man's Search for Meaning was "A Case for Tragic Optimism." That is this film.

I cannot praise this heartfelt documentary enough. Too often documentaries with such a personal tie have touch (or more) of vanity. Not Dear Zachary.

Kurt Kuenne could have easily turn this tribute to a dead friend into a vanity project, or overly sentimental. The evolution of this project is full of sentiment, indeed, but is done so in such a way that the viewer is completely engaged in the story and feels the loss on a personal level.

This is the hardest film to review because to explain it, is to spoil the experience of it. Let's just say that Andrew Bagby was a very loved person, and this tribute to a man whose life was brutally cut short could have easily been a depressing, dark tale. Instead, while it has some wrenching moments, it's ultimately a love story of family and friends, and the powerful influence people can have in each others lives, for good and for ill.

If you have the opportunity to catch this film, do not hesitate to do it. This is one I'm adding to my DVD collection as soon as it's available.

It makes me sad to see people criticizing "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father" for its technical limitations. I rented knowing only it was about a pregnant woman who killed her ex-boyfriend, the subsequent plight of the victim's parents and their agonizing efforts to win the custody of their grandson, Zachary (whose mother was released on bail). But the whole story is so unpredictable - and devastatingly sad - that the less you know about it, the better.

Writer/director/producer/composer Kurt Kuenne was a close friend of Dr. Andrew Bagby, who was killed by a psychotic woman, "Dr." Shirley Turner, right after he had broken up with her. He decided to make a final film with his childhood friend Andrew, and when they learned Shirley was pregnant with Andrew's baby, whom she named Zachary, it became more than a tribute to a friend, but a project to show Zachary the father he would never get to know. With Shirley at large, however, their nightmare wasn't over.

With such a tough, emotional subject, it would be easy to get overtly sentimental, but Kuenne does a terrific job. The film is obviously a very personal project, and visibly no-budget, but that's not an issue because this is not a film meant to be visibly stunning. Apparently, some people are way too cynical to appreciate a film for its heart and content rather than focusing on its aesthetics and "artiness". It had a much bigger effect on me than the last Oscar winner for Best Documentary, "Man on Wire" (a fine film itself). Had this film been directed by, say, Michael Moore, it would have been more incendiary and garnered larger media attention, but wouldn't have been half as passionate, compelling and, most important, honest. 

Kuenne uses the cinematic tool to document history, make a tribute for beloved friends (not only Andrew and little Zachary, but also Andrew's parents, David and Kathleen, the emotional core of this story) and to instigate the audience, both emotionally and intellectually. When most movies that get a wide release don't even attempt either of these goals, this is a remarkable achievement. Not to be missed. 10/10.

Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is easily one of the most traumatic films I've ever seen. Its not technically the most impressive documentary film, but the subject matter is powerful-enough that you cannot help but be deeply impacted by the story. I've hesitated to suggest it to a few of my more fragile friends because it is one of those films that can leave you in an emotional funk for days afterward. Its that powerful of a film, but not for the faint of heart. I personally would not watch it again, though I'm grateful that the filmmaker stuck with the project through it all and did not give up, as many would have. I'm grateful this story was told, even if it was painful to experience.

Wow, I certainly wasn't expecting it to be this overwhelming. It's the emotional equivalent of having your head kicked in against the curb. 

I thought I knew where the story was going but I couldn't shake the sense of sinister dread. I didn't think the story could get any bleaker but then... Maybe I'm doing it a disservice but I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who isn't in an already too fragile state. Because once you invest your own emotions in the story, you are screwed - within minutes I went from sad to angry to shocked and depressed and back and forth etc. 

That's quite an achievement. Yes, the film is flawed but you know what? I don't mind that films are flawed, it's the emotional punch that I'm going for. The film is made by someone on a mission (albeit a confused one at times) but the end result is a film that is raw and intimate.

Oh, there is a special place reserved in heaven for all the Bagbys. And a special place in hell for the murderer and the judge who set the murderer loose.

It's not fair. It's shocking, and If you have a Netflix account it is essential that you sit down and spend an hour and half watching the documentary DEAR ZACHERY: A LETTER TO A SON ABOUT HIS FATHER. I mention Netflix because it is part of their watch instantly section and I can say without a shadow of a doubt: you need to see this film.

Directed by Kurt Kuenne, it's a story about him on a quest to make a movie for Zachery Turner whose father, David Bagby, was brutally murdered by his Mother. When the Canadian courts let her go on bail it turns into a story of his Grandparents fighting to stay in Zachary's life. These Grandparents never give up. But mostly the story is about the people we leave behind and the legacy that we leave in their hearts. If you think your life is useless, if you think you haven't made an impact on the people around you, then think again. This movie pulls you in at the beginning and doesn't let go.

To tell you anymore about this story is to ruin the emotional impact of a film that will leave you in tears, and thanking God for the people around you. In 90 minutes I laughed, cried, was made numb, angry, philosophical and by the end I rejoiced in the beauty of the human spirit. I saw through some very dark turns that love can conquer all. But more importantly I learned the giving up is never an option and that it's our duty to help those in need.

The film begins with some cheesy computer graphic logo, and the moniker MSNBC Films presents and maybe that's what caught me off guard. I almost turned it off right then and there. But by the time it's over the cheesy little touches made the film feel like it was made by real people and not slick Hollywood documentary film makers. It feels like one of those photo montages at a funeral, or a wedding. It a small snapshot into the lives of of people ravished by tragedy and it ends on a bittersweet note that for once shows the power of real life.

DEAR ZACHERY is one of the most powerful and moving documentaries I've ever seen. It's an emotional film that will leave you angry and yet hopeful. It tells a story that can't be made up, it rejoices in the best of people, during the darkest periods of their lives. I've seen thousands of films in my life and DEAR ZACHERY is a rewarding film, that does what all great films do. It makes you rejoice in the human spirit and demands that if we see something wrong we fix it. Please see this film, I promise you won't regret it.

Voyeurism is a funny thing. Watching other people's little dramas or lives may seem boring at the outset, but often times it can be just as interesting, if not more so, than anything a big studio can come up with. With "Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father," we as an audience get a glimpse into a man that we otherwise would never have known. And after viewing this film, I have to graciously thank writer/director Kurt Kuenne for this.

After the murder of his lifelong best friend, Dr. Andrew Bagby, filmmaker Kurt Kuenne decided to go and interview everyone who knew Andrew in order to give his late friend's soon-to-be born son a way to know his father. But unbeknownst to anyone, this film would turn into something completely different.

Reviewing this film is difficult. For one thing, no one had any idea where this film was going (Kuenne, who narrates, openly admits this, although no one could possibly imagine what was going to happen). But more importantly, this film has something that many films don't: passion. It has a voice. This film will make you laugh, cry, scream in both terror and anger, and so much more. Even the most politically, one-sided films do not speak to the viewer like this film. In that sense, this film is a masterpiece.

But, on a critical scale, it comes up a little short. For me, the most effective bits were the interviews about Andrew. Those were funny and touching. Even if it added a few extra minutes to the running time, it would have been worth it. I felt like I could have watched a whole day's worth of interviews about Andrew. But the film gets into the struggle between Shirley Turner, Andrew's ex-girlfriend and probable murderer and Andrew's parents, who are trying to seek custody Andrew's son, Zachary. The film sort of loses focus at times, and it really inhibits Kuenne's goal in letting us know who Andrew was. At the end, it almost seems like a piece of propaganda (see the movie and you'll understand). Judging by what happens, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but still. Of minor note, the film only shows the good things about Andrew. Not that Kuenne turns him into some sort of flawless figure (Bagby does that himself), but it would have made Bagby seem more well-rounded.

Yet I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It introduces us to a wonderful person, and his name was Andrew Bagby.

First of all, I am friends with the parents of the doctor who was murdered by his ex-lover. This documentary was made by a friend of the victim, with whom he grew up, and who is a respected filmmaker in his own right.

The miscarriage of justice in attempting to extradite (from Canada to the U.S.) the woman who murdered the doctor is difficult enough to comprehend, but there are yet other complicating factors, such as her having her victim's baby and the attempts of the baby's grandparents (parents of the victim) to obtain custody of the baby.

The film is staggering, and the filmmaker does not spare the viewer's emotions. It is brilliantly filmed and edited. The movie was premiered in the U.S. at the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah, then showed in San Jose, CA at the Cinequest, and is going on to the South by Southwest Festival in Texas. If you have a chance, check out this film--it's not particularly uplifting, but it portrays a very real problem with our justice system, not only Canada's.

Non-fiction and me, we don't generally get along. Not that the truth is something I try to avoid, I just usually find documentaries too much like a school lesson, teaching rather than entertaining. Film to me is a medium that I use to go to different worlds, to be shown something new and exciting. Fiction as a rule, even if based on real events, is usually made more emotionally accessible and shown less analytically, to hit home stronger. However, every once in a while something will come out that truly astounds me, a tale that touches me on a gut level where the story transcends the monotonous narration and still frame photo after still frame photo. Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is just that experience. The last thing I want to do is ruin any of the twists and turns taken by this true life account delving into the death of a beloved man, so this review may be vague. On those same regards, though, I also want to recommend not finding out the facts yourself before viewing. If you let the document play out, slowly uncovering its own secrets while you discover them too, the impact will hit so much harder. But, if a swift kick to your heart isn't what you're looking for, by all means read up on the case. It's just that that punch is what makes the film so powerful.

Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne set about making this documentary in order to collect all the memories of his slain friend, Andrew Bagby, before the people he was to interview forgot them. He travels to England to retrieve stories from Andrew's mother's family there and then sets off on a cross-North America trip to visit everyone who held a special place in their heart for his friend. Between family, friends, and co-workers, the documents captured are truly moving. It's a stunning portrait of this man that was loved by all he met. Descriptions range from how you'd feel you could trust him with your life upon first meeting to how after spending fifteen minutes in conversation, you'd feel as though you knew him longer then people you'd known twenty years. Bagby's was a life cut way too short, and the reverberations of his death literally shook the world, it's tremors spanning two continents, three countries, and countless people.

A staple in Kuenne's films from grade school, Andrew was a self-deprecating young man, always striving to be a success in the medical field. He did what he had to do, moving to Newfoundland for medical school, after being rejected from all schools the year before, and eventually settling in Pennsylvania to put down his roots. After finding that surgical medicine was not for him, Bagby stumbled upon a family practice that allowed his affable nature to come through in force. The consummate people-person, he excelled at his job, saving lives and touching them for the better. After only a couple days, one co-worker spoke of, people were already requesting to be seen by him.

Of course, this rosy glow being set around him is an obvious thing to occur. No one wants to say how horrible his friend was after he has passed. The beauty of the film is that one, every account is so genuine that you will believe he was a saint, and two, the course of events that transpire after his murder become so horrifyingly unbelievable that you will be glued to the screen waiting to see how it all ends. Thankfully Andrew had so many friends close to him, because without that line of communication no one might have known the truth of that fateful night. When an ex-girlfriend shows up at his door wanting to meet and talk, Bagby calls a friend to share the news about how "you'll never guess who showed up at my house". When that friend warns he should go out the back and call the police, that no one would drive fifteen hundred miles to see an ex without reason, Andrew just laughs and says "why?" He was such a loving and trusting person that he'd never comprehend the horrors living behind some of humanity's eyes. Monsters do exist and this film will introduce you to one of the worst.

On the other hand, though, it will also usher into your knowledge the existence of angels. Bagby's parents, David and Kathleen, are the kind of people you wish were in your life. Upon the discovery that their son was about to have a child himself before he died, the two quit their jobs and moved to Canada to try and be a part of his life  especially since his mother was the supposed killer of their Andrew. Watching the events that happen concerning the extradition case to get Shirley Jones back into the US to face criminal charges is impossible to comprehend. The sluggish judicial system and lax care on the safety of individuals, (if someone is deemed not a threat to society, they may walk free because they have already killed the one person they wanted to killnow that's sound logic), will leave you speechless. It got to the point to where in order to be a part of their grandson's life, David and Kathleen had to visit him with his mother. They had to make play-dates and play nice with the woman who murdered their son. How they could have done that is a testament to their love for both Andrew and young Zachary, but once you hear David's account of their "options" you will see that they did look into alternative methods. When the many twists and turns rear their head, Kurt Kuenne could have easily given up on his work. But the idea of commemorating his friend kept him going and I am very glad he did.

Boy oh boy, this is a hard one to watch. For the rest of my life I have a baby's face indelibly imprinted into my heart. I can't shake this documentary; I am certain that I am not supposed to. My heart as well as my rage goes to Andrew and Zacharys loved ones, especially Mr and Mrs Bagby. I swear to God I will think of you always. Your bravery and love is overwhelming to me. I swear I would have broken if I were in your shoes. And I hate her too. I can't be nice about it at all, I hate her and what she did. Wicked, evil, beyond contempt. And as for those judges, may God have mercy on them, because if I they have no mercy from me. I am ENRAGED! What I do know is, it that you are so very strong. I am overwhelmed by the two of you. And I am CERTAIN that you have saved so many others lives by giving yourself to this cause. Another promise, even though I am having a real hard time praying to God right now, after seeing this Documentary, because I am so enraged, I swear, tonight I drop to my knees and pray for all of you. With all of my heart, I promise

Having just experienced the joy of Kuenne's most recent film "Shuffle," I sat down with this one expecting a sad but warm'n'fuzzy (and obviously personal) account of friendship and loss. And that's what he set out to make. But who knew that such Real Evil exists in this world, and that his tale would turn into one of Horror that would leave me intensely depressed, angry and shattered? This a mighty, mighty difficult journey to take, but it's personal, independent filmmaking at its absolute zenith, and was worth the extra dose of Clonazepam I needed to get through it. Kuenne is quite the multiple threat...the brilliant editing that hammers the bigger moments home with unbearable ferocity is his, and the trenchant music score is his. This is an Important Talent, and I'll be in line for whatever he does next. And may I say to Mr. Kuenne that I'm so sorry that life dealt you, as well as Dr. Bagby's wonderful family and circle of friends, such unspeakable horror.

There are many documentaries that are better than this one, specifically from a technical stand point. The biggest shortcoming on this film is the poor editing. It was never meant to be released theatrically, it was meant for the family it focuses on, so there are forgivable aspects, but it is indeed distracting to watch the film with distracting editing choices. Parts of the film do feel really messy and quickly put together. 

The subject matter on the other hand is one of the most heart wrenching things I've had to watch. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion and you sit there, helpless with nothing to do. The film is about Andrew, a 30 year old male who was shot to death, 5 times, from his ex-girlfriend. The filmmaker, one of his best friends, decided to make a film dedicated to the memory of his friend. Along the way they discover that the ex-girlfriend was 4 months pregnant with Andrew's child. Now the film switches focus and becomes a "letter" of sorts to Zachary (the child) about the father he will never get the chance to meet.

That's only a fraction of the emotional core of the film. I have nothing but utter respect and disbelief in the strengths of Andrew's parents, for what they chose to go through in order to be apart of Zachary's life. The director manages to showcase Andrew enough to make it seem like the viewer knew him by the end of the film. I have to hand it to Kurt (the director) as well, he goes to great lengths to speak to and film every person that had some sort of involvement in Andrew's life. His family, his friends, his co-workers, etc. He goes on a cross country trip to track down these people and talk to them. 

There was undoubtedly hours upon hours of footage to splice together and as I mentioned before this film was never meant for theatrical release. So the entire production was done by Kurt. Every aspect he had control over and it's a heavy task. His relationship with the subject matter makes the doc extremely subjective. Yet with all the evidence presented, is there another way to look at it? 

An abundance of emotion overcame me while watching this documentary. The two that stood out to me was sadness and anger. The filmmakers shortcomings from his technical aspects isn't a deterrent to the overall film. I say that everyone should go out and seek the film. If you have Netflix, it's available. It's a must see film.

The last time I cried in any movie was a few years back at the end of The Green Mile and that was a good 5 plus years ago and the time before that was probably The Lion King when I was 7 so it's fair to say that it's quite rare for me to get all emotional during a film. This film though had me blubbering like a schoolgirl who had just lost her favourite teddy.

Dear Zachary follows the true story of Andrew Bagby, a medical resident who was murdered in 2001 shortly after having broken up with his girlfriend Shirley. She then announces she's pregnant with Andrew's child which leads his closest friend Kurt Kuenne to make a film about Andrew as a gift to the child so he will know what his father was like whilst he was alive.

The documentary jumps between these past events and the present in real time so we find out what is unfolding at the same time as the family and friends. The film can be very fast paced and a bit full on especially at the start but this tends to immerse you into the life of Andrew and his family and you become one of them rather than this approach inhibiting the story. There is a lot of focus on Andrew's parents, Kathleen and David, as they go through the emotions of not only coming to terms with the loss of their child but also the challenges in seeking justice for the murderer and fighting for the right with Shirley to see their grandchild.

This movie perfectly sums up an emotional roller coaster ride as the emotions I felt varied wildly from sadness to anger, frustration, hope, inspiration, humour and everything in between whilst watching it. I found it even more intense because I knew nothing about the case or this movie coming into it and I recommenced that if you can keep curiosity under control (don't even watch the trailer below) to watch it without prior knowledge of what happened, hence why this review might be slightly vague in places.

The fact the documentary is personal to Kuenne brings about a certain objectivity that could not be achieved by another film maker. We get an insight into their life as they grew up in the form of home made movies they did together and family occasions. In some cases this is beneficial as he knows his subject matter better than anyone while in others it's less so as we meet Andrew, the man who has done no wrong in his life (but this bias is understandable, especially considering the intended viewer of the documentary).

Movies are supposed to elicit an emotion from you and for this fact alone, Dear Zachary was able to climb its way into my category for one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Granted the technical film side may not be the best you are ever going to see but boy it has a story to tell and it's well worth listening to.

Dear Zachary is a documentary, and there is a fallacy about documentaries that this one proves wrong- that they are all logic and lack heart. Kurt Kuenne has made a documentary in a way that a film itself is made, with amazing editing patterns and with a story that really grabs you and moves you. Yes, this is a sad film, but the reason a documentary like this is able to move someone so deeply is not just because it's real, but also because of the craft of the filmmaker. He is trying to make an actual memorial to these people and no words or facts will capture the true horror of a true life event as honestly as what he has created with music. The film plays out very much like a thriller, drama, and tragedy all at once.

Now, to the actual events in the film- horrifying. Of course, the film also takes a look at the unbelievably flawed legal system in Canada, but it makes one wonder. Why? Why? Why? To be honest I have never been fond of Canada and the film might play out like an attack against it but my personal feelings can't be kept inside. It is enough to truly make you hate the country. I just hope the film also makes people notice, which is the point of an actual documentary. 

I usually dislike emotionally-manipulative films, but films like this when are well made cannot be disregarded. As a documentary it succeeds amazingly well.

I love documentaries because they show unbelievable stories happening to real people. Unfortunately sometimes everyone's worst nightmare can come true & this is the story of a good man who was murdered and the horrible criminal injustices that continued to follow after his death. I have seen hundreds of movies & documentaries over the years but this film affected me more than anything I've seen before. I was blown away by all the love from Andrew's friends and how important he was in their lives. The awful events that happened to him and his family totally broke my heart. I admire Andrew's parents so much for the love they showed to their son, grandson & battle for justice. I came away from this documentary wishing I had known Andrew & had friends like his. I'm sure he would have been very proud about all the tributes they gave him and his parents. The director Kurt Kuenne also deserves praise for making a wonderful documentary that will keep Andrew's & Zachary legacy alive forever.

I just watched this documentary and I'm so, so....overwhelmed, impressed, sad, angry en full of hope.

The film itself is beautiful made. It is perfect the way it is. The quality, the editing, the music.. It did not need more 'stuff'. No, I am no filmmaker but it is just so pure and that was exactly what this story needed, something pure.

I am so sad for 'Bagsby' and his little, cute son he is now comforting, they are together somewhere I hope. Zachary looked so much like my youngest daughter who is 17 months now so I was falling madly in love with the little boy on my TV. And then he died. The woman who gave him life ended it. I did not see that coming, strangely enough, and I was deeply shocked. Sweet, sweet boy...I hope you rest in peace in your dad's soft and caring arms <3

After sobbing for half an hour I did see hope though, what a beautiful people are the Bagsby's and what a beautiful people are all of their friends. The world has beauty in it because of people like that. Keep strong, keep fighting and keep remembering. 

Kurt, you made a perfect film that touches lots of hearts I think and although it would be so much better if you did not need to make this film, I truly feel there is a reason I saw this today. Thank you very much.

Whether or not you are a parent, as long as you are a functioning human being, the documentary Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father will tear a hole in your heart so wide that you can drive a truck through it. Dear Zachary was written, produced, and directed by Kurt Keunne in tribute to his childhood friend, 28-year-old Dr. Andrew Bagby, who was murdered in November, 2001 by his girl friend, Shirley Turner, an emotionally disturbed woman twelve years older than him. After the couple had broken up, Shirley had purchased a gun, then drove from her home in Council Bluffs, Iowa to Pennsylvania to meet Andrew that night in the park, where she shot him five times.

The film, originally intended for Andrew's son Zachary as a picture of the father he would never see, is both a love story, a crime story, and a horror story, and one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen. While the film is a passionate cry from the heart, it is also very angry and disturbing, and is not recommended for a family with small children. Shot like a home movie, with photos, home movies, interviews, news footage, and recording of telephone conversations, Dear Zachary is a wild ride with cuts so fast it will make your head spin. When the director discovered Andrew's interest and skill in photography, he realized that there was much in his friend's life that he hadn't known about and set out on a journey throughout the United States, interviewing people who knew his friend.

We hear testimonials about the kind of person Andrew was from people who knew him from the time he was a child to the time he graduated from Medical school and became a doctor doing his residency in Latrobe, a small Pennsylvania town. Friends recalled Andrew as the gregarious, well-loved individual who starred in Kuenne's earliest attempts at filmmaking. As events unfold, the focus of the film shifts to Andrew's parents, David and Kate Bagby, whose emotional resilience in the face of continuing tragedy is remarkable. Kuenne is deeply involved with the family and often portrays his subjects as being somewhat larger than life but he never claims to be objective.

Kuenne tracks the events leading up to the murder, the actual killing and the investigation, and the ensuing custody battle when the accused killer gives birth to a son Zachary after fleeing to St. John's in Newfoundland, Canada. What he could not have known was to where the tragic circumstances would lead or that the Canadian judicial system would fail to protect the family. Shirley, accused of first degree murder, was let out on bail pending her extradition to the United States using the twisted logic of Justice Gale Welsh who said that Shirley was not a danger to the public because she already had killed the one she targeted and would be unlikely to kill again.

As we reflect on the tragic shootings in Arizona and the call for healing, the film's rage against the Canadian judicial system and hatred towards the accused killer, while understandable in the wake of unspeakable loss, dehumanizes Shirley to the point of being called "pure evil" and "the devil". More valuable would have been to begin the process of forgiveness and letting go, to consider events in the context of a purposeful universe, and to find hope even when circumstances dictate otherwise. To their credit, however, David and Kate became political activists in Canada after going through their traumatic journey, fighting for stricter laws against sociopaths. The couple's long fight for legal changes in Canada ended recently with a new law that changed the Criminal Code, allowing courts to refuse bail for suspects accused of serious crimes when a minor is involved. For the first time in years, David Bagby and his wife Kate decorated their home this past Christmas.

Although I would agree that the documentary recounts a sad story, I had heard about the story in the news, so I knew how the story ended. Without giving the basic plot of this documentary away, it's a very sad and sometimes frustrating narrative. The story of the way the justice system worked with regard to a local woman, Shirley Turner, in St. John's, Newfoundland sounds pretty stupid on the part of most of the lawyers and judges involved in the case. Nevertheless, as a documentary this is an awful piece of filmmaking. The story involves the murder of a young American man, Andrew Bagby, by a Canadian woman from Newfoundland, Shirley Turner. 

The director was a childhood friend of the deceased and part of the narrative is the journey literally taken by car from California to Nfld. by the director/filmmaker. Along the way the director meets friends of the deceased and there is even a few moments given to mourn the death of a relative of the deceased from cancer. Why? Because he was a relative of the deceased and a hell of a nice guy. The documentary criticizes the problems with the justice system in St John's, Nfld. that affect the murder case and later events. But there is absolutely no attempt to research this topic besides some scenes purporting to be cold calls to some of the lawyers and judges. We view the story largely through the eyes of the director and the parents of the young American man. 

Thus the film is basically a moral condemnation and denunciation of the woman Turner. But what struck me in the end was that the woman who murdered Bagby was seriously ill. I am not excusing this woman, but in the end it is quite obvious to me that she was just being who she was, a seriously disturbed and potentially violent person. Therefore, despite all the best of intentions of the filmmaker and the friends and family of Bagby, the anger, hostility, and moral condemnation against a person who was obviously mentally disturbed creates a strange effect on a film supposedly made to show love for the deceased Bagby and a child who was possibly his son (considering the erratic behavior of Turner, I wondered if anyone actually ever verified whether the child was Bagby's for certain). 

Turner was a sick person. That goes without saying. But in the end the hostility towards her just seems to me to show that those involved, including Bagby's parents and the filmmaker himself, were "infected" by the horrible person named Turner (truly the movie's "villain") so that they too end up as spiteful and antagonistic as Turner. In other words, everyone plays along with Shirley Turner. With a disturbing atmosphere of self-righteous and un-self-conscious aggressivity, the film attempts to gloss over emotions of violence and hatred. But by hating Shirley Turner so clearly, the film asks the viewer to participate in the same emotions of manipulation and twisted emotionality it condemns in Turner herself. 

I felt at times that the use of repetition of some of the clips was truly in bad taste. The closing words of a letter "Love Kurt" cannot hide the pure hatred and revenge the film perpetuates. I suppose if the purpose of the film is to vent and spew hatred against a mentally deranged person, "Dear Zachary" is a success. Personally, I found it awful that they would ask one of Turner's own children from a previous relationship to come on camera to castigate a mother who probably left him long ago. 

But everything is fair game since it is after all for Andrew Bagby, then for Zachary, and finally for the Bagby parents, those loving grandparents who decided that their son lived in the child carried by Shirley Turner, a disturbed, violent, psychopathic woman who wanted to be recognized so much, even of it meant making those around her want to kill her. And they do.

No Spoilers.

This documentary is truly a labor of love. This death prompts a close friend to try and document (to his friends unborn son) who his father was and why so many people loved him. You really get to know this victim and are sad that this happened. This death is not an ordinary situation and we encounter many twists and turns along the way. Even though it's a documentary, you really aren't sure what is going to happen next. The drama is thick and the reality of death, keeps punching you in the gut. I can't reiterate enough how well this story (for better or worse) will resonate with you. I hope you will take the time and watch this documentary, it's well worth the time invested.

What begins as a quest to learn more about filmmaker Kurt Kuennes murdered friend, Andrew Bagby, ends up becoming a tribute to Andrew's parents David and Kate. This is a poignant and gut-wrenching story of love, loss, betrayal, and the will to endure. Im finding it difficult to accurately describe the emotional roller coaster this film takes you through; and while its a sad and difficult journey for David and Kate Bagby there is a profound sense of endurance and perseverance that is nothing short of inspirational. Its difficult not to laugh, cry, and get angry right along with the Bagbys throughout this film and by the end you almost feel as if you know the people involved. This is a heart-wrenching and emotional film that is definitely not for the lighthearted.

I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say that reading the reviews before the movie will not allow for the full effect that the film is capable of generating. 

I began watching the movie thinking that I would be sincerely sad about the whole situation. However, when the credits started rolling, I was incensed about the whole situation. I could not comprehend how there were people in this world that could do such terrible things...and ultimately get away with it. I'm a pretty understanding person, so not understanding the rationalization behind Shirley's thought process left me completely flabbergasted! 

The way Kurt puts together the film really allows the viewer to become emotionally involved with all the people and the situation. Especially at the end, when the viewer's emotions become synchronized with the rhythm of the film. 

I finished watching the movie with tears streaming down my face in both anger and sadness. The movie impacted me so much that I then wanted to know even more, so I did some online research for the rest of the day. 

Dear Zachary is such a powerful film that everyone should watch and prepare to be enraged!
