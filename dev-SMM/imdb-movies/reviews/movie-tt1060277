### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.

Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.

What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!

It was nice to finally watch movie that didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen before. This, much like Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" and "Children of Men", completely immerses you in this incredible situation with absolutely no knowledge to comfort you. It's very disorienting, which adds to the experience; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you're so into survival that you put it past you. You're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats.

The effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand-held camera, which isn't too bad-looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen. The filmmakers came up with some really great creature designs that were menacing yet very much original. If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music, then stay for the credits, during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled "Roar! (Cloverfield Theme)" plays.

All in all, a fantastic time at the movies. A little more background on the monster would be nice, though the absence of this information is intentional. Everyone in the theater was rooting for a sequel; maybe a second set of footage is found elsewhere? Or perhaps there is more the the viral marketing -- what exactly were Slusho and Tagruato? Also be prepared to suspend some disbelief, but considering the movie is about a monster destroying New York City, that shouldn't be too difficult.

I will admit, the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean, I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However, it's hard to have this curiosity, no matter how intriguing the monster is, when the script is so tired its in a coma.

Yes, the monster is cool. No, the stupid hand-held camera gimmick didn't bother me. Yes, the special effects are great and at times I did find myself in awe of the spectacle on the screen as it does seem real, but the movie itself is so, so, so dumb. At any moment I felt comfortable to leave to use the restroom as I knew exactly what I was going to miss. The plot was a paint by numbers and I would have loved even a touch of Bob Ross to fill the blanks, but no originality whatsoever.

First they steal the overdone Hollywood bit about love. "Dude, if you love her, tell her." Response: "I can't tell her, unless a mutant alien/ocean creature tries to expunge the city, only then will I try and make my move." Why have this? Why not make the story the monster? Really, who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found, which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.

Second, they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. "Let's try night vision on the camera." And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons, ones we can't see coming (which is why I think those monsters were blind). Cloverfield does none of this. It's a, where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. 

Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie, he's not funny, just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV, but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was "That's terrible" when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by, "That's terrible too" when we see when of its young-lings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie, words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter, "That's terrible cubed" before he was engorged upon. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Fourth, we have the killer/villain/monster has one last leap. Yes, we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. "We killed him" Hud proclaims, just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary, why? Oh, it's not scary, and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. 

Fifth, they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever, because King should always have chapters taken out, and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise, they may actually need to give the characters some arc, have some purposeful shots of the monster, maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and, uh-oh, give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did, I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it, as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing, but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good, but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful, but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T-2, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant film-making. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there, I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over, I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny, which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook, trite, clichéd, not smart, overdone, not scary, bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2, but pretty darn close.

I attended an early screening 1/10/08 at Michigan State University. I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film, but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.

Simply put, the film is an amazingly visceral experience. It's studio logo, production logo, film. No credits whatsoever, which just adds to the overall immediacy of it. If you've been following it to any degree whatsoever, you know that it's shot entirely with hand-held cameras. The characters also run. A lot. So immediately, I think this will be a love hate experience. My own reaction to it was that it again, added to the immersion, and I didn't find it to be really distracting at all. Many people I saw it with said they couldn't even watch the screen at times, so buyer beware. It also will anger those who need all the details, and need to have every loose end tied up (or even a majority of them). The entire film is the tape found after the events of the film are over. That's it. There is no set up, and no hold-your-hand-for-you resolution (or really, much of one at all). It's unconventional, and I enjoyed the ending TREMENDOUSLY. I definitely have to applaud the decision to not simply make a cookie cutter action film that is easy to watch. I think it will be interesting to watch how it does at the box office though.

After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting, and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters, who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time, as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous, and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed (although the screams were definitely there).

Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're already excited about it, I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience, and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner.

Definitely recommended: 8/10

... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.

So, let's count off:

Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.

Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.

Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: "Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all."

Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.

Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.

Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed "I feel a little dizzy" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.

Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.

Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.

Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.

Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.

Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.

Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch "I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!" dialog? Check.

Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.

... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.

If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.

I have to say that I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater in such a long time. Cloverfield brought back a sense of excitement and delight for me.

The movie draws you in, makes you a part of the experience. It succeeds primarily because of two things; what you see and what you hear.

The movie does not have a major actor stealing the screen. Everyone is treaded just about equal. As the viewer you feel you are with the group as you are seeing the movie from the first person view. You feel connected to the characters as you understand that because of their loss, they have to set something right and not escape from the city. The movie draws you in and you feel like you are a part of the action.

There is no music. Ambient sounds such as creeks and thumps don't distract you from looking at all the finer details. You stay focused on what's important and constantly entertained.

One thing you must remember going into this movie. Remember the first 10 seconds of the movie (the stuff that comes right after the Star Trek teaser). If you keep that in mind everything will make sense and make the movie more pleasurable.

If you haven't heard by now Cloverfield is a film about a giant monster attacking Manhattan all seen through the perspective of a 20-something's hand-held camera. The film has been hyped for months via viral marketing, JJ Abrams fan boys, and media coverage/ monster speculation. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is OH GOD YES Cloverfield is by far the most intense monster film I have ever seen in my lifetime, after the initial 15 minutes of character introduction and whatnot the film does not go 5 minutes without a HOLY CRAP moment. Constantly driving you to the edge of your seat at every turn and it really pulls no punches, I was surprised to learn it was rated PG13. Now the film is entirely filmed in shaky cam since you cant really survive a monster attack pushing a trolley around and it just works, you may get motion sickness though so be warned. The camera itself becomes a character of the film as it IS the viewer making everything happening on-screen more and more realistic. Now the acting is amateur but thats for the best considering that the film would have made no sense if they had used big name actors/actresses, the characters are not that deep either and mostly serve as fodder, comic relief, moral guidance, panic, commentary, puzzlement, a little bit of annoyance, in other words they're people surviving a monster attack. The presentation is brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending credits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff you'll ever see in a film. The monster itself is actually not seen in its entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience to piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much know as much as they do about everything going on making you actually feel like you're there. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch meets Godzilla but it is so much more than that, Cloverfield is the definitive American Monster Film, best if seen on the opening weekend just to hear the audience's reactions not to mention the presentation is far greater on the big screen, watch it again to see the things you missed or just to enjoy the ride again, admittedly the shock value will wane with multiple viewings but for what it's worth Cloverfield is an excellent piece of film and special effect engineering and is the first great monster film of the millennium. Its also downright scary at parts. 8/10

There was so much hype for this movie that you didn't need to know what it was about to see it. I'm sure many viewers this weekend are going to not know anything about the movie, just know that it's called Cloverfield and it was produced by JJ Abrams. I would think the movie wouldn't be as enthralling for someone who doesn't know much about it compared to someone who has been following message board posts for months, but I don't think it should matter.

So, let's begin. Cloverfield. The general plot of the movie is a home-made movie about a mans going away party that turns into a first person action thriller about a "monster" terrorizing the city. Well, I'm intrigued. I have been waiting for this movie for awhile since nothing exciting has come out recently. Everyone talking about the movie only made it more anticipated, so going into it I had high expectations. To be completely honest, I am satisfied. Shocked? Cloverfield is a movie like nothing I've seen before. I am sure this movie is based upon a few other films, but I haven't seen them. First of all, no it is not Godzilla. Second, I didn't get a chance to see Blair Witch Project so the first person thing was new to me. I know, I know. This however is what Made this movie what it is. It made you feel like you were in the action, on the streets running in fear alongside the citizens. It was freakin' sweet.

The action was intense, I expected nothing less from JJ. Once the movie got into motion with the city "earthquake" everything from then on was thrilling. I sat in the seat shaking in anticipation like I was sitting outside in the 20 degree weather; butterflies in my stomach for more than half the film. Awesome. The other part that was great was the sound and sights. It really felt like you were standing next to the soldiers shooting at the monster. And last but not least, the comedy... no seriously. There were many funny parts thanks to the cameraman. "Oh My God, you know Superman too? Geez I'm feeling a connection... have you heard of Garfield?". Classic.

Overall a solid, solid 9. Maybe a little high, but I thought the movie was amazing whether or not the ending was satisfying. No, I'm not telling you how it ends! To me, it was good though because it ended the film on a good note... yet kept the suspense and questions flowing. Also, no monster tips from me... I want you to be awaiting "its" face. Very good work, except on the title... what does Cloverfield have to do with it?

90 minute flick, so why not. Action/Thriller fans will love it; so go see it!

Hey, have ten bucks and two hours of your life to blow? Why not try Cloverfield! If you like motion-sickness inducing, hand-held, close-up, can't-focus-on-anything movies (a.k.a., anything by Michael Bay) then this is a movie for you and your six second attention span! Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there. In the meantime all of the monster crap interrupts a very special episode of Dawson's Creek, you know, the one where Dawson's going to leave for Japan and he finds out at the party that Joey's been sleeping around on him? Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.

But hey, on the bright side, everyone died and that made me smile.

It's a big-budget C-movie, and while that may sound like something entertaining to fans of shlock films, trust me when I tell you that it's not. Give me Godzilla vs. Mothra any day over this steaming pile. At least those movies have heart.

So, I went to a 5PM showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I found the characters to be very human and developed quite nicely over the course of the story. The special effects were excellent, with quite a few "oh $#!@" moments.

Be warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don't recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the "handy-cam" style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.

Very intense film.

What on earth is this movie doing with a 8.1/10 rating?

I think I'm being kind with a 3/10. It is just as a big a disaster for me as its trying to portray(but fails completely)

Now what puzzles me is why on earth would you go completely calm and focused towards an alien monster trashing the city with bombs being dropped on it? O please..to save a women who should have been dead but miraculously survives. She has a metal rod through her chest (or i think it was, with all that nauseating camera work) and should have died of loose of blood.... Now another thing i don't quite get is the camera...hmmm 10 hours of battery..yea, Captures all the good bits of an exiting adventure,HD quality and doesn't run out of battery or stop working from all the times its dropped and thrown in the movie! God i have to find a place where they sell these!

And now onto the acting...acting? Its not hard to scream and look really scared which is all they do..they don't even need to look convincing because half the time the camera is trying to look really really realistic and is filming the ground. Now this guys best friend that is filming...i don't think i have come across a narrator that annoying. What does he do in the movie apart from saying..omg what just happened dude?..what was that?Dude this is scary. I mean what the ****?When he finally dies after miraculously surviving a helicopter crash with his friends i rejoiced! Sorry for not knowing his name but even now i don't even know who's who?

Just don't bother with this movie, please I'm glad i only downloaded it first before going out to watch in the cinemas. You'll be wishing the movie to end so you can get on with your life.

Well, I clicked spoiler, but the spoiler is that there are no spoilers. Nothing to the movie.

About 75% of the audience hung around through the end credits, and let me tell you, that was universally the most negative reaction I have ever seen to any movie in a theater.

Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe how these people felt (at least according to how they expressed themselves).

The movie is, fortunately, short; only 90 mins or so long. 20 mins of that is spent at a party you would leave after 10 minutes if you hadn't paid to get in--a going away party for some loser that looks like a guy from your company's mail room. Apparently this loser has been promoted (improbably) to be a VP for his company in Japan.

The party apparently is intended to set up whatever is supposed to pass for the movie's paper thin plot line. All it did for me was condition me to the intentionally awful camera-work. Yeah, I realize it is stylistic and all---but bad camera-work doesn't pass for action. No, running through a crowd jostling a camera around does not translate to movie magic on screen.

There will be internet fan boys that will tell you the movie is great, a must see, very intense. Whatever. They are deluding themselves. These people will have spent the last year or more pumping this movie for JJ Abrams and will be unable to admit to themselves or you that it is simply not good.

i went in expecting a scary monster movie.

what i got was 15 minutes of bad TV dialog, and 45 minutes of shaky-cam running through the streets. the acting was OK but the characters were really unpleasant. not only did i not care if they died, by the end of the movie i was rooting for the monster.

there were a lot of plot holes and the decisions everyone made were totally unrealistic. it was hard to stay in the movie because of the constant lapses of common sense and logical flaws. those kinds of things really annoy me when they could have been fixed with a line or two of dialog.

finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time.

This has got to be the worst monster movie I have ever seen! Wait, not worst monster movie, worst MOVIE PERIOD! The whole movie is laughable. I sat there in the theater and wanted to know if and when anything was going to start. First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even starts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party guests and drunken camera wedding style say "hi" to Rob before he goes to Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you that they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip about 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of initial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens that keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses of it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big disappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even remotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body parts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three spots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They are used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting, and it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit longer. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship Troopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they just don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from Japan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the Japanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no Cloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the Godzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez called! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair Witch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home.

I am more of a "vote and not post" person but I have to at least get the word out that this movie is terrible!! People just need to AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS . . . . not your wallet costs!! 20 minutes of Blair Witch type camera-work for a going-away-party. The rest with unsteady camera shots that totally gave me a migraine headache. Horrible!! Storyline was poor and VERY slow. I kept finding moments to just close my eyes and try to make the agony stop. The ending was one of those where you look at your movie companion(s) and say, "ummm, is that it??? oh wait, there has to be more" and you sit and sit and realize that it's over. My friend and I agree that it is a mix of Blair Witch meets Starship Troopers meets Aliens.

What a waste of time and money. This movie would have been good if the camera was put down and a film was made. When the attack began the director should have the camera dropped then pan out and the movie start. Film the characters running and trying to rescue their friend. But, the way the movie was videotaped made the footage jerky and nauseating to watch. The fighting between the army and the "monster" was good, but again left you with too many unanswered questions. Besides, when a rescue helicopter takes off they do not fly parallel to the danger, they would fly away from danger. The ending was empty and left the viewers full of questions. Nothing was ever explained. Just stay at home and watch some home movies taped by your three year old. Might make more sense.

I have to hand it to JJ Abrams....we fell for this flick hook line and sinker.

The only downside is it COMPLETELY lacked substance. There was NO story. We went to see a monster movie only to find out NOTHING...I mean NOTHING about it. It was about stupid people who were unwilling to leave the city...and then were killed. Big deal.

In the end you didn't know how the monster got there, if they actually killed it, what it's powers were, what the little monsters were, where it came from, what it wanted....you never even got to see the entire shape of it or the use of all it's body parts.

It is the only movie I have ever wanted to walk out of. I just kept waiting for it to get better.

If Abrams ends Lost this way the world is going to come unglued!!!!!

Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.

Once again, with NYC as the target, aliens invade. Not right away, first you have to bear the brunt of mindless early 20's drunken banter and the scandal that one of them slept with another. You also have to believe one of these guys is wise enough to actually be promoted to an international vice-president's position, but to the film's credit, it never did say that daddy didn't own the company.

Cue to the attack and as everyone is sanely leaving the city, the golden boy jeopardizes his group of friends, who stalwartly refuse to leave him, in order to rescue his scorned princess. Along their way they get plenty of reminders that they should turn around and run, but press on. Including a wildly unrealistic encounter with the military in which golden boy argues that despite countless thousands already dead, they should help him go get his girlfriend, but if they won't help him, then he must save his girlfriend and they can shoot him if they want to but he's going. Personally I wanted the military to knock him out, with drugs or by force, just so I didn't have to watch the movie any more, and perhaps the focus would change to something more interesting. The military, being the sweet, understanding people that they are known to be when under hostile fire from aliens, point him in the right direction and wish him much success.

The only thing amazing about the film is the battery life on the video camera. And if the battery power had to continue, I was cheering the invaders on, to find this group and devour them just so I didn't have to listen to them anymore.

I was very excited to see this movie when I entered the theater on Wednesday afternoon.I was very impressed with the trailers that were on the screen before the main show;"CLOVERFIELD". But as the movie started I felt I had entered a bad dream, one that I could not wake up from! As I sat there, in the first 10 Mins., my brother-in-law got so sick with all the "camera shake" that he had to leave the theater.The first 20mins. was so boring I almost got up to join him. The plot was so vague that I felt I had walked in in the middle of the movie. Now some people would say; Why did you stay and watch such a bad movie? Well, let me tell you , I am a great lover of movies and consider myself a movie expert,"self proclaimed Of course"and I will almost never walk out,but this movie came very close.The monster had no personality and was boring!And at the end it just stops.YES STOPS! with no explanation of anything...the people...the monster....the city....nothing! You might think,"Great there's going to be a Sequel" I say no way,I hope they make a bundle on this one cause- Fool me once shame on you but fool me twice shame on me and then shoot me in the head to put me out of my misery!Bottom line THIS MOVIE SUCKED! Thank you for reading this hopes this helps.

First, as many have said before, don't go to this movie if you are prone to motion sickness. Or, unless you take Dramamine. I appreciate the attempt at a first-person POV film, but more than a few people in the theater were looking away from the screen as characters ran recklessly through the streets of Manhattan.

Second, if you choose to go to this film, check reality at the door. I know it's a monster movie, so reality isn't necessarily the point. However, some of the things the characters are able to do go far beyond their, or their technology's capabilities.

Third, it is short and ends abruptly. Thankfully, I went for free, but $9.00 or more for what amounts to a super-sized episode of Lost seems pricey. I enjoy going to movies for closure. I left feeling like I didn't know what happened to Manhattan. I would also like to know, if Manhattan was supposedly completely destroyed by the monster and military, how was the video recovered from Central Park. Some closure on that would have made the film much more enjoyable.

Don't waste your time or money. Innovative, but predictable, nauseating, and unbelievable.

I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film, I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.

I didn't like this clichéd film. I believe it is a flawed exercise about character perspective and documented realism. However, the special effects were poor but some of them passable; the editing kept an appropriate rhythm; the performances were regular, with the clear exception of T.J. Miller who played the obnoxious camera man, Hud. He did an awful job.

My main dislikes with this film were the camera movement and the argument overall.

First, the camera moves excessively all time. Even during the party sequence, all the scenes are horribly captured. Hud wasn't running from a monster then, was he? I get the filmmaker's intention, but I felt more nauseated than afraid because they went too far with their movement. The moment I dissociated myself from the movie and started feeling trapped inside a really expensive handy-cam, I knew the original intention had gotten lost. In that respect, the Blair Witch Project (which I also didn't like, but for other reasons) is superior by far. Its technical proposal does help convey a profound emotional impact; whereas Cloverfield's camera trembling doesn't. Consequently, the characters on Cloverfield remain mostly aloof, which really makes some silly elements in the plot to stand out.

SPOILERS START NOW: That brings me to my second main dislike: the argument. Were they joking? I don't even mean the monster. It's a monster movie, so I won't even go there. Everyone goes to save Beth, the romantic interest of Rob, who is beyond logical salvation. Sure, Rob's friends try to stop him from going to his certain death, but they all end up joining him anyway (!) Consequently, "Beth" becomes more of a cheap plot device than a character.

But I mean Marlena joined them? From what we know of her, she wouldn't. That's character inconsistency right there. So, let's assume she had her psychological reasons to do it. She's after all supposedly human and complex. But throughout her time on the screen nothing happens to shed any light as to why she is with them. So, there's no depth to her. No need for her, expect to save Hud's life once.

Also, the love story between Rob and Beth rests so much in what some people say of them and a few lines between the wretched lovers, that it becomes shallow and boring. Sure, some say he's been in love with her forever and they do share a wonderful day at Columbus Circle and Coney Island. Of course, she has got to be the love of his life. I'm not cynical, and I actually enjoy romantic themes, but this was an insult. I mean, the whole story rests so much on this supposed doomed love that it ought to have been better explored. The performances were so flat in this category, that they didn't help either. Again, the love story turned into yet another sort of plot device.

When the friends "rescue" Beth from her building, she is severely injured, and yet she can walk and even run. At the end, when they arrive to the evacuation area, despite her bleeding injury, Beth is not the first one to climb into the helicopter. In fact, she has to wait for another helicopter to take her out because the soldiers offer the only seat to Lily, who is physically well. It is ridiculous. Obviously, the real reason the filmmakers did that is so that the lovers, Rob and Beth, could remain together until the end. Have I said plot device before? Cheap and trashy plot device? And there's more, much more rubbish like that throughout the film. 

SPOILERS HAVE ENDED. 

Also, the fact that Hud was filming everything -even in the party- almost every private moment, is ludicrous. The filmmaker's choice of the handy-cam as the true narrator is too limited, so he naturally had to use it to an unbelievable degree. The consequence is that the purpose of capturing a sense of realism is defeated, and Cloverfield ends up being an absurdly unrealistic movie in its own monster-destroying-New-York-movie context-.

In Cloverfield, the filmmakers ask you to accept too many things just as they tell you they are. However, the movie consistently fails to provide you with valid reasons for doing so. They keep forcing on you a story of the poorest quality. It's almost offensive.

Weak screenplays do that. And when they do, one at least expects something in return, whether a feeling or a memorable moment. Something that would justify the torture. Unfortunately, with Cloverfield one ends up empty-handed, jerky camera movements aside.

I don't recommend this film at all, especially if you value the use of a tripod or the meaning of storytelling. In any case, if you're going to see it, please don't expect anything great and try not to eat or drink liquids for a couple of hours before and while watching it. In all honesty, it can make you feel physically (as well as mentally) nauseated.

Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs.

This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only was it hard to watch because of the home video concept of filming, but it was horrible.

The Alien monster was like a giant praying mantis with babies that fell off itself and attacked people. I can deal with that, but the fact that bombs and tanks had no effect against it is ridiculous.

The only highlight in the entire movie was the guy behind the camera and his funny one liners. The movie was a hour and twenty-five minutes long, and ended with no questions being answered. You could not enjoy the action or suspense, because the camera was never still or clear. I have loved J.J Abrams' work in the past, but this is something he should not have put his name on.

Luckily I used free passes for entry and I did not have to pay for tickets, otherwise I would have demanded my money back. Don't believe any other comments that this was an intense thrilling movie, because it was not. The monster was ridiculous and laughable.

The love stories between 3 different couple was dull and more high schoolish. Not what one would think a Vice Pres. of a company would have, and when one of the love interests died (the main character's brother) it was like "Oh Well". The injury suffered by Beth (a rebar through the chest) is not something that one would get up from and then run around. And apparently if you get bit by the small ones, you spontaneously combust.

All I can say is just plain bad, don't waste your money. Burning your ten dollars would be just as painful, but the bright thing about that would be that it would only last about a minute.

There were two interesting things about seeing this movie, unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie, that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be, raw footage. The acting was lacking at best, the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot, which it *might* have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.

But even the worst visual movies can have a deeper meaning, right? So what about this one? 

There are obvious 9/11 references/similarities, for instance, it was an attack on NYC. The imagery of terrified people running through the streets from the dust clouds of a collapsed building would conjure thoughts of 9/11 in even the most dim witted person. But as much as you pick this one apart there wasn't any purpose beyond using it as an implement to regurgitate fear. No, this movie isn't some sort of pompous social commentary on the American dream/lifestyle/people/whatever. It's actually quite empty as far as metaphor/meaning goes. But honestly, it's not like people would expect that from a monster movie anyway, right? 

Although it was the connection this movie shared with 9/11 that brings me to my first interesting point. Almost every time a tragedy of this proportion occurs there are countless stories (books, movies or any other medium) that reference it (however vaguely) for decades to come. For example, look at post-Nagasaki/Hiroshima Japan. I'd be curious to see the list of movies that depict the mass destruction of Tokyo via atomic or nuclear bomb. Not to mention the other Japanese movies that center around the general ruining of cities... mostly by a few specific gigantic monsters... which will remain unnamed. 

The second interesting thing happened to be something which I've never witnessed in a movie theater before. It made it worth paying the ten dollars for a ticket, wasting an hour and half of my life and enduring a headache the camera work gave me. As the ending credits started and the lights slowly came back on the audience unanimously started trash-talking the movie. There was booing from all corners of the theater, someone seated behind me said harshly "this movie sucked!", and the girl who was with him asked him, "what did you drag me to??" Their reactions were fairly amusing, and undoubtedly the best part of the whole movie experience. 

All in all there were a couple of really cool visuals in the movie... Unfortunately this alone isn't worth the price of the movie, not even the price of the DVD, not even the price of the DVD once it goes into the "shitty $3.99 movie bin" at best buy. Either stay clear of this one or if your curiosity gets the best of you find a pirated version for free.

::SPOILER:: Oh, and before I forget. For all the reported "realism" in this movie I'd like someone to explain to me exactly how a plastic video tape survives the tens of millions of degrees caused by the blast of a nuclear bomb......

But now I'm just being nit picky.

Right, Let it be known, this film is f****n quality! Genuinely, i watched it with no expectations- the cheeky marketing of it revealing very little worked perfectly in my instance. The opening 5/10mins meets characters, and almost tricks you into a false sense of calm and normality.

When 'events proceed', the camcorder style filming instills a genuine realism to events, and the films definitely feeds off the mass concern and shock at global events/terrorist attacks/disasters, and the disjointed way news feeds through.

I will say no more but this- watch this film. Don't go finding too much out, just watch, and get taken to a place most fiction movies aren't able to transport viewers to. Intense has been said a lot in other peeps reviews its exactly that. Proper Rocks.
