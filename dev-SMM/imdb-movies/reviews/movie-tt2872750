### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I am a grown male and got the timings wrong to see The Interview and could not be bothered to wait for the next screening so I selected the next film starting.

I have never seen the series, so cant judge if this is a good or bad adaptation all I can say this is a truly funny film though aimed at children is funny enough to keep me entertained.

The animation is uniformly excellent and honestly kept me guessing from the start to the end whether it was CGI or stop motion, I am still not sure even after reading all the credits. Maybe I didn't read them properly because the theme tune is very catchy and bounces round the head even now. 

The story is easy to follow, the characters are likable and there is no trite wince inducing dialogue, everything is mumbled by the humans and the sheep communicate in a variations of bahs. There are some cracking running gags and a smattering of fart jokes. The sheep in disguise have to be seen to believed and the viewer would be surprised what goes on with a horse.

The closing credits though long are a fun roll with a funny bit at the end.

Watch it. I bet The Interview wont be as much fun.

I never ever go to the cinema (I rather wait for the Blu-ray to be released and just paying once but yet I went to London from Spain just to see this movie. I didn't wanna wait for it to be released here. 

Shaun the Sheep is a brilliant TV show so when I found out a movie was being made I was totally thrilled. Even though going from the 7-minute episode to a full length movie was a big step, I was confident in Aardman to made the transition easily. They didn't disappoint. First, let me say that I love stop-motion; it's such an "intimate" technique due to the fact that you always have to literally be on top of the character to change it every time he makes the slightest movement. But not only is the technique beautiful, the story doesn't disappoint either. This doesn't feel like a dragged out episode of the show, it feels like a story that goes beyond the usual surroundings of the show while still maintaining how everything works. This movie made me laugh a lot. If there's something that Shaun the Sheep always achieved was the ability to create humor of the most simplest situations. But I also cried a lot. Tears of sadness and happiness. And truthfully, I never expected Shaun the Sheep to reach me so deeply. There's a scene where you can see so much pain in Shaun eyes. And that's just clay! My God, congratulations to whoever did that, it was so moving. And I also had a sweet spot about Slip, the dog that Shaun meets early in the movie and come along for the adventure. She was a new character but she felt like and old member of the gang. 

I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time. And I haven't felt so many thing with a movie in a long time either. So thank you, Aardman, for giving a fan such a great gift.

I considered Aardmans last stop motion effort 'Pirates - in an adventures with scientists' to be a bit of a let down when it was released three years ago and wondered if they had gone off the boil a little bit by trying to appeal to the mass market and thus diluting their witty humour as a result. However after 80 odd minutes of Shaun the Sheep I am happy to report that they are back on track.

Shaun is extremely well animated and manages to keep the story ticking along and funny enough to keep your interest without really feeling stretched. Considering as the film has no real dialogue to speak of that is no mean feat, and is reliant on top notch production design, expressive animation and a script that is entertaining and funny without being overly ridiculous. Whilst the Shaun the Sheep/Timmy Time TV shorts are aimed at young viewers, there is a decent amount of underlying humour here that adults will also engage with and thus it doesn't insult your intelligence the way some films do.

After Aardmans infamous falling out with DreamWorks (who wanted them to Americanize Wallace & Gromit) I did wonder if Aardman had sold out for the mass market after feeling the Sony Pictures distributed Pirates had a whiff of compromise to it, and that's partly why I felt Pirates fell a bit flat. However Aardman have teamed up with an independent European distributor for Shaun and as a result it seems they were allowed to make the film they wanted to make this time round. In effect I was not disappointed with Shaun, the simple but hilarious premise of the TV show is expanded successfully to the big screen with no noticeable compromises for the mass market. That the film is also dialogue free should make it an easy sell abroad too and I'm glad to see the film has been well received.

So well done to Aardman for making one of 2015's most enjoyable, entertaining and amusing films so far.

The very notion of Shaun The Sheep Movie sounds faintly ridiculous, as if the universe were playing a joke on movie-going audiences around the world. A hyper-intelligent sheep embarking on an epic adventure to save the farmer who shears off his wool every year? What utter claptrap. The film has next to no lines of intelligible dialogue and is based on a long-running TV show for kids? How ludicrous. Is anyone above the age of three actually expected to want to watch this film? And yet, there's plenty to recommend this charming, full-hearted gem from Aardman Animation - a studio so passionate and dedicated to its craft and characters that it literally animates entire worlds in exhaustingly tiny increments.

Everyone in Mossy Bottom Farm, including our titular hero (given 'voice' by Justin Fletcher), has settled into a dreary routine. One day, Shaun decides to shake things up a little. So he distracts sheepdog Bitzer and traps the Farmer (both voiced by John Sparkes) in a caravan, all in aid of allowing his entire flock to take a day off from their boring lives. But Shaun didn't account for a steep hill, a runaway caravan and a bout of amnesia. Soon, he and his buddies - with the help of Bitzer and stray pooch Slip (Tim Hands) - must hunt for the Farmer in the Big City, even as they try to keep out of the clutches of Trumper (Omid Djalili), a fearsome agent tasked with Animal Control.

It's easy to gripe about Shaun The Sheep's simple plot: this is hardly a complex film. Indeed, it lingers obstinately in the realm of entertainment for kids, even packing in the requisite learning points about friendship and not taking things for granted. The film can sometimes feel simplistic too, given its persistent lack of dialogue and its cheerfully frequent descent into slapstick comedy. There's very little of the cheeky satire here that makes Aardman's Wallace & Gromit franchise such a blast.

But Shaun The Sheep Movie is delightful in so many ways that it's just easier for everyone above a certain age to give in to their inner child. The characters may be fashioned out of clay and wood and painstakingly animated at an extremely slow speed, but the film itself positively crackles with energy. The narrative pokes fun at the concepts of fashion, incarceration and going viral, even as it bounces merrily through a host of hilarious gags. The soporific effect of sheep leaping over fences is mined for plenty of laughs, while the camera checks in with a particularly crazed inmate of Animal Control and an utterly charming Baa-bershop Quintet. 

Quite a bit of thought has evidently been devoted to the development of the film's main characters - certainly more than you'd get in some Hollywood blockbusters. Shaun is a sweetly determined hero, refusing to leave any sheep - or human, or dog - behind, even as he cleans up a mess that is (strictly speaking) of his own making. The Farmer, too, gets a storyline that spices the comedy up with a hint of drama, as he stumbles into a new career through his forgotten but deeply-ingrained skill with shearing sheep. The lack of dialogue in the film also proves to be, quite frequently, a plus. Not only does it push the story in inventive directions, it allows the incredibly expressive characters to take centre stage - their hopes, dreams and fears communicated with barely a word spoken.

This all makes for a thoroughly charming experience at the cinema - Shaun The Sheep Movie isn't likely to make you dig deep or ponder long and hard about life, but it will almost certainly entertain you in breathtaking (and breathless!) fashion. In almost every aspect - from the deft character design to its incredibly catchy soundtrack, the film radiates a sweet, optimistic charm that will win over just about everybody who gives it a chance.

This was, for me anyway, the usual Saturday afternoon flick with my partner and son to pass an hour or two. 

To be honest could have been any movie.

The movie started sedately enough but gathered pace and complexity with every minute ,throughout the audience was laughing out loud , adults and children alike (including me). 

It had everything for kids and adults, some rude jokes, great references to adult movies. A multi-layered villain, heroes and comedic characters.

The animation was stunning but i stopped looking at the animation and got hooked on the story and characters, maybe that's the way it should be.

Definitely worth a hour or so of anybody's time.

13 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Aftenoon - Shaun The Sheep. I would just like to point out that I was the only adult there without a child.....or maybe I was the only child without an adult!!!!!! Nick Park and his team have done it again. This was classic Aardman animation, with our old pal Shaun. Bored with his mundane life Shaun and his sheepy friends engineer a way to have a day off but all goes drastically wrong when the farmer ends up in the big city with memory loss. It's up to the animals to save him and what follows is a madcap series of events where nobody questions sheep dressed as humans or any of the antics that occur. Completely without dialogue the story is carried along by the excellent score and gesticulations and a gaggle of bleats, grunts and other indiscriminate noises. As we know animation these days caters for all ages and with various movie references included the adults were definitely laughing at different times to the children. Watching some good old stop motion animation is a very pleasant way to pass the time.

For a while, I've held a belief that Aardman can do no wrong, and thankfully this latest example has kept up that belief and then some. It's actually rather difficult to write a review of this movie, because there's not a whole lot one can actually comment on. For instance, I can't say anything about voice acting, or script, because there is literally no dialogue. I mean, there are voice actors (for example Omid Djalili as Tramper the villain) but all they do is mumble (and in the case of the sheep actors, bleat) and stuff. I suppose this, then, serves as a testament to the sheer quality of Aardman's animation. In addition to it being fantastic that claymation can still find its way onto the screen today, it's also brilliant that such a film has found such capable animators; the animation is beautiful, and though you may think they may not be able to convey so much emotion with just facial expressions and mumbles, lo and behold, they do; from glee, to terror, to sadness, to panic, and many more, the characters they've created are absolutely brimming with emotion, and immensely watchable at the same time, and that just makes this movie all the more effective. Lack of a proper script also doesn't seem to trouble Aardman either; this movie is really goddamn funny. The physical comedy sequences, the highlight of which has to be the gleefully chaotic scene in a restaurant, are done to a tee, quite possibly the best Aardman has done them since Flushed Away, while Aardman's trademark sight gags, though not quite as strong as they were in previous offering The Pirates! (the Brian Blessed gag comes to mind), are ever-present and really quite amusing, however obvious or subtle they may be (for instance, "The Big City - twinned with Le Grande Ville, La Ciudad Grande"). My main gripe was that towards the end, which I won't spoil, things do get a bit too cheesy for my tastes, but the rest of the movie, and indeed most of the climactic sequences, more than make up for that. Shaun The Sheep: The Movie only serves to reinforce why I am such a huge fan of the Bristol lads to begin with, and while it is nowhere near as good as their first two features, it is definitely a worthy addition to their fine repertoire of work. If you're looking for some great entertainment on an afternoon, you could do a lot worse than this.

For 'Shaun the Sheep' Aardman Animations gracefully goes back to its roots. If you are not familiar with the character of Shaun, then perhaps I should elaborate. He was first seen in the third Wallace & Gromit short 'A Close Shave'. The world he inhabits has no characters that speak an audible line of dialogue. It is all silent, save for the odd sound effect and the musical score. This is Aardman's sixth feature length film or third if you just count stop-motion.

The plot is of course very basic. But that suits the film just fine, it is not trying to be the next 'Inception' and it doesn't need to be. With silent films the simpler the better. Shaun decides that he wants some well deserved time off from his work on the farm. The group or flock want a day off, but they instead end up in rather a mess. Which eventually leads them to the Big City aka London. Meanwhile, through a misunderstanding their farmer is hospitalized with no recollection of whom he is and Shaun. It is up to Shaun and the gang to set the farmer free and return home, before further trouble is had.

Queue great scenes that are funny, referential and light hearted. The first factor being the most unexpected, considering that there is no dialogue at all. Meaning that Shaun relies heavily upon visual humour, which works a treat. It never forays into dark territory and thankfully keeps the tone consistently light hearted with good intentions. It would be impossible to list all the references one could find when viewing it, but let me bring up a few. They are, The Shawshank Redemption, The Silence of the Lambs and The Wolverine. So even the adults will get a chuckle out of it. This film really is for all ages.

The stop motion animation is fabulous and showcases how far Aardman have come along since 1989's A Grand Day Out. It is even well paced and runs little over seventy-five brief minutes. Meaning it never gets tiresome. But the length proves to still be part of the problem. The film is far too short and I wanted I needed so much more. I would not have minded watching this film even if its running time was in fact doubled. I know this is not a big issue, considering the film is silent and still has warmth, heart and a soul. But, some character development would not have gone amiss.

If you are curious as to where 'Shaun' places amongst the other feature length stop motion pictures, then it follows thus; it is greater than 'Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were- Rabbit', but lacks the shear enthusiasm of 'Chicken Run'. But, could the woolly fella ever compete with such grand competition? Probably not, but there is less than a feather between the overall quality of the two.

'Shaun the Sheep' to the cynical will no doubt appear to be a cash grab from Aardman. (As the gang already have a television show to its name). This could not be further from the truth. Shaun is warm, heartfelt, moving, exciting and soulful. No matter what age you are, you will be in for a delight provided by this excellent film from Aardman, further proving that they can do no wrong. I urge anyone to come forward and say they were bored; the mere thought of which is inconceivable!

Excuse the pun in the title, i had to do it because this latest Aardman outing isn't a baaad film at all (sorry :P).

I am a huge fan of stop-motion, the way these types of films are animated fascinate me. I grew up loving Wallace and Gromit and I always loved the character of Shaun The Sheep so I was looking forward to this in some ways, although I wasn't sure the character could carry a film by himself but not to worry because he really can!

This type of film has been seen a lot, a group of characters end up in a situation that isn't within their comfort zone, in this case from farm to city. It isn't an original plot sure but it is handled so well that i was entertained throughout. The start was beginning to be a little slow, but started off so well that by the time it started to drag and feel slow something else happened which made the film entertaining again. From the moment the farmer ends up in the big city the jokes fly at you and these are as much for adults than they are for kids. I found myself laughing waaay more than i expected. Very simple jokes and laughs, but in a way that worked almost flawlessly. And this was all handled with no dialogue whatsoever, only the occasional baa or mumble from the human characters.

I highly recommend this to anybody who is looking for a film that will entertain the whole family and if you are planning on seeing Fifty Shades of Grey over this then don't.. you will be wasting your time. At 85 minutes this is the perfect length to keep young ones entertained and also before any of the jokes got stale or before interest is lost. A very simple and very English feeling film that left me feeling great. I hope to see more stop-motion animated films because I am a huge fan of these and this one looks absolutely beautiful. I hope this gets a nomination for best animated picture just for the style because i would back it up all the way. You will not regret seeing this one i promise

In my opinion, Shaun the Sheep, the TV show, is the best thing Aardman have ever done. Fiendishly funny, inventive and almost surreal in its enjoyment levels, adults will be able to enjoy it too. Shaun isn't Gromit, but he's a good character and here he stars in his own movie. He, the flock and the sheepdog go into the city to rescue their Farmer. This is an old premise for a film of this type, although new things are done with it and the city rendered in glorious Claymation never stops being fun to look at. Visually it's a very clever film and as it's stop motion it never feels artificial. Shaun the Sheep Movie isn't a profound film and it's all about the humour, which it delivers on. With unpredictable and bitingly effective jokes, clever slapstick and an atmosphere of unrestrained glee, this offers charm in spades and the laughs don't really stop flowing. A scene which occurs in a restaurant is one of those moments where you wish they could pause the film for a moment so that you can stop laughing and regain your composure.

It's not flawless though. While this won't bother many, some poor continuity to the TV show, such as there being fewer sheep than normal and the Farmer being fond of the sheep in an overly sentimental manner can be irritating. The music is a bit jarring, and some of the jokes are a little broad and some of the set pieces are too threatening. The truth is, short TV shows being stretched to fit a feature length running time often stretches a simple premise beyond breaking point. This doesn't quite happen here, but the film runs out of gas before the end and it's not quite as inventive as say, The Wrong Trousers or A Close Shave. There are plenty of laughs, but they rarely reach the levels of hilarity the TV series would often produce. STSM is a good animated film and certainly worth seeing over many of the other films currently in cinemas and it's a good laugh for the whole family. However, it's not quite what it could have been, but it strikes an 8 on the laugh o meter.

The rule of giving a cartoon show its own feature-length movie is usually sacrificing most of what defines its own material to make way for larger ideas or templates to fit in the scale of cinema. We get that issue in many adaptations, which often become a disaster or just loses the essence of what makes it great. Shaun the Sheep is quite a little show for a movie, thus this feature film takes these characters to more places, face an actual villain and develop a character arc to make up for the antics. But thankfully, those didn't hurt what makes this show charming, because apparently, it stays pretty loyal to its roots and yet feels sincere about the demanded elements that a feature film should have. And the easiest way to describe it, it looks like an extended episode of the show, but with more heart and sights that are appropriate enough in a theatrical form.

The film already seems fine at heightening the adventure, but anything else remains faithful to the show's personality. There's no exact dialogue added to appeal wider audiences, it's all physical comedy, but done in its classic way. Though, there's a plot meant to be followed through these playfulness and what often troubles in these cases is it might lead the narrative into contrivances, but in this movie, it doesn't. The story just knows what it's doing and where it's going, even in scenes that seem to be designed for laughs turn out to be essential to the story. And after going through a lot of variety of silliness, the story eventually reveals its big picture. This is a movie that doesn't have any actual talking, but the characters are so full of life that their actions and expressions easily speaks out the heart of the story. That's one of the things to admire in this film.

And there's really nothing goes wrong with the animation. It's Aardman! They're the expert of stop-motion, and as said, the animation brims so much life and delight. And it doesn't stop there, the Big City where the story is mostly settled into is filled with details that depicts the environment of modern city. It also explores pop culture, mostly satirizing it, which adds to its set of creative laughs and a sudden conflict for the plot. But the stop-motion is already enough to enjoy the good old claymation.

Another cynical theory that Shaun the Sheep Movie might have fell into is being a trifle, possessing only one aim by just bringing these characters to the big screen and nothing else. The trailers (sort of) make it seem like that, but it's best if the film surprises us with its center and funnier adventures. It's no groundbreaker to the genre or anything, but if you could imagine Shaun the Sheep getting his own movie, this film just perfectly pictures anyone's expectations, except it's sort of better for the heart alone. But then, the stop-motion is always magnificent, and even if the plot wasn't this inspired, it's always cool to see these plasticine come to life, but Aardman have more ambition than that.

When Shaun decides to take the day off and have some fun, he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home.

I just got back from the theater. Before I begin, I will say that I have been a fan of the output of Aardman Animations, I have seen all of the Wallace & Gromit shorts, as well as the movie, I have also seen Chicken Run, and I have seen this movie. Who would thought that a movie about a bunch of cute looking sheep could be such a touching and heartwarming experience? Well that's what this movie is. The Shaun The Sheep Movie is one of the best piece of output from Aardman yet, it's funny, it's exciting, it's touching, and it's even downright tear-jerking in some instances. I didn't know what to expect when I sat down in my theater seat, but I can say that this is one of the most enjoyable experiences that I have had at the movies in quite some time. This film proves that the people at Aardman have not lost any of their touch even after all of these years, they have shown that they are still capable of producing animated marvels, which are great for just about everyone of all ages.

Is the movie funny? Sure it is, there are plenty of scenes that will have you laughing, some of the antics that Shaun and company go through produce quite a few laughs. However, there are a few dark elements to the movie. The villain of the movie is an over-zealous animal control worker named Trumper. As far as Aardman villains go, Trumper is on the same scale as Victor Quartermaine from the Wallace & Gromit movie as far as sheer villainy goes. And like Victor Quartermaine, Trumper is definitely a character that will leave you saying: "I hope he gets what's coming to him." 

Like I said, although the movie has some laughs, there are also some very sad parts to the movie. There are several scenes involving Shaun being gloomy that really manage to get through to the audience. There are a few closes ups in the film featuring Shaun with tears in his eyes, when I saw that, I could feel my own eyes beginning to get a hurting feeling to them. The pain in his eyes...the audience can feel it. On top of all that, Shaun is such a cute little sheep, and seeing such a cute sheep like Shaun crying or getting tears in his eyes makes me wish that I could warp myself inside the movie and give him a great big hug. What really sends it home is the music that plays during these scenes, try not to tear up while watching those bits. The crew at Aardman deserve major kudos for being able to get something so moving through to the audience. So don't feel bad if you let a few tears loose while watching this film, as its perfectly okay to do so.

All in all, The Shaun The Sheep Movie is an excellent delight, and it would not be overdoing it if you were to say that this is the best animated movie of the year. The movie is a funny, exciting, touching, and even emotional film that contains a message for us all. The film teaches us: "Even if a situation seems hopeless, true friends will always be beside you." Basically, this is a film that runs on the rule of the power of friendship. In short, if you are looking for an animated film that is a combination of funny, exciting, emotional, and heartwarming, then this film should be the one. The Shaun The Sheep Movie is more proof of the genius behind the people at Aardman, and it is their best work since The Wallace & Gromit movie.

I grew up having a few of the Wallace and Gromit films on VHS and so I was excited to see what Aardman Animations next had in store. Shaun the Sheep comes from the same company and producers and is one of the most innocently fun rides you'll have watching a film in 2015. The animation is spectacular and it's humor for kids and adults is hilariously impressive.

There's no dialogue besides giggles and some mumbled yelling between characters, but you never need it. You know exactly what the characters are feeling purely based on the music and facial expressions. Coming from British writers and producers, the humor is definitely a little bit different than something we would see in an American kids movie, but it works nonetheless. The good thing about this movie over something like Minions, also a summer release, is that there's tons of silly humor but there's also some heart within this story as well. You're always rooting for Shaun and his crew of sheep to find their owner and get back to the farm. The burp/fart jokes are there, but not has overbearing as some other kids films.

Knowing that this comes from a stop motion animation company, makes the physical humor all the more impressive. All of the action is seamless. The movie made me laugh more out loud by myself than Minions did watching it with an entire audience. Shaun the Sheep is a film all audiences will enjoy from kids to adults alike. I sure hope they make more of these.

+Brilliant humor

+Beautiful animation

+Funny story with heart

Remember Wall-E? Remember how all those robots became endearing to audiences throughout that whole film without the ability to string together so much as a sentence of dialog? That's how I feel about Shaun the Sheep Movie.

Aardman animation found something special with their original Shaun the Sheep series, but many would have assumed it to be a fun distraction for the time, never to be revisited. With Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, and even their most recent Pirates; the studio seems to be aiming for bigger, more robust films featuring witty dialog. To go back to this franchise for a new feature film seems almost like a step backwards. Shaun the Sheep Movie is anything but that.

The film starts in the setting of the original series, showcasing day to day life and routine on the farm. Shaun decides they all deserve a day off and comes up with an elaborate plan for doing so. They follow through with it and cause the farmer to get lost in the big city and lose his memory. The dog leaves into the city to go find his master followed by Shaun and the rest of the sheep. The plot is simple and for the most part predictable, but that's perfectly fine. Shaun the Sheep Movie entertains it's audiences through its fun, cartoon, slapstick humor. With gags that are sure to make adults and children laugh, this is the best kind of family comedy. Jokes make references to other films as well as popular trends. In between laughs, the film had me feeling for the farmer who has lost his identity and rooting for the animals trying to reunite their family. 

As an adaptation, the film takes some liberties with the changes so as to give characters meant for short television episodes the depth they need for a feature film. Unless you are a purist fan of the original series, these changes(like a more sentimental farmer) are more than welcome to make the movie work. The changes don't stray too far from the heart of why audiences loved these characters in the first place. The major drawback here is that stretching these characters into 85 minutes starts to get a little dull around the middle, before the third act picks up the action again. 

I've always loved stop motion animation as an art. With all the advances we make in CGI, there will always be one way to make this kind of movie. There's a certain childlike wonder from seeing colorful miniature figures come to life in a film. These qualities are what embody Aardman's films and Shaun the Sheep movie is no exception.

If you love Claymation and the work of Wallace and Gromit, you won't need my confirmation to watch this. But for those uninitiated, let me tell you that this movie while aimed at kids, will bring the inner child out of every adult who goes and enjoys that ride too. And all that virtual without dialog.

It is cute when animals talk, but for that there are other movies to watch. It's not that this is realistic or anything (there are some really crazy action set pieces, especially towards the end), but the power of mimic/facial expressions is back again. And words are not always needed, in this case none at all. There's a lot of ways to have fun then, and this can be one of them

I don't usually write reviews. I'm not that type...definitely not but when I saw this movie, something sparkled within me. I felt something...something which I haven't felt for a long time since I last saw the LOTR trilogy, something which made me wanna write this review.

Shaun is an excellent character!! Even in simple scenes, that sheep will literally, make you laugh & at the same time, make you cry & not only him. Even his compatriots' actions prove that,"True friends will always stick with you, even in tricky situations" What made me super-excited was the Music! It's been so long since I heard good music being played in an animated film (For me & last time it was the Spongebob film - TERRIBLE!) When you got comedy & large amounts of it combined with a little dose of tragedy plus the right music playing in all these scenes, then I really don't see why this movie doesn't deserve less than 10 stars. Matter of fact that's the secret combination behind a successful animated film. This movie left me satisfied...thoroughly satisfied!

I was both anxious and excited to see this movie, because I loved every other work by Aardman Animations and I didn't want to be disappointed.

Well, I wasn't. The characters are endearing in their way, the plot is pretty good, the jokes are mostly funny, but what really impressed me was the work put behind the animation. You can feel how much effort was put in this movie. 

It was a long time since I saw a cartoon in a theater, but I don't regret it. I had a really great time. It made me want to watch again Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit. In Shaun the Sheep, you can feel (and see) how much they improved their animation technique. I will recommend it to any person who want to have a nice time relaxing and laughing.

I know the title of this review sounds cliché and somewhat pandering, but this film truly is a delight for all well mannered (perhaps even ill tempered) audiences of all ages.

As other reviews have stated, the main character, Shaun the Sheep, is from the Wallace and Gromit short "A Close Shave", where in Shaun helps the duo overcome a mechanical threat of canine sorts. 

This film propels Shaun (a star in his own series) into the biggest adventure he's ever had since "A Close Shave" way back in the mid 90s. Shaun leads his flock through a series of very funny misadventures to rescue a member of their farm-family, so to speak.

Everything here is pantomime, and hearkens back to the days of old before sound was added to film. This is, in spirit, a silent film in the sense that there's no dialogue, and all the communication is primarily done with showing the audience the story as opposed to telling it to us through dialogue. The gags are the usual clever Aardman offerings, but there's also some very witty use of classic silent era gags, yet with a very British flavor of understatement, which makes the comedy in this film all that much funnier.

Truly I hadn't laughed out loud at a comedy film in who knows how long, and it was something that was much welcome in our day and age of low brow humor. Regrettably there are a couple of flatulence gags (I'm guessing primarily for the kiddies) that didn't need to be. But most of the other humor is keen, dextrous in execution and inventive in concept, and very British in overall gist.

Finally, as with most of Aardman productions, there's a knack for demonstrating the villain who has more tech wizardry as an expression of brawn to make up for brain, or lack thereof. It is a running theme in some of Aardman Production's films, notably the Wallace and Gromit series, and should serve as a nice little, almost subliminal, message to young minds as they mature into full adults.

Again, very delightful and very fun.

Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.

No dialogue films have been around since the beginning of cinema. The best could tell a thousand words through the mere glance of a character's eyes. But how does one do that with clay puppets? Very very slowly, with great detail, and with insurmountable patience. Each minute in this film must have taken days / weeks to complete. Were the camera anchored in position, perhaps it would have been easier. The camera in Shaun the Sheep never stays still. It pans, zooms, shifts focus -- while the claymation is MOVING! While not the first film to do so (Nightmare before Christmas is an excellent claymation film that did the same), it is done so seamlessly that you almost forget about the technical prowess in making it. All of this, of course, takes a back seat to the solid story and character development. 

How does one take 5 minute serial cartoons and stretch them out to a full length movie? By expanding the backstory to the characters, of course. All cartoon serials made into feature length films have done this, but never as effectively as here. I think the answer is simplicity. They don't go for wackiness as much as for tenderness. The farmer is shown to be more of a father figure to the sheep. The entire farm is portrayed as a family. That raises the emotional stakes in the film which makes the simple funny moments funnier and the tender moments more heart warming. In essence, the simplicity and lean running time elevate the whole production. It rises beyond its origins and leaves the audience exhilarated. This is a movie you feel good you've seen. There is a purity about it which is lacking in most movies. Appropriate for absolutely any age, check this one out!

This is a very late review because I am not one who needs to see every film on its release date  I often just wait until it is freely available on the internet. 

Whilst this is a film primarily aimed at a young audience as a 60+ year old I was entranced! I enjoyed myself enormously watching this. As a long term fan of Aardman I was not confident that this full-length movie would succeed and I expected to be a bit disappointed but I was wrong  this deserves 10/10! 

The plot is necessarily slow-starting for the first few minutes but it is never boring and it is not long before the storyline develops to become a roller-coaster of ingenious scenarios. 

Without any intelligible dialogue the film brilliantly combines an exciting visual storyline for children with the addition of many other references to adult-only scenarios  the most obvious being to the "The Silence of the Lambs" but I probably missed a few. This is the classical formula for a successful pantomime  to keep both the children and the adults entertained.

Although only an animation I truly believed in the characters and I cared for them. I wanted them to succeed! I also was often brought to tears of laughter with many of the scenes. 

This is not a film for children  it is a film for everyone!

This movie is going to win an Oscar or nominate one. Because that was a good movie! The animation was good too!

This is probably one of the best movies of 2015. More people need to see it. It's probably the name that made people refuse this glorious masterpiece. It was better than the last Wallace and Grommit movie. This movie is just fantastic. How could this movie have only 7.4 rating? How? It should be 8-10 because that was good!

I want a sequel, like, as soon as possible. That movie was awesome! If you are in for a big adventure, a nice, simple movie. You need to see this masterpiece. It is a really good movie.

Shaun the sheep quickly became one of the most beloved characters from the Wallace and Gromit world, after his appearance in A close shave, back in 1995. His popularity led to the creation of a very successful TV series, and the transition to the movies was only a matter of time. And the wait was definitely worth it.

In this feature-length adventure, Shaun and the rest of the flock decide to take a break from daily duties and have a good time by sending the Farmer to sleep all day, but things will go out of control when he gets lost and amnesiac in the big city. Then Shaun, the flock and Bitzer (the Farmer's dog) go to the rescue of their owner in a dangerous and unknown place for them.

All the Shaun the sheep characters have always been silent, and it could have been tempting for the directors to give them voices, but in a clever move, they chose not to do it, which allowed them to work brilliantly with slapstick comedy and providing truly hilarious gags using pop culture references such as Breaking Bad, The Silence of the Lambs, The Beatles and some others that movie fans will recognize.

Another advantage of not using dialogue is that through highly expressive characters, the movie is able to deliver thrilling sequences and touching scenes with no need of words (this is the moment to praise Aardman's refined style, since stop-motion is one of the hardest animation techniques to work with, but they've mastered in an extraordinary way), and for younger audiences has a lovely message about friendship, loyalty and dealing with responsibilities.

The Shaun the sheep movie is Aardman's return to form after some weak works and it's great to have them back.

Having only seen a few 'Wallace & Gromit' shorts and 'Chicken Run', I didn't have much expectations of 'Shaun the Sheep Movie'. I ended up loving nearly every second of it! 

The plot is simple: Shaun wants to escape his monotonous life for a day and played a prank on the farmer, which resulted in the caravan with the farmer inside to roll into the big city. Shaun then has to find him and bring him back to the farm.

The simplicity of the film shouldn't discourage adult audiences. The directors took a great risk because the movie has no real dialogue, so a complicated plot would probably make it boring and hard to follow for children, but because of that 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' exceeds in something where most comedies fail: visual gags and subtle storytelling. What children probably won't notice will be a delight for the grown-ups among the audience and I'm not only talking about the references to 'The Beatles' or movies like 'Cape Fear' and 'The Wolverine'. 

It's been a while since I have seen a stop-motion film, but i was surprised at how far stop-motion animation has come. Not only does it look fantastic, but is also incredibly detailed. One has just to look at the clothes the sheep are wearing while they are strolling around the city. Since most animated films outside of Japan are computer animated and especially because it was so well done, this film was a feast for the eye.

The only reason to I go to Nick is to watch 'Shaun the Sheep'. This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.

Stop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.

It was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.

Unlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.

As usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.

Being a fan of Aardman, I was very excited to see this movie. And I was not disappointed. Shaun the Sheep is a charming, funny, and entertaining movie that continues the tradition of good movies by Aardman.

The animation is beautiful. Claymation is my favorite type of animation because of how off-beat it makes everything look, so I'm already partially biased on the cinematography. That is a huge reason I love Aardman.

But, the backbone of any and every Aardman film, including this one, is the screenplay. Shaun the Sheep has a wonderful screenplay - full of wit, cleverness and humor. I can't tell you how hard I laughed at the Silence of the Lambs' reference (the only one in my theater who did laugh at it). There is a restaurant named "Moon," and, in the film, a cow jumps over itget it? It's the little things like that make this film so great. Without dialogue, this movie is still more intelligent than many. That isn't to say it's a silent film, but it doesn't have any talking. It doesn't need it. The saying, "A picture is worth 1000 words" applies to motion pictures as well. The way the movie uses images to convey messages or to tell jokes and to advance the story is impressive and entertaining. It makes us feel smart, that we're able to put the pieces together and not have to be told everything. I'd even say it's refreshing.

I wish I could say more about the movie, but it's excellence was so expected and it's formula is so familiar, that I can't elaborate too much. It's vintage Aardman, basically. Fortunately, that is a fantastic thing. So I give this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 10 to 18.
