and that would be, entertain.

I can't describe how many times I thought 'whoah!' it's one of those moments that could only ever happen in cartoons or 'whoa!' that was anime level crazy! This film set out to create a literal live action adaptation of a lovable & cheesy retro cartoon anime. That's exactly what it did.

Let's start with the PG rating, this was appropriate not because this film is 'aimed' at kids (which it wasn't clearly, as box office disconnect showed) but because it's a 'family' film for all ages based on a cartoon that most of the older generation watched when they were kids, the source material barely even bordered a 12A and yet the film managed to in fact surpass it's source material in maturity. 

Fans of anime will seriously lap this up despite what the recent comments have said. Not only has every care been taken to preserve elements of the source material but it also has those cool retro and also modern anime moments. Good and bad guys with crazy cartoon anime hairstyles, crazy over-the-top kung fu, elaborate motion line effects just like in mangas, crazy death defying races, cheesy as hell dialogue which fits perfectly in context! Performances were quite impressive given it's a predominantly 'kids' PG film and that they were filming against green screen.

I also commend the Wachowski's use of such a strong colour palette.They didn't tone it down or diverge from the theme and each scene had a contextual wash of colour.Serious or more intimate moments had darker shadows while remaining colourfully vibrant. They were bold and not shy about what this film was going to look like.

To the haters again i say ,'what exactly where you expecting? The Matrix with cars?, people getting there throats slit?, symbolic commentary on capitalism,corruption, religion or the new world order? Go into this movie expecting high adrenaline scenes and all campy fun that only a 60's anime adaptation can provide, but don't just to go and watch it just to 'see what the fuss is about' until you actually understand what the source material was like. That way the movie will exceed your expectations.

I don't have complete praise for this movie however, in that towards the end of the film they got a little overboard with the editing and i was really let down by the final antagonist type drivers. Speed seemed to have a harder time in the casa cristo race in the film where the other drivers were far more menacing. It seemed like 'Cannonball Taylor', 'Gray Ghost' and especially the bad ass, white haired yakuza driver (for musha motors by the way) were just a flash gone by and Speed just beat them without any problems at all. Let's hope they make more of a presence in any semblance of an extended/directors cut

I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Speed Racer- and his TV series - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the shows might be seriously critical of every little detail of the turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Tatsuo Yoshida's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some episodes of Speed Racer.

That aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so.

On an artistic level, it is extremely hard to think of any other movie that comes close to being in the same league. I did not see The Matrix, but I would say that anyone who liked Sin City for its cinematography and graphic elements, would love Speed Racer. The use of bright photography that's added behind a green screen makes for a far more dramatic effect. 

Take the artistic elements of this movie, and put it together with the amazing cast (both looks and talent) and throw it together with a very different but coherent plot, and you've got yourself an extremely enjoyable movie that is definitely worth seeing. And seeing at the theater no less! My hats off to The Wachowski Brothers, and the rest of the cast and crew for putting together something different for a change.

GO...

Everyone around me told me it was going to be terrible. Early reviews said that it was nothing special. With these planted doubts, I still went to see it in IMax. As of right now, it is the greatest experience I have ever had in a movie theater.

This movie was pure fun. The Wachowskis truly know how to take risks. They just took their art and ran with it. All the actors were terrific. I especially gives props to the actor who played the youngest Racer brother. Honestly, I thought that boy would sink the film but after seeing it, Speed Racer would not have been half as fun without him and the monkey.

This is most visually stunning film to date, with a climax that continues to climb and climb. I wanted to jump out of my chair and cheer for Speed at almost everything. Granted, the film was predictable, but I didn't care. I still held my breath at all the moments, asking myself if Speed would be able to pull it off. I've never smiled through a movie as much as I have with this one in a long time.

Huge 10/10 for Speed Racer and a big thank you to everyone involved in making this masterpiece. My kids will be watching this film. If there is a Speed Racer 2, I am there.

I have to say, it seems that those who hated it were obviously not doing their homework beforehand to know that SR is not supposed to be a thought-provoking film like The Matrix. It is based on a wonderfully simple cartoon with a simple message for kids. If anyone knows anything about cult fans, they want films to reflect the original medium as much as possible. Thus, if you go to a children's movie based on a child-friendly anime, expect it to be such and not some mind-blowing,challenging film. Especially these days, we need films like this one to take our minds off the usual violence and such found in so many other so-called family movies. Take it as it is, a great family flick for ALL ages to simply enjoy.

Above everything else, this movie is a visual feast that stays true to the cartoon. I think it is really unfortunate that so many critics are complaining about the visuals in this movie, because I think that they are truly fantastic. I can safely say that I have never seen another movie like this one, and I feel that so many movies are going to try to do what this movie did. A lot of the visuals really are beautiful bursts of color similar to what you find on the busy streets of Tokyo, and this movie is aware of that. It is like they took Shibuya and made it a hundred times as big and colorful. Only someone who has been to Tokyo will know exactly what the Wachowskis were going for in this film. After all, it is based on a Japanese TV show.

The acting is somewhat campy, but can also turn that gear into more serious acting. It can be funny, and then be heartwarming. Lots of the racing sequences are very over the top, but the movie knows it and does it well. The tracks are very creative, and I can only imagine how fun they were to design. If real racing was this exciting, I would watch it all the time. I can understand why this film made the race tracks so crazy, because who would really want to see two hours of regular race tracks with cars going around and around? The sound was also really impressive in this film. The sounds of the race cars were explosive and loud and if you see this movie in a good theater, it will make it that much better. The music is also very fitting and tasteful. Probably the only time I will hear "Freebird" without being annoyed.

Also the politics in this movie were excellent as well. I feel above all the message of this movie is that money corrupts art. This movie portrays Speed as more of an artist than a race car driver. A big corporation wants to sponsor Speed, but Speed knows that corporations are evil and are only looking to make more money. He is very dedicated to his craft, and does not want to sell out. Speed knows that corporations corrupt art, and so does this movie. You will not see one piece of product placement in this whole film.

So overall this movie is very self-aware. It wants to entertain, and it does exactly that. It wants to be different, and it does exactly that. Don't listen to those wimpy critics that didn't like this film because it gave them a headache. Many people said the same thing about Moulin Rogue, and that movie is fantastic too. Critics who complained about there being too much color should have brought a pacifier with them to the movies, because only babies would complain about how this film looks. Race to your theater to see it now.

Well, what you've got here is a case of audience/critic disagreement. Obviously, this movie will get bashed by the critics because of its cartoonish and campy mood, but that's just it: the world shown on screen by the Wachowski brothers is marvelous. The animation is perfect for the atmosphere they're trying to create. Don't go in expecting Matrix-esquire effects, because there aren't any bullet time scenes. The effects used are so fitting for this movie because they're almost cartoonish and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.

The film, an adaptation of the long running Japanese anime, revolves around natural racing phenomenon Speed (the wonderful Emile Hirsch) and his family, which somehow includes John Goodman and Susan Sarandon (whoever pulled off this casting deserves some kind of award). Oh yeah, and the casting directors managed to get Matthew Fox and Christina Ricci as well. What really stood out in this area is that everyone involved really understood the characters and the world that Speed Racer is supposed to display. It's not supposed to be overly serious, nor is it supposed to be that realistic either. With the warm performances of Hirsch, Goodman, and Ricci, you get transported into another world (isn't that the point of movies anyway?). Matthew Fox is also great as the mysterious Racer X, whose role is sort of misconstrued by the previews. He showed a different side that I didn't think he could on 'Lost'.

The visual effects, as I've said before, aren't going to be Matrix-esquire, but there are a few "whoa" factor sequences that had my jaw dropping. I also need to warn you that, if you can't take fast camera movements or rapid shots, be careful. It's not as bad as Cloverfield or Blair Witch (because the quickness only occurs in the race sequences), but I'd still try to grab a seat in the middle or back of the theater. The film is visually stunning outside of the races themselves as well. The buildings, the cities, the homes, the cars themselves...all beautiful.

The Wachowski brothers get an A+ for keeping the movie in the spirit of the show as much as they could (they really did a great job), however the film has a major flaw: a runtime of just under 2 and a half hours. That's a BIG no no for a movie that is obviously marketed towards kids, unless it has the names "Star Wars" or "Harry Potter" on it. The film also has a sensual scene or two featuring Ricci and Hirsch, not to mention occasional language.

My advice: don't listen to the critics, see this movie for the fact that it's pure entertainment for the audience, and it will take you away to a visually stunning world for a couple hours. Definitely an enjoyable movie for the entire family.

Personally I have never been a fan of the original animated series, and I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. After seeing the trailers I thought it looked kind of cheesy and over-done. After watching this I realized that the cheesy graphics, work to it's own advantage. This movie really caught a good look at Live action Speed Racer without losing the characteristics of the Cartoon. I didn't think even the Wachowski brothers could pull this off, but as usual, they did.

As far as the actors performances, Emile Hirsch did exceptional, but my eye was mostly on the brilliant performances by John Goodman, and new comer Paul Litt who plays Spritle, Speed's mischievous little brother. I recommend this for the family, don't wait for the DVD get to the theaters while this stunning cinematography is on the big screen!

Watching Speed Racer convincingly win a spectacular race nearly besting his brother Rex's course record is the mysteriously charismatic Racer X (handsome brooding Matthew Fox). Racer X's beautiful companion tells him, "He's going to be great." With restrained pride Racer X says, "No, he's going to be the best" "Speed Racer" was my favorite cartoon growing up as a kid. Speed Racer was the brave hero. But the truly cool hero was Racer X. Racer X was the shadowy masked racer, who was Speed's rival and amazing equal. However, Racer X seemed more Speed's protector than arch-rival. There is more to the Speed and Racer X dynamic and mythology that will go unsaid, although fans of this cult classic already know.

My bud Lauren invited me to a screening of the Wachowski Brothers' live action adaptation "Speed Racer". I gladly accepted, and told Lauren of the "Speed Racer" mythos. As both writers and directors, the Wachowski Brothers brilliantly bring to life the world of "Speed Racer". "Speed Racer" has a visually distinctive style all its own. The vibrant colors and breathtaking CGI racing sequences enthrall with velocity and emotion. There is even homage to a scene from the animated series as Speed's Mach 5 careens over a mountain road during a treacherous cross continent race, and plunges to almost certain doom. But no worries here. Set in what looks like the near future, "Speed Racer" is visual spectacle and precision-- surprisingly ground in its story of love and family. Emile Hirsch plays the intense Speed Racer, son of Pops and Mom Racer (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon). Speed's passion is being the best auto racer, and destined for greatness. In a touching scene of a mother's pride Mom confesses to Speed, "I am so impossibly proud of you" 

Speed lives in the shadow of his late brother Rex Racer. Growing up, Rex was Speed's hero, and the greatest racer there ever was. However, after a vehement disagreement Pops disowns Rex. Rex gains fame and infamy on the racing circuit until his tragic death in the cross continent raceThe Crucible. The Racer family grieved the loss of the elder son. Does Speed race to honor Rex or does he race for himself?

Now years later, Speed is offered a lucrative contract to race for Mr. Royalton (pompous Nicholas Elia) and his Royalton Industries. Speed rejects the offer choosing to remain with Pops Racer (Goodman) and the family business. Consequently, Royalton vows to destroy Speed. The determined Inspector Detector (solid Nicholas Elia) and Racer X enroll Speed to help them expose Royalton's international racing conspiracy. Against Pops' wishes Speed enters The Crucible along with teammates: Taejo Togokhan (Rain) and the mysterious Racer X. Speed is well aware that The Crucible claimed the life of his brother Rex. However, there is something hauntingly familiar about Racer X. For Speed: Is this merely coincidence? 

The Wachowski Brothers' narrative moves at a nearly blinding pace. Cleary, they have a reverence for the original cartoon. They even provide slick martial arts action, which "Speed Racer" had way back when. Racer X (Fox) powerfully dispatches ninja attackers. And Rain as Taejo displays amazing martial arts grace and style. The performances throughout "Speed Racer" are strong. Emile Hirsch captures the wonder and conflict of a young hero emerging into his own. Christina Ricci as Speed's girlfriend Trixie is smart and spirited. John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are incredible. Pops and Mom Racer may have been intended as caricatures; however, Goodman and Sarandon breathe humanity and a parent's love in their roles. They subtly reflect their pride in Speed, and painful regret for Rex. Matthew Fox is powerful and commanding as Racer X. Fox brings a nobility and grace to this mysterious hero, who embodies a Zen-like spirit to racing.

"Speed Racer" is spectacular fun with a surprisingly compelling story. Amidst the flashy eye candy and masterful CGI, "Speed Racer" is about the power of love, family, and the inherent greatness in all people. Take a chance on "Speed Racer".

My husband and I went to a screening yesterday. I honestly didn't think I was going to be super impressed or anything, and it'd just be a cute movie - but I was really blown away by it!! 

It's rated PG and appropriate for all ages. As a warning though, it's has really fast cuts and lots of colorful visuals, especially during the racing scenes, so little kids, like 4 and under (not to mention a few adults not used to the fast-pace) might be a little overwhelmed at first.

One of the things that I liked best about this film was that it was very innocent and stuck to its morals. It's one of those movies that you'd feel good taking your kids too, knowing that it's actually going to reinforce values instead of questioning them. However, it never got too serious and had the perfect amount of zany comedy. It was campy and fun.

I see a LOT of movies and typically get bored halfway through, feeling like it's the same thing over and over. But I had such a good time during Speed Racer! Sure I knew how the ending would turn out, but I ENJOYED getting to the ending. I was never bored, and very visually stimulated. There's a good balance between jokes for kids and jokes for adults, and the adult jokes never bordered on inappropriate (as some recent kid movies have), so that you wouldn't be able to explain to the kids why you laughed at a certain part.

All in all, this is a great film for kids, this is a great film for adults, this is a great film for teens! The only people I would not recommend this film to would be those who don't think they can handle very fast-paced cutting, but it's not any worse than the majority of video games nowadays, so if you can handle those, you'll LOVE Speed Racer!!

After reading seanwalker's review of Speed Racer, I feel compelled to write a positive review in light of such skepticism.

First off, this is not some stupid trolling endeavor. The guy who wrote that review is clearly intelligible, he just didn't get this movie.

Speed Racer, as do all Wachowski movies, has a theme: family. Speed Racer captures the ideal family in a realistic way, showing the conflicts between child and parents with the coming of age, first with Rex Racer and then with Speed Racer. In this film, the power of strength in family overcomes all odds, all conspiracies, and all evil. When all ideals of goodness seem to fade, family still remains strong. It may be a somewhat simple message, but the message runs deeply throughout the film, and, after all, this is a family movie.

Though the effects were likewise phenomenal, after Royalton's speech, you can't possibly say this movie isn't deep. Once again, the Wachowski's apply multidimensional philosophy into their film, a feat that hasn't been done before in a family film, at least not that I can immediately recall.

And finally, we are faced with everyone's biggest complaint about Speed Racer: the big cheese. The cheesiness will make you cringe occasionally, but that's not to say that it isn't intentional. Fans of the original series will tell you that the corniness and overdone comic relief were part of what made the series what it is. As the great Tarentino would do, the Wachowski's stay true to their original content, and not only include each character of the original series, but portray them as they've always been portrayed, with Racer X as the only character without a ridiculous, cheesy scene.

Speaking of Racer X, how about some praise for this movie instead of just counterargument! Racer X's portrayal is wonderful! This may be a spoiler, but honestly, if you don't know by now that "Racer X is really Rex Racer, the older brother of Speed who ran away from home years ago and is secretly racing behind the mask and the wheel of the number nine, the shooting star" then you probably need to go watch the series. As an older brother, I find Racer X to be a heart-wrenching character. Not only does he posses the inner fire to do whatever it takes outside of cheating to liberate the sport of his passion, but he will sacrifice even more for the good of his family, though disowned by them. He is the icon of sacrifice, passion, and, yes, badassery. And still, within a family film! If you're a fan of the series, you will love this movie. It has literally everything the series had, corniness and all, but also a deeper message about family. The racing scenes, which I have little about, are indisputably enamoring, fast paced, sleek, and full of the crazy stunts and devices the old series had. Any fan of the series will love this movie.

For everyone else, the cheese may be unbearable. Some people just don't feel the pull to be open minded to corniness, especially when it comes to family movies, and that's understandable, just make sure you know that this corniness doesn't spring from poor direction. Also, as with The Incredibles, those that don't relate so well to messages of family strength, or those that don't want to see a coming of age movie, no matter how well down, will also experience distaste for this film. But whether it's your cup of tea or not, this is a well done movie with depth, passion, and of course mind-blowing color and effects.

Speed Racer, blockbuster number 2 for the summer, based off the popular animated 60's cartoon, the first real "Japanimation" series, we have the now live action film. What was supposed to also be a family film, this film just flops on. First I'll start on the positives: bright colors, exciting effects, and it felt like a cartoon, which is what it meant to bring. However, this movie was overly long, if it's supposed to be for kids, so don't make it into a 2 hour and 15 minute film. Like one of the ending scenes where Speed has all these flash backs of earlier scenes, we didn't need it. Some of the dialog, it was decent but again, could have been shortened. Also, I know that CGI is a thing that will never die, but it's not my cup of tea, because it just takes away something special. But the story does deliver on it's fast paced race scenes.

Speed Racer has lived a fast paced life on the road, trying to live up to his "deceased" brother's world of racing. But all these sponsors are coming after him, but he wishes to stay in the family with his dad, mom, little brother, and Tricksey, his girlfriend. With the help of a mysterious Racer X, Speed wishes to beat the sponsors who threw things in his face and just make money off of him, and can just prove that he is the number one racer in the world.

Speed Racer, for a summer blockbuster, it's a decent enough film, however it does have it's flaws here and there. Now the one thing I was impressed with is that not only did they make it feel like a cartoon, but it was over all pretty faithful the the original cartoon series, so you get a real feel of the original story. I just think it was a little too long and the CGI was a little too much, it was almost like why did they even need the actors? Everything was probably a green screen, so what's the point in making it with human actors? But this is a fun movie for the kids with the bright colors, it just could have been shorter, because the kids will probably loose attention with the film. But for the 10+ year old's, they'll definitely get into it.

This movie blew past what my expectations would ever be. Having watched random episodes of the original anime, I was very skeptical as to how one could ever pull off making a live-action adaptation. The Wachowski brothers have pulled it off. The only way possible for this movie to be made was this over-the-top, campy romp through the race tracks. From beginning to end this film delivers a non-stop thrills. Even in the campy scenes that don't serve much plot purpose they held me in. Though it is very CG heavy and campy at times, there is some serious points where it does hit the dramatic mark and even had me emotional at one point. The end is obviously predictable but they do it so well and don't sell out to the really lame gags and rules of good guy - bad guy film-making. The acting was fantastic and they could not have gotten a better cast. This is great where kids can enjoy but also adults will as well with certain jokes and gags with a more mature sense to them I'd say. Old and new fans will not be disappointed. Go see "Speed Racer" go! 9/10

I really don't see any point in making live action movies from cartoons. I liked very much the "Speed Racer" cartoon, but this wasn't nothing like the cartoon. It was closer to atrocious films as "Spy Kids" and "Shark Boy and Lava Girl" rather than the original "Speed Racer":

-The visuals are terrible, mostly because of the CGI overload, as it was something directed by Robert Rodriguez.

-The performances were terrible and the characters were boring and flat (This may sound strange, but I think that the characters were more realistically portrayed in the cartoon) 

-The story was muddled, bland and boring.

Finally, I just want to say that this movie was so dumb and bad, just like all the live action movies inspired in cartoons.

This movie is bad. It's "Last Action Hero" bad, it's Ang Lee's "Hulk" bad, it's "Flinstones" bad, it's "Phantom Menace" bad. I started to get that sinking feeling as the opening act failed to find it's groove, jumping all over the place without giving the audience a chance to ground themselves. Supposedly this is a movie made for youngsters. If this was true, they would know enough to keep the running time to about 90 minutes. I can guarantee you that if the studio required the Wachowski Bros to shorten the run time, this movie would have been much better. They also should have known that you can't keep up this flashy visual style for over two hours, for it becomes repetitious and loses it's effect on the audience. The worst thing you can ever do for a summer popcorn movie is have long long monologues. My God, it's not a contest to see how many words you can use to describe the racing business. What were they thinking as we are inundated with countless close-ups spewing subplot after subplot. After about an hour of this claptrap, I just gave up trying to keep track of who was in trouble, who was friendly, it just went on and on.

The flashy editing didn't help with the racing sequences, because you are only given 1 second to figure out what's going on in a shot before it changes again. A few race sequences weren't fleshed out enough to get a sense of the endurance. We rarely see the actual start, and the flashy editing prevents you from keeping track of who is where, or whether they are winning.

I gave this movie a shot by seeing it on Imax, but it just made the nose hairs bigger.

Added 05/27/08: I am truly puzzled by the stark contrast in the reviews on IMDb. Many reviews were 10 stars and fawning over how perfect it is. I really can't see by any stretch of the imagination how this could be given a perfect score. Judging not only by the critical reviews but also the nearly empty theatres nationwide, it is NOT any kind of masterpiece. I am hesitant to guess, but perhaps these early reviews were planted? I was fooled in the past by early glowing reviews on IMDb (Swordfish comes to mind), and certainly am wary these days. Especially when the film is given 10 stars and described as if it is the most important achievement in movie-making. Speed Racer? I don't think so.

This movie was a disappointment. I don't know if the Speed Racer cartoon was ever shown in the UK - if it was, I missed it. But the fact that I've never seen the TV series is, I think, a reason why I may not have all the data I need to assess this film comprehensively. Because I don't think I am within the demographic which this film is aimed at.

Mind you, I'm not sure what that demographic is (other than middle-aged people who want to see the TV series translated into shiny new CGI - and that's an assumption on my part). One might think that the movie is a kids' film - it's full of bright shiny (bordering on fluorescent) colours, hyper-kinetic energy designed to appeal to the video game generation, and a simple-minded story. But then, and going with the story, there is much to put kids off - though simple-minded, I have my suspicions that kids aren't going to be too enthralled with the backstory of corporate corruption and, for a movie which runs over 2 hours (a long time for those restless little bums to stay on seats), there are several sections which are very very talky. I confess that I found it hard to stay awake through the main villain's attempted corruption of Speed.

There was a fair bit to irritate unindoctrinated adults, too - the immensely shudder-making younger brother and pet chimp take the chequered flag in this particular race. And, while I understand that this movie takes place in its own universe - a universe in which the laws of physics as we know them don't quite apply - I found myself getting very distracted by the randomness and inconsistency with which they were applied. OK, so you can race round mountain bends at several hundred miles per hour, and come to an abrupt stop without being pulped. But how come that out of the many, many apocalyptic crashes, the only one which actually harms anyone is Rex Racer (OK, I know, I know, but in terms of the impact on other characters). My, how dangerous this racing is - well, not really, you just get cocooned in foam or parachuted to safety.

I can't figure out the Wachowski brothers. Bound was a fabulous suspense thriller, wound tight as a watchspring. The Matrix was a groundbreaking sci-fi spectacular, with an interesting plot. V for Vendetta was a tolerable adaptation of a classic comic series.

But Speed Racer is grown from the same seeds as the Matrix sequels. Yes, there's some fabulous eye candy in it. But I also need something for the brain to get its teeth into. Where the Matrix sequels went to an extreme of overblown pretentiousness, it's almost as if the Wachowskis have gone to the opposite end of the spectrum here just to make a point. And neither extreme works.

Speed Racer was undeniably eye-catching, but I did not care about a single thing beneath the gaudy surface. Because there wasn't anything beneath that surface.

Even if you are not familiar with the original TV show, like me, you must know something about this classic Japanese anime. In my case I'm a big fan of the fantastic Mach 5, definitely one of my favourite cars of a TV show or a movie. So apart of my Mach 5 1/64 die cast car of Johnny Lightning, a bigger scale model of the same car and my action figures of Speed Racer, Spritle and Chim Chim that I own since I was very young, I have no other stuff of Speed Racer. Even that I'm not a fan definitely I had some expectations of this movie, of course mostly for "The Matrix", and when I looked the trailer it was so damn colorful and totally different of the original show.

The plot introduces Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) as a young boy whose only interest are the car races. Is not rare since his family dedicate all of their lives to this sport. His father (John Goodman) runs their little business and his brother (Scott Porter) is a great racer. With the narrative style of the film we are watching this and at the same time we are watching the present days of Speed Racer, now as the new sensation of the car races. The story of the film is quite simple having the classic new and talented sportsman, who really feels a passion for what he do, entering in the professional ambit where the business comes always first and the money is the principal "talent". Of course there is a message and the hopes that the racing sport could be an honest sport with only winners that really deserves that honor.

The plot is nothing new but still I really like it. But definitely the visuals are just great making the film sometimes a live action comic book, a surrealistic child adventure, overall whatever the Wachowski brothers wanted, I think, is here. For example sometimes the car races looks like everything you want except a car race and that looks really good of course with all the colors that are really unusual. But definitely my favourite visuals are the ones when is a total live action comic book; the scene of the fight in the mountains, during the Casa Cristo rally, is so damn great. In resume I love the visual part of the film.

The cast is good with many funny moments and a cartoon look, of course the are is not a magnificent performance that stand out the others but everybody seems with the correct role. I think Emile Hirsch was a good choice as Speed Racer and John Goodman looks really funny and quite different. He is no more Fred Flintstone. Ricci looks also quite different but still very beautiful as Trixie . The support cast is just good with Paulie Litt as Spritle and Susan Sarandon as Mom. That little boy and his chimpanzee had a really bizarre and funny scene with the solo of the song "Free Bird" as background.

Conclusion: Great visuals and a rare narrative style, with the faces of the characters in the entire screen, makes "Speed Racer" a worth entertainment. In my humble opinion this film is just underrated here and by all the critics. Anyway I think will be worth to go and see it on IMAX and also I think this film and "Iron Man" will be my favourites of this year's summer, just waiting to see what "The Dark Knight" and the new stuff of Jack Black ("Tropic Thunder" and "Kung Fu Panda") will offer.

I saw SPEED RACER on a movie channel and the film was barely watchable. Anyone who says this film is good is seriously delusional, knows nothing about movies or needs to see a psychiatrist.

This "film" had two major flaws (three if you count the script):

The first major flaw is the way it was filmed. It wants to be an live action version of the classic Japanese animated series, which was mainly flat renditions of the animated characters in simple color schemes and yet for the film the actors and sets were filmed with deep shadows, gradients, etc. The cinematography should have been simple with a minimal of details. Such as it was though it overloaded every inch of the screen with gaudy effects or color with the humans lost in all of it. Visually, it's a disaster from start to finish.

The second major error was the extreme overuse of transitions throughout the 2 hour running time. Practically every second (yes, SECOND) the Wachowskis used fade ins, fade outs, overlaps, cross dissolve, etc, not to go from one scene to another but from one shot to another within the same scene. For two whole hours. It's mind boggling bad, boneheaded and really makes me question if the brothers even know how to direct. Transitions are cool and fun from time to time but supremely annoying if overused and in SPEED RACER they don't overuse it, they ABUSE it which makes for a painful viewing experience. 

It's no wonder the film bombed. It's simply impossible to get into it with those two major flaws.

Point 1: Coming home from 1st grade in 1973 and watching Speed Racer, Ultraman and Johnny Socko and his Flying Robot is one my most cherished childhood memories. The whole imagery, the music and the style lodged dreamlike feelings, mysterious aura and even a slightly haunting (I don't mean scary) impact into me as a child. For kids my age at that time, this was the first (and only for the time) intro to those big, overdrawn eyes from Japan, and there was just something...weirdly enticing about it. (I'll admit that Trixie was my first childhood crush...probably explains why I'm so screwed up today).

Point 2: When released on DVD several years ago, I started to watch them again, 30 years later, and I'll admit, I was like....ummmmm...maybe I should have just left it alone. Just killed another cherished childhood memory, dude. BUT, watching them, even though I had to admit as an adult that the stories, dialog and animation sucked, watching them 30 years later STILL invoked those dreamlike sensations and mysterious aura, and I was glad for that.

I cannot fathom how ANYONE, who either saw Speed Racer at age six in 1973 or never saw it, or saw at age 6 in 2003 even in the context of modernized entertainment, can like this movie. Like the original Speed Racer, it lacks decent dialog, a decent story, and believable action. But it commits the cardinal sin of making its action completely incomprehensible. Yes, the original Speed had preposterous physics, with cars going straight up mountains, sideways along cliffs, and bad animation with nothing more rotating backdrops behind a static Mach 5 with spinning wheels. But even a 6-year-old like me knew what was going on! You know that a filmmaker is either lazy or don't know what they're doing when each shot averages about .3 nanoseconds in length. Did someone get crazy with the editing scissors or they just didn't know how to construct good, coherent action. I never once felt involved in the action sequences, much less could follow them.

Some have complained that this movie is too bright, uses too many colors, and should have an epileptic seizure warning, but that was the least of my beefs. Yes, I did jokingly say after it was over, "Too many colors...I need aspirin", but it wouldn't have been so bad if I could follow what the hell was actually going on.

The BIGGEST SIN of this movie?????.....They KILLED the Theme Music!!!! Where was it???? That was the best part of the original Speed Racer Cartoon!!!! ARGGGGG!!!!!! And I don't want to hear some excuse like it is "dated", kids today would like, etc. etc.....My daughters (6 and 11) watch the old Speed Racer cartoons with me and they love that song!!!!!

At the weekend I took my Nephew to see "Speed Racer". My Nephew is 12 years old. Midway through the film I leaned over to him and whispered, "What do you think?" and this is what he said to me.

"It's rubbish, man!"

My Nephew was right as well. "Speed Racer" is very rubbish.

I will admit that "Speed Racer" looks absolutely fabulous. It shows us a big, bright, day glow universe. A multi-coloured extrapolation of how somebody living in the 1950's would think that a car racing obsessed future would look like. Breathtaking production design.

However... Other than the great visuals, "Speed Racer" is possibly the emptiest, shallowest, dullest movie experience I have had in a cinema, since my misfortune in shelling out a couple of quid to see "The Matrix" sequels. Very long and very boring. (Sorry guys, but a 2 hours and 15 minutes running time for a film aimed ostensibly at small children is way too much). "Speed Racer" is all glittering surface without a decent script underpinning it.

Sigh... I know it's dull, but let's repeat the mantra once again, shall we?

Special effects alone do not a good movie make.

Personally I felt sorry for the cast in getting involved in such a clunker. Emile Hirsch had good notices in "Into The Wild" (I missed that one), and I thought he was funny in "The Girl Next Door", but here he is a personality vacuum and wears one expression of mild bemusement throughout the entire movie. Fine performers like Christina Ricci, John Goodman and Susan Sarandon are totally wasted. Lastly, the less said about Paulie Litt as Speed's irritating younger brother the better, and let's not mention the comedy chimp at all. Life is too short. (Whoops! Just did.)

A bad misfire, then, but in recent times I have learnt to expect nothing much from the Wachowski's. "The Matrix" had it's moments (the first DVD I ever had, fact fans), but the best movie they were ever involved in was the lesbian film noir "Bound" and that was released way back in 1996. I would love the Wachowski's to do something as good again, but I doubt that they will. They have discovered the paintbox of digital special effects and, as long as those films continue to make money, I doubt they will ever want to close the lid on the paintbox.

This tale starts with Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch), he is an aggressive, impetuous, and brave crack pilot to win breathtaking world races. He lives with his mom (Susan Sarandon) and Pops racer (John Goodman) who designs a fabulous car along with a mechanic(Kirk Gurry), the Match 5 . The proprietary of Royal Industries does him a lavish offer but he rejects it. And he also uncovers a dark secret about the biggest races are being fixed . Speed Racer must save the sport he loves and his family racing business. Then Speed join forces with his one time rival Racer X (Matthew Fox) to win ¨Casa Cristo¨ rally , a cross country race, competing against dangerous racers and a shifty Japonese racer(Rain) and ultimately the ¨Grand Prix¨.

This exciting movie contains thrills, action-packed, tension, suspense and overwhelming races, but also some commercial elements. This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie. Full of action, its complemented by silly comedy in charge of a little boy and a monkey. The picture relies heavily on the overlong and death-defying races that are incredible and magnificently made by 3D computer generator. The story moves like a supersonic bullet for most of its running time and the last generation of fantastic cars steal the show. Contrived beyond belief with spectacular races that play like video games, but slickly calculated to please 2000 audiences and children especially. Emile Hirsch as valiant racer is good, he's an instinctive, stubborn and valiant young man. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman are sympathetic as his affectionate parents and Christina Ricci is beautiful as his love interest. Colorful cinematography plenty of pastel and glimmer color by David Tattersall. Impressive and groundbreaking production design by Owen Patterson. Stirring and moving musical score by Michael Giacchino, usual of J.J. Abrahams movies. The motion picture is well directed by the brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski adapting the famous Japonese anime . The Wachowski, also screenwriters(Speed Racer, V for vendetta)achieved his big success with Matrix trilogy and here get another great hit.

This movie could have been half an hour shorter if it didn't have those stupid over long speeches in it. If the entire movie was one long race then it might have been good. Also the fact that his brother didn't die and got plastic surgery to look like Mathew fox was terrible.

He is his brother, then he isn't, then he is again. Make up your mind Andy and Larry. I also still believe that the movie would have be exctactly the same without the kid and the monkey. So overall i believe all the good bits were in the trailer, they could have tuned the colours down a bit and added a lot more racing. Iron man was sooooooooo much better ! enough said !

This is most terrible movie I seen in many years. I went to see this this movie in IMAX theater in Toronto, to see it best possible resolution and sound, such a waist of money and time. I have to say that I knew about this movie during it's post production, I was ready and waiting for it. Even visual effects were really bad, looks very cheap, just a bunch of cuts stitched together; it's like if TV show cuts, shots from home made music video, video game cuts and green screen footage shots were edited together by drunk dude. Totally underused Susan Sarandon, very confusing movie, super cheesy flick with lots of flashes, I even felt dizzy. Probably Wachowski got lazy after Matrix, they made this movie to get some fresh cash by advertising "from directors of Matrix", shame on you Wachowski. Although, 3 things were good, Christina Ricci always beautiful, 13 y/o Paulie Litt done really great acting, and car 3D models looks very good. 

Rest of the movie is just a garbage, simply trash...

There is no other movie that i can watch bits of that brings tears to my eyes. And i'm pretty sure its the whole package and not just one aspect of the film that does this. The combination of dialog, plot, and cinematography just kicks ass AND its a PG13 movie.

OK, lets talk about WHY this movie was made. Does anyone think it was made just for the money? Glad there's nobody that stupid. But was it made ONLY as a homage to the original Speed Racer? No again. The Wachowski brothers saw an opportunity to make a hugely exciting and original film that explores the concept of being so good at a particular skill that a fair description of it is magic or art. In this case, the skill in question is driving. The style of the film (lots of colour and anime thrown in where possible) embellishes this focus.

Combine this with the usual anti-capitalist themes the Wachowski brothers throw in to all their films (eg, doing things for money is bad, m'kay?) and its not hard to build a obstacle-laden plot that our hero must traverse to make it to the finish line. Some people are complaining about the plot, but i can't for the life of me see what's wrong - it serves to highlight the themes of the movie extremely well. If i must make a criticism it would be that the morals of the film are laid on with a bit of a trowel but as i understand that this is a movie for EVERYONE, i can cut the directors some slack when they are trying to make sure EVERYONE gets the point.

The last thing i would say is that, for me, i can define my friends by this movie. Anyone who isn't tempted to yell out 'Go, Speed Racer, go!' (i said tempted, you don't have to embarrass yourself like i did) is no friend of mine. If you weren't inclined to yell this out, please check you have a pulse.

I just don't hand out 10/10s willy nilly. If you give a movie the highest rating you are saying movies don't get any better. I find it highly ironic that in the same way Speed Racer (the character) would get a 10 for his driving skill, the Wachowski brothers deserve the same for their movie making. If i could give them a score 2 or 3 points higher than everyone else, then i would have to award 12 or 13 out of 10. A pity i can't. What ... a ... movie.

I just loved Speed Racer. It did an amazing job at entertaining, and overall the movie blew me away altogether. The movie may have became a little idiotic and somewhat uninteresting at points, but they did a very good job on the script and I loved all the awesome kick-ass action. One of my favorite parts is when they are fighting in the hotel bedroom, that scene was awesome, and I laughed at a lot of the cute jokes too.

I understand it was mostly all for thrills in the vision department, but that is what you should have been expecting when you went in to Overall Speed Racer exceeded my expectations, and in the end I was very glad I had the chance to view it, for I loved it and think it rises above a lot of other movies out there recently. It did not deserves it's Razzie noms. Give it one more chance if you did not like it.

I didn't have the opportunity to see this movie in the theater and I had to wait for the DVD. After reading the critics ratings, I didn't have high hopes for the movie and mainly bought it since I wanted to learn about some of the special effects on the bonus features. All I have to say about this movie is: WOW! It would be impossible to do a better job translating an animated TV series into a movie. They knocked this one out of the park. I was a casual fan of the series as a kid, so I am not one of those die hard fans who are either easy to please or impossible to please. Where to start? They perfectly captured all the elements of the series and managed to place it in one movie. This is a better translation to film then "The Dark Knight" was. That's saying a lot. Whoever cast this movie should get an Oscar. This was the best cast movie ever! All the actors hit their characters dead on. The special effects were just as impressive as when you saw "The Matrix" for the first time as well. Perfect is the word that best sums up "Speed Racer". I'm not one to give out many 10 stars, but this one definitely deserves it. All the critics who didn't give this movie a great score need to find new jobs. If you don't like this movie, you are definitely not a true fan of movies.
