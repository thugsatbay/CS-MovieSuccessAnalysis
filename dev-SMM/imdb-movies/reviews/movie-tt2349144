### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I think you'd be hard pressed to find a 2015 straight drama film that is more fun to watch than Mississippi Grind. I was really surprised at just how intelligent this film was while also being extremely entertaining. The premise and what I had seen from the marketing seemed to push the film in more of a 'Runner Runner' direction with it's tone and themes, but Mississippi Grind is much more than that. Not only is it great to watch Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn act alongside each other, but there's a surprising amount of depth to the story and it's characters that puts it up there as one of the best films of the year.

Focusing on Gerry, played by Mendelsohn, having a mid-life crisis as he's in major debt, divorced, and has a serious gambling problem. Enter Curtis, played by Reynolds, who adds excitement and 'luck' to Gerry's gambling life. The two are both very much lost in their own issues and their meeting feels more natural than it probably should. The strengths of the relationship and interesting dynamic ultimately goes to the two actor's performances. While Reynold's character is a happy go lucky guy on the outside, Reynolds adds so much more to him underneath. Same goes for Gerry, who should be an unlikable character considering he's in debt through self doing and even tries to steal money from his ex- wife, Mendelsohn grounds the character and the film to a perfect level.

Both the journey men go on various missions in hope of entering into a large buy in tournament in New Orleans, but you forget about that because you're more invested with what's going on outside of the casinos with these guys. The casinos add life to the film when it needs it and the poignant undertone of the story takes over at just the right time. It is a straight drama, but it's also very re- watchable just from the performances side of this film alone. To me, Mississippi Grind is one of the best directed films of the year. The story beats happen at just the right time giving it more depth than it probably deserves.

+Great lead performances

+Poignant script hits the beats at just the right time

+Entertaining and re-watchable

This is a film about two poker players who strike up a friendship and go on a road trip to win their fortune. The problem is that one of them doesn't know when to quit. This is one the best films I've seen about gambling and poker in a long time. The two lead actors , Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn are brilliant and they work really well together. Mendelsohn in particular is really convincing as man with a severe gambling problem. This doesn't glamorise gambling at all and it highlights all the pitfalls of not being able to stop gambling. Essentially this is a road movie that despite having many bumps is actually a really good journey to be on for the viewer.

Once again the IMDb user rating fails to reflect the true quality of a movie and I have to side with the critics. So be it because I was surprised how much I liked Mississippi grind. The acting from the two leads was exceptional, particularly Ben Mendelsohn. The writing is very natural and realistic as well. As usual, I would normally side with users, but every once in a while (such as with the guest) the critics know what they're doing and quite frankly the users couldn't be any more wrong, with a rating of 6.4/10 I would call this film criminally underrated, just so you know I don't say that often.

To steer haters away I will tell you this movie can be quite depressing at times, it's writing and acting is so raw that the emotion and situations really get to you. I don't know about you but any weird feelings this film gave me were on a positive note (quality wise anyways). I love different movies, on first glance I was thinking this was just another gambling movie, you know what I was wrong. This film does things not many other films have done, such as the feelings it gave to me.

I love and I mean LOVE different movies, and this film is quite different, full of lots of bits that are left un said and yet if the viewer is immersed properly they will feel it and it works and it really worked for me. Yes the characters in the movie have a gambling problem and it can be quite un comfortable to see what they do themselves and others but you know what not every movie is going to have happy go lucky optimistic heroes, so if you don't like movies with characters that aren't picture perfect steer clear.

I apologize for my rather vague review, I am coming right off of my initial viewing so keep that in mind but don't think of this as a review but more as a recommendation. I'm not saying this is the best movie ever but for those such as myself in search of something different I would highly recommend this film and I would put this up with some of the greatest gambling movies EVER. Initially I give this a 10/10 but as I said I'm fresh out of the viewing so I have to give this movie some time to absorb to give a more proper assessment, but no doubt Mississippi Grind is worth a viewing. Thanks for reading my recommendation and hopefully you'll enjoy this hidden gem.

Mississippi Grind is an independent drama film starring Ben Mendelsohn an Ryan Reynolds. Mendelsohn plays Gerry, a joylessly committed gambler whose addiction to the tables in backwoods Iowa casinos has cost him his marriage, the chance to see his daughter grow up and his integrity. Further along into the film, we see a developing relationship between both leads. Curtis (Reynolds) is an enigmatic fellow poker player who shares his love of Woodford bourbon. The film is more of a character study slower paced drama which has a very anti-mainstream feel about it. Which is case in point where the film has been critically acclaimed by top critics but criticized for being boring by casual fans. Overall, Mississippi Grind is well acted, an interesting story for those interested in the world of gambling and addiction. Yet the film did leave questions open, and the ending could have been more developed.

With the picturesque road trip surrounds of the American South at its disposal and the unique pairing of Australian ex-pat Ben Mendelsohn and Deadpool himself Ryan Reynolds, Mississippi Grind comes off as a sadly low key disappointment that could've so easily become so much more.

Filmed by directing duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who are arguably most well known for the Ryan Gosling starring drama Half-Nelson, Grind is proficient and professional but it lacks a heart. A coldness inhabits the entire film that keeps the audience at arm's length from getting emotionally invested into our seemingly odd couple pairing of Mendelsohn's troubled gambler Gerry and the somewhat mysterious and kindly natured Curtis who Reynolds could've played in his sleep.

Frustrating would be the best way to describe the film for a lack of a better word and you're constantly left on a knifes edge waiting to learn more about our two main protagonists or for the film to truly hit an emotional home run but it sadly never comes despite a suitably tense final few scenes and the likable leads doing their utmost with their roles.

It may be broken record time but once more Grind see's Mendelsohn deliver another on song performance and it's great to see him given a lead turn in a Hollywood production. His Gerry isn't a totally likable human being and it's a character that see's Mendelsohn once more play to the downtrodden side of humanity but he does it so well that there's no reason for him to stop anytime soon and he creates chemistry with Reynolds that at times threatens to elevate the film to a whole new level yet sadly the narrative never goes to the ends needed for this to happen.

A fantastic chance to once more see Australia's very own Ben Mendelsohn ply his trade like the best of them in an overseas production and a film that's unique in many ways, Mississippi Grind is a fine movie that had it featured a little more heart and soul and a more meaty narrative, is a movie that could've been something truly special. A winning hand then, but in no way a big time jackpot.

This is right up my alley. I enjoy gambling films, and like both actors.

"Mississippi Grind" is a great film bolstered by the chemistry and performances of the two leads. 

The film steady rolls out of the gate. Like the Mississippi itself, it doesn't seem to be in a hurry, but it keeps rolling towards it's destination. 

This is not a film of twists, cons, or gimmicks. It's a realistic examination of two gambling addicts, who find friendship and success despite their differences and problems.

Mendelsohn gives an Oscar worthy performance. "Gerry's" life has been permanently scarred because of his addiction. Think of William H. Macy in "The Cooler", or Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Owning Mahoney" and then up the ante(and that's saying something - especially the latter). I doubt he'll actually get a nomination. I already knew this was one of the best lesser- known actors in Hollywood. I'd seen many Australian films starring Mendelsohn, but many might recognize him from his supporting roles in films like "Place Beyond the Pines", and "Black Sea". This performance should catapult him into some bigger roles in American film.

Here Mendelsohn can't seem to get out of the way of himself. He's fallen so far that he believes that he deserves every bad thing that comes his way, yet he still can't stop his actions. It's like any addiction. There's usually a good person underneath there, but unfortunately, the weight of all his transgressions needs to be lifted before there is any chance at redemption. But, can the weight ever be lifted? I think that's the open-ended message and question at the end of the film. That's also why the ending works so well. It takes such a depressing character, two of them actually, and leaves us with the thought that they can right every wrong.

Mendelsohn's "gerry" also has a somewhat likable, light-hearteded quality in his depressive state. It's magical really. You'll leave the film thinking that you may run into Gerry at your regional casino; passing by and casually saying, "Hey Gerry". "Hey Man" he'd quietly reply, wondering possibly worrying about where he knew you from as he headed to the poker room.

The only thing that separates these two characters, is luck. Nothing more. Each of them imprint on one another, and the result is a revelation for them both. They need each other. Gerry needs Curtis' luck, and Curtis needs Gerry to justify that he can turn his own personal life around, that people like them can make a good decision. Proof that it's not all luck. Proof that he can quit and machu pichu(have to see it).

Highly recommended. Sitting right with "Wild Tales" for my top film of 2015, granted I've only seen 27 of 80 on my watchlist. As Gerry might say "It's a Sign" that better movies might lie ahead.

You'll like this if you liked: Trees Lounge(not as good), Owning Mahoney(very close but not quite as good as this), The Cooler(not as good), or Rounders(close but not as good, though I'm sure the comparison and statement won't help the useful %).

There's nothing worse than a movie that is out of touch with reality and the issues that it is supposed to be portraying, so I approached 'Mississippi Grind' with caution and was half-expecting an inaccurate and unrealistic depiction of a gambling addict.

I was pleasantly surprised - the movie was well written and acted, with two great performances from Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds as Gerry and Curtis. The movie places more emphasis on content and dialogue than anything else and is somewhat pedestrian, but still manages to be engaging.

I thought this was a solid and commendable attempt at portraying a gambling addiction. Certainly not a perfect movie but a well-made and accurate one, which is what I had hoped for.

This film tells the story of a compulsive gambler who is in fell debt. He hopes to make the money back on a road trip to various casinos, travelling with a young charismatic card player.

"Mississippi Grind" may be very realistic in the portrayal of a compulsive gambler. Ben Mendelsohn gives a very convincing and intense portrayal of the gambler. His expressions of exhilaration and desperation are very captivating, that I feel his emotions too. The scene where he loses the horse race towards the end is very memorable. 

The plot is a rather sad story of how compulsive gamblers lose everything, from money to family and even their integrity. It is a captivating story.

Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) and Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) are professional card players and degenerate gambling addicts. They begin a friendship over a card table and in a bar. Curtis is looking to visit Peru. Gerry has left behind his family. The two gamblers go on a meandering journey of addiction.

Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds are great actors. Mendelsohn is especially great in this one. The plot does need a device to drive it. Without it, this is just a series of scenes strung together, and there are some interesting scenes. I like Analeigh Tipton doing her magic tricks. I like Gerry stealing money from his ex-wife. The gambling doesn't hold much interest without a ticking money counter. Even with a win, these two will eventually lose again. That is the basic flaw. Even the ending is not the final ending. There is no real climax.

Two powerful performances from Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds carry this gritty gambling flick. Mendelsohn is pitch perfect as Gerry, a lying and conniving compulsive gambler. Reynolds is also excellent as Curtis, a free-wheeling and gregarious guy, who meets and befriends Gerry at a poker room, in a Dubuque, Iowa casino.

They decide they will travel together down the Mississippi on a gambling odyssey, with the ultimate goal of playing in a high stakes poker game, in New Orleans. At times, the talented filmmaker duo of Ana Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Sugar) capture the tone of the gambling experience perfectly, while towards the end of the movie it enters fantasyland to some degree, in my opinion. There's even illustrations of the very dark masochistic tendencies that can be shown by a gambler, which reminded me of the classic 1974 film "The Gambler".

All in all, although this movie may appeal to only a certain slice of viewers, I found it intriguing enough to maintain my interest throughout, and wonder how it would all turn out, led, as mentioned by two superior portrayals by Mendelsohn and Reynolds.

I have a weakness for gambling films having grown up in a gambling family. This film does a lot better then most in defining two common but distinct gambling types and then having some great actors bring them to life. Reynolds oozes charm in the easier role while Mendelsohn channels the 1970's in depicting Gerry who is utterly unlikable and yet dominates every scene.

This is a film in which character and sense of place are nailed while the story and structure are scuttled. Sometimes you can get away with it but this film commits too many sins. The film meanders over 148 minutes, a tightening would have sharpened it immensely but the worst is the dreaded fourth act. Had the film ended at the racetrack and not had a ridiculous denouement 20 minutes later it would have fared so much better.

Watchable just to see some actors spread their wings.

"Mississippi Grind" is a very good drama that keeps you enthralled largely due to the strength of its performances. It follows two gamblers, one compulsive and down on his luck, the other younger, more charismatic, and luckier. The first uses the second as a good luck charm.

There are some truthful, depressing scenes involving Mendelsohn as the degenerate who has ruined his relationship with his wife and daughter and can't stop. These scenes feel raw in the best way. You feel like you are watching something real, and it's painful but gripping.

If you have seen a few movies about compulsive gamblers, you probably know how this one is going to end. If you know anything about compulsive gambling, you also probably know how this story would end in reality. It's not that you want a bleak ending after getting to know these characters, it's that you know this illness isn't cured by success.

Ben Mendelsohn & Ryan Reynolds in a sleazy gambling movie. Chasing the win that will solve everything. Not glitzy Vegas but drab gambling starting in Iowa & then down the Miss. River. Sometimes in lesser casinos, gambling riverboats and private poker games and once in a while at a track. Ben M. does the heavy lifting acting. All rumpled & down on his luck. Not violent & demented like the Bloodline brother but similar look & bad luck. But R.R. does a damn good job too. Sienna Miller is listed on posters etc b/c she is popular but she's barely in it. These people all have teeth that are too nice for the characters they are playing. I don't think these people are making it in for a 6 month cleaning all that often.

Contrary to what you might believe from what you see playing at your local multiplex nowadays, there are still serious movies being made that have that 1970s vibe - you just have to look a little harder for them, mainly with what's coming out from the indie film industry. "Mississippi Grind" is one such example. It's definitely not a movie for everyone - there will be many people who will complain that the movie doesn't really have much of a plot. It's more of a character study with a vignette structure. If you are prepared for that, the movie does have a fair amount of interest. The two central characters played by Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn are written to be interesting people on the fringe of society, and both actors give solid performances. The movie is a little long and could have been tightened somewhat, but all the same it offers a thoughtful study of people for those who want to take a break from Hollywood blockbusters.

Mississippi Grind is a film about gambling  or more rightly gambling addiction. It stars Ben Mendelsohn ('Slow West') as Gerry a divorced father who is in real estate. He has sunk pretty low and owes everyone money  he has 'the next one will be a winner' type attitude. Then he meets Curtis  played by the always good value Ryan Reynolds. They meet at a card game and sort of hit it off and lo and behold seem to be good for each other and their gambling.

What follows is a road trip of sorts which is punctuated by their need for a fix - that is more gambling. These guys will gamble on anything  even what eye wear the next guy coming out of the washroom will have on. Essentially both men are losers but ones who are both essentially likable. The portrayal by both leading men manages to illicit sympathy for both men despite the warning signs that these men are self destructive.

Now I really enjoyed this but it is missing something and that is the heavy dose of realism. 'Gambleaholics' rarely quit  they just go broke. Part of this is shown by Gerry who will stoop lower than a snakes belly to feed his habit. However, the ending for me fell kind of flat. One of the recurring themes of the film is that 'the destination is the journey' and it is for that self same reason that I am awarding the mark I have. This is a good journey  sadly the ending left it firmly in Narnia which was a shame and a dodged issue as far as I am concerned. I have known and still do know gambling addicts and they are wonderful people who invariably will lie, steal, rob  anything as their lives spiral downwards. It is a shame that the truth for the majority was glossed over by a feel good ending that spoiled the film.

Sometimes gambling issues can be a major problem. Well actually most of the time. Even if gambling is not your major concern, you might have other issues. In this case the (always) suave Ryan Reynolds is having different problems, than our main character. Those two seem to feed of each others problems. It's like the complement each other and while they fight from time to time, they also seem to need each other.

Another reviewer wrote about the lack of redeeming characters in this. But you don't always need a clear cut character or one that is above the other. This is a weird friendship road trip, that takes us with it, on a journey, that might not be what we'd like to see. But it takes us places (some of them very dark) of human nature, that people might fall into. It's not about tendencies it's about lack of commitment and an addiction personified ... Very well acted

This is a great comedy about friendship and taking chances. Reynolds and Mendelsohn have a great chemistry and also deliver amazing individual performances. The way Mendelsohn portrays emotions and feeling with his body is simply one of the best body acting performance I have ever seen. Also the cinematography is genius. With plenty of medium shots and close ups the camera captures all the emotions and makes the scenes even more intense and the viewer feel for the character. What I also really liked was the fact that in this movie the younger man is a role model for the older man, which is a rather uncommon concept in this kind of movie. And for every Ryan Reynolds fan out there, this is probably his best performance right after Deadpool ;) All in all I can say that this is a very well made movie that is less about gambling and rather about people and the power of believe and friendship.

Questionable entertainment value, watching two '" train wrecks" happening at the same time. It's a buddy road movie with the theme being the pathetic lives that are the result of compulsive gambling. Two losers like Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds play certainly don't deserve any glorification. The low point is when Mendelsohn tries to steal money from his ex-wife. The acting is good, however the story meanders, and at times is sleep inducing. You do get some nice photography of various towns along the Mississippi. What is not so nice is the toxic effect their gambling addiction has on their relationships. Both characters come across as self serving jerks, with little regard for anything but their own destructive behavior. - MERK

Just a few quick points, not a full review. I feel compelled to add my alternate comments as so many reviewers seem to think that this is a "true" or "accurate" portrayal of a compulsive gambler. In my opinion it is not a true or accurate or real life portrayal of the life and luck of a compulsive gambler. Some parts, like any addiction ring true, like searching his ex-wife's sock drawer for a fix of cash for the next gamble. In this single act loosing his self respect and any respect or trust that his ex-wife may have held for him. However, towards the end of the film, in particular, contact with reality and true or accurate real life is lost. Blackjack gambling winning hand after hand after hand is truly the stuff of film fantasy and not what happens in the gritty real life, furthermore the soppy, sugary end to the film is frankly ridiculous and way off kilter to a realistic story. Addictions, of any kind do not end happily. So to conclude, the film is not realistic and cannot be construed or expected to be so, that said, it was a very enjoyable watch and the lead played his part perfectly, well done.

I liked Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's 2008 film Sugar, about an aspiring Dominican baseball player trying to break into the big leagues. The writing-directing team is known for thoroughly researching their subjects and this time they have turned their attention to the subject of gambling. After viewing Mississippi Grind, I'm thinking that perhaps Boden and Fleck should direct someone else's screenplay next time around. 

"Grind" is not short in the acting department. The protagonists here are Gerry, a hopeless gambling addict played by the talented Australian actor, Ben Mendelsohn, who replicates a passable Iowan accent and Curtis, a "professional" gambler, played by the engaging Ryan Reynolds (seen recently in Woman in Gold).

The plot proceeds lugubriously as Gerry and Curtis meet one another in a Dubuque casino and soon become fast friends. Things get a bit interesting when a criminal inside a pool hall comes to believe Gerry is loaded with cash after the inveterate gambler can't convince a group of bar patrons to accept his $1,000 bet on a pool game. Outside in the parking lot, the man stabs Gerry after discovering that he's indeed broke. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on how you look at it), the wound isn't serious enough from keeping Gerry away from his next "pit stop." 

We also learn that Gerry owes many people money including Sam (Alfre Woodard) who reluctantly warns him that she'll have to have one of her friends come after him if he doesn't make good on his debts. Curtis however proposes a trip to New Orleans where there is a poker tournament with a $25,000 buy-in. Curtis agrees to lend Gerry $2,000 for gambling purposes if he does the bulk of the driving.

The two travel to St. Louis where they fraternize with two prostitutes. We learn that Curtis has had a prior relationship with one of them (Sienna Miller), but the sub-plot doesn't really go anywhere. Gerry ends up betting $20,000 on the river card in a poker game and loses it all but tells Curtis that he won. The two friends then go to Little Rock where Gerry pays a visit to his ex-wife and is caught by her rifling through her drawer, attempting to steal a wad of cash. She promptly throws him out of her house. 

When attempting to check in at a hotel in Mississippi, Curtis' comp card is rejected and Gerry reveals he lost all his money playing poker. Curtis provokes a group of tough guys in the hotel bathroom and after he leaves, they beat Gerry up.

At this juncture one is left with more questions than answers. How does Curtis really make a living? Does he simply keep getting lucky like when he bets on Mississippi Grind at the horse track and walks away with a cool $5,000? And why does he place himself in harm's way at the basketball pick-up game, intentionally welshing on a bet so that he ends up getting beaten up?

Worse is the climax where Curtis runs into Gerry at a casino and Gerry makes a single $285,000 bet in a craps gameand wins! Does the degenerate gambler who earlier attempted to rip off his ex-wife by stealing money from her homehas he redeemed himself by giving up gambling and now acting responsibly? The idea perhaps is that because Gerry leaves half the money in the safe for Curtis, and doesn't steal it, the films' scenarists are perhaps implying that Gerry is soon going to go on the straight and narrow. But given his entire history of addictive gambling, is it really likely that he's going to pull himself together? The bottom line is that Gerry really hasn't redeemed himself at film's end and what he did to his ex-wife leaves such a bad taste in one's mouth, that it's difficult to root for him at all.

Ultimately Mississippi Grind should be a cautionary tale about gambling the Gerry's of this world more often than not end up on the losing side of life. Through a sleight of hand, somehow Gerry and Curtis get a free pass from Boden and Fleck, who are more enamored with the fleeting charms of their characters than the reality of their compulsive game of self-destruction.

I am warning you this might be a pun grind by reading my review of Writer-Directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck's independent movie "Mississippi Grind". But I promise you it will be fine, well maybe not. The vastly underrated (just my opinion) Ben Mendelsohn stars as out-of-luck gambler Gerry. He resides in Iowa, but really is living in the state of "I owe all of you" due to his gargantuan gambling debt. In one of his poker dealings, Gerry meets Curtis; he is the suave gambler full of stories that takes a friendly liking to Gerry. Curtis is played by Ryan Reynolds. Gerry and Curtis team up and take it on the road to deal with the cards that have been handed. OK, maybe not. But they do take it on the road, to try to make some gamble winnings in New Orleans, St. Louis, and yea Mississippi. Boden & Fleck's narrative is not overwhelmingly superb, and they are not really "jack of all cinema trades" filmmakers. But they do develop an adequate road trip movie that is built upon the winning chemistry between Mendelsohn and Reynolds. Both were excellent with their performances but I would double down more a bit with Mendelsohn's rousing performance. It's in his bloodline I mean lifeline for Mendelsohn to get an Oscar in the future. The rest of the cast needed a bigger wheel to spin with, especially Sienna Miller's useless character Simone who plays an intermittent love interest of Curtis. But it was not a big loss to deal with. It's your call, but I think you should take the gamble and visit on the "Mississippi Grind". **** Good

Ben Mendelssohn is a strong actor. His American accent is flawless. As the main character he has a convincing performance with Ryan Reynolds. But the plot is slow, and meanders. Found myself waiting for the point of this film... You have read into this film to get its value. I found it hard viewing because of the glacial pace of the plot.

As both characters pursue the fast money of gambling you see the ups and downs. At times the characters do things that just don't make sense. This adds to the painful viewing trying to work out what the point of this movie. It's not that deep frankly, as you see the typical behaviour of gamblers wrestling with their addiction and if they can overcome it.

While "Mississippi Grind" may seem like a generic gambling movie that builds up to some final Vegas showdown - and at times it seems so - it's more of a road trip movie. It's about little moments here and there, and the drama doesn't come from the gambling. It comes from the characters and subtle reveals about them. 

It's a movie about those little things that make us human, most of all involving people who aren't bad people in a sense, but live a very unfulfilling life, having troubles to actually change their lives (or not even wanting a change) but still having some child-like hope. I challenge you to not see yourself, or even a piece of yourself in some of these characters. 

Many people will not like the fact that there really isn't a point to all of this. There isn't a character arc where one person overcomes everything and learns all of the life's hard lessons. There isn't a moment where you totally understand a character and all that he/she is about. There is an end, but it isn't a closure. And while that did bother me too to some extent, perhaps that was the point.

Ryan Reynolds and (especially) Ben Mendelsohn are very good. Both have a sense of realness to them, and their chemistry is visible. In fact, there are no poor performances in this movie. Supporting actors are all very good, so thumbs up for them. Yvonne Landry, Kerry Cahill, and Stephanie Honoré come to mind, but everyone involved was very good. Writer/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have to mentioned as well, good work.

I have to compliment the soundtrack. There's a lot of good old "real" music to this film, like a road movie should have. It's used just right, not cynically trying to imitate a road movie soundtrack, but actually being a good road movie soundtrack. Most of the music is even played at bars.

To summarize: "Mississippi Grind" doesn't seem to have a larger scheme in the traditional sense, but it's a well-acted, well-written and subtly directed little drama. Much like a road trip itself, where little things here and there make you think and feel something, the drama follows suit in a similar fashion. Don't expect a tight, compelling story, force-fed character motivations or even a powerful closure, and you might just enjoy it. I did, and I'm glad these kind of movies are still made.

Not a terrible film, loved the soundtrack, enjoyed the actors performances, great locations but the story itself seems to meander at points to nowhere.

It's not as predictable as a lot of other films centralised around gambling (there are a few cliché moments, as to be expected). I do think its possible that our exposer to films revolving around this theme give you a feeling of despair throughout, dreading the outcome, and basically feeling uncomfortable and hopeless. But its not all cry's.

Character development was a little lacking, you like Curtis, and desperately want Gerry to do the right thing, but your never 100% sure why.

If your feeling serious, and are tired of most of the bubblegum films produced purely for box office ratings, its a great thought provoking offering. Worth a watch if your in the right frame of mind.

Casinos are an attraction for both Curtis and Gerry, yet for different reasons. For Gerry it is the lure of money and chance to change his fortunes. Curtis seriously doesn't care about winning and goes just because he likes to meet interesting people. Both are loners, although for Curtis it is more of a choice. He likes women too much to marry one. Gerry is separated from friends and family because he can't break his gambling habit. Both find something to like in the other. They form a pretty good team by helping to round out weaknesses in each other. Soon they are driving alongside the Mississippi River together and stopping at casinos along the way. What they have in common, a love of action and taking chances, may prove the undoing of one or both of them. Ryan Reynolds (Curtis) and Ben Mendelsohn (Gerry) provide life to the characters. The film is also given energy and verve from a funky Blues soundtrack. I wish, however, there was a little more depth in terms of dialogue, story and action, to the film. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.
