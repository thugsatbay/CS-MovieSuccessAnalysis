### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Taking place in New York City about now, "Mistress America" focuses on the life of Tracy who is a freshman in college. She aspires to be a writereasy to tell because she's aloof, detached, alone, and looking for friends. Her mom's getting remarried so Tracy has an older sister-to-be in Brooke, one of those cinematic forces of nature like a young Katherine Hepburn, perhaps. Brooke takes Tracy into her life of late-night concert performances, high-output spinning, fashion, finance, clandestine apartments, absent lovers, and a nascent restaurant business. In many ways, this is a buddy movie as Tracy learns fierce independence from Brooke, who she greatly admires.

Like all buddy movies, Tracy's and Brooke's relationship has ups and downs, complicated by the literary understory. Then the whirlwind pace goes surreal as the New Yorkers head to Greenwich, Connecticut in search ofsomething. We think it's one thing but it's not. I guess Greenwich, seat of the uber wealthy in the US financial arena, is actually a surreal place.

This is an intensely witty movie with a very chewy script handled ably by the very smart cast. Many call "Mistress America" a comedy but funny is clearly not this movie's main goal. To call it a "screwball comedy" is to not properly describe its intellect. The movie is saying something about envying the lives of others, which most of us do to one extent or another. It's a thoughtful movie, and it will be uncomfortable for some to watch if you, like Tracy, are not centered within your own mind and body. And after all, who is?

We saw this movie thanks to the San Jose Camera Cinema Club.

Tracy is a freshman student with no friends and a superiority complex (do we have a correlation here?), who's disillusioned that her lack of popularity isn't suddenly transformed when she moves to New York and starts college. It obviously didn't occur to her that wherever she goes she'll still be herself. It is also a rude awakening for her to find that once at college her assumed genius does not set her above those around her now she's in a more competitive peer group - in short she's not only dull but decidedly average as well.

Feeling particularly low she latches on to her "older" step sister to be Lola, a Bohemian human twitter feed who sprouts a constant diatribe about anything and everything, has no discernible talent, who seems to think her "popularity" will somehow equate to success, and yet somehow has made it to 30 without having to face the reality that it won't.

Of course Tracy recognises that Lola is a long overdue car crash waiting to happen but cynically hops on for the ride as a source of material for her writing. So both physically and metaphorically they set off on a journey that allows Lola to realise her short-comings forces for Tracy's to hold up a mirror to her own life, though neither seem to do much with this new found self-knowledge.

Because college students in films are invariable played by actresses and actors in their mid-20's the actual age gap between the "sisters" is somewhat less than it's supposed to be so the pair look more like contemporaries than big and little sister which gives an air of unbelievably to their relationship. Not a lot happens in the film, there's no great character arcs, both the characters and dialogue are unbelievable - it comes across as a pseudo-sophisticated Woody Allen stage play that's inexplicably been put on the big screen. It's not terrible, there are some laughs, but like Tracy it comes across as both mediocre and ultimately forgettable. At least at less than 90 minutes it's short enough not to overstay it's welcome. Perhaps it will say more to Americans or more specifically New Yorkers, given the importance of the location to the narrative.

There are several reasons why Mistress America may be considered a wonderful movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a very sophisticated sense of humour. The main actors all have exaggerated characters that always behave in certain ways (kind of like the cast in The Office) -- and the actors play these roles to perfection.

The writing and delivery of dialogue in the climax of the film is particularly amazing, with fast, witty exchanges filled with little jokes. Yet, the movie vacillates from hilarity to melancholy without warning the viewer, which makes the film all the more special.

The depiction of and commentary on NYC, youth, etc. is all spot on, making this movie worth the watch.

Finally, the soundtrack is excellent too, giving the movie a very alt/indie feel. 

Many negative reviewers sadly fail to appreciate the sophisticated writing and humour, along with the truly wonderful job that the lead actors have done in this unpretentious flick.

I'm having a lot of trouble reviewing this film. On one hand, I really like all the actors, and even their performances, but I don't think this film really worked on all the levels it attempted to. Greta Gerwig is one of the top up and coming actresses working today, and i actually thought Lola Kirke did well in her first starring role. But the narrative never grabbed me like Noah Baumbach's other film Frances Ha did, also with Gerwig.

But the film is also not at all bad, in fact this may very well be the case of myself just not understanding what was intended with the script. It was just hard to buy into the premise when nothing is really set up at all. The film just pretty much jumps into the plot of Tracy and Brooke spending time together as they get to know each other before officially becoming step-sisters. Their relationship was interesting, but I didn't find it to be profound or anything like that. The latter half of the film takes place mainly in one area with close to 10 characters and it seemed to be way too dramatic and theatrical for a low budget story on a few relatively regular human beings. 

It's unfortunate because the soundtrack and score are really quite good and seemed to fit for what they were going for at first, but the film just wasn't appealing enough for the score to really shine like it should have. I just feel like for a movie that is titled Mistress America, it should have been a more memorable outing. Sadly that's two Baumbach films this year that have been a bit of a letdown.

Saw this today after seeing many 5 star reviews in many publications and billboards here in London. To say I'm disappointed would be to employ gross understatement. 

The premise is interesting and creates big expectations from the outset (two young women - one has hit 30 and the other is a English Lit freshman at a NY university form an unlikely friendship when they are on the verge of becoming step-sisters when their respective divorced parent arrange to get married to each other).

This is the kind of screenplay Woody Allen could write in his sleep; but where Allen would exhaust the budding friendship of all its possibilities for humour, melancholy & therapy, Baumbach chooses instead to write an overly arch and self-conscious piece where all the characters seem to be on the same page in the same tribe with all involved being too cool and too smart for school; with all spouting dialogue that is too self-conscious for its own good. I would feel profoundly alienated in the company of these people in real life, where by contrast the characters in Wood Allen films always seem like friends I haven't met yet.

The whole story seems to be overy-worked, contrived, and reaching levels of shallowness I haven't witnessed for a long time. None of the characters are remotely warm or likable and by the end I didn't care what happened to Brooke or Tracy and their budding friendship.

Had Baumbach managed to get Wood Allen's involvement (as editor/collaborator) this could have been a highly humorous (I didn't laugh once and found a lot of the dialogue inaudible and localized for my understanding - Woody Allen never makes this mistake, his films are universal in their appeal even though they're set in the navel-gazing, therapy obsessed New York, there's a wonderful warmth and humour in his films which is just not present in 'Mistress America'.)

And as for the synth pop soundtrack it just seemed completely out of sync with the story and the main protagonists. I can't imagine either young female listening to synth pop composed in the 1980s - like OMD's 'Souvenir'. Play it once fine but repeat it later in the soundtrack sounds like 'clutching at straws' tactics to my ears.

On the plus side Greta Gerwhig clearly is a leading lady and I hope one day I see her again in a film that really showcases her talent. She reminds me of many other actresses like: Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow and would you believe Maria Sharapova? 

She's like a hybrid of all these women and yet has her own unique presence and look - not to mention having a passing resemblance to a younger Catherine Deneuve? Has a bright future in film but the crazy character she plays in Mistress America doesn't flatter her beauty or talent very much.

I'm a big Noah Baumbach fan. He is completely able to come up with clever, simple, original ideas and make a usually great movie out of them; but to my dismay, Baumbach's "Mistress America" is a bit of a miss.

The story was very nice, but the writing's cheap/obvious execution ruins it. There is a famous saying that originates from Anton Chekhov that is commonly used in film schools: "show don't tell." This picture breaks that simple saying in almost all of its lines, as characters will just randomly blurt out how they feel - all while keeping a neutral look on their face. 

Baumbach has also made a living out of his quick wit and intellectual humor, but unfortunately in "Mistress America," he decided to throw intellect out the window.

There are a few redeeming factors: its Woody Allen-esque use of camera-work, fitting choice of music, and easy to like characters. 

Though it doesn't live up to his previous films, "Mistress America" should be watched by Baumbach fans. If you don't like him, you won't like this; and if you haven't seen his other work, I recommend you watch that instead.

For those who saw Frances Ha, the film's overall writing style and pacing will not be a surprise. Saying that however, it doesn't overdo the "cleverness" in the same way Frances Ha did, and overall it kind of works better. Greta Gerwig has never been better. She really steals every second of her screen time and is really just such a marvel to watch. She infuses her own acting style to this in a different way, so it doesn't really feel like any of her other characters. The whole cast here is aces, and it leads to such a great work from the entire ensemble at Mimi Rose's house. I definitely recommend this. It's fast and it's a marvel to watch the characters say the dialogue in such a fun, quick way.

Over the years, I've liked some of Noah Baumbach's films, but not others, and this one I'm sorry to say was disappointing. Here, Baumbach directed and co-wrote the script with Greta Gerwig.

The underrated and most talented Gerwig also stars in the movie as Brooke, a free spirit who's leading a whirlwind of a life, with a myriad of part-time jobs but looking to close a deal on a new restaurant, in the Williamsburg section of NYC.

Lola Kirke co-stars here and gives a fine performance as Tracy, a first year college student at Barnard, aspiring to be a writer but having loads of problems fitting in on campus. Brooke and Tracy are slated to be step sisters when Brooke's father and Tracy's mother marry in the near future.

Thus, when Tracy, at the urging of her mother, calls Brooke and they meet for the first time in Manhattan, Tracy finds herself willingly caught up in the cyclone of Brooke's life. Tracy even finds herself using Brooke as inspiration for her short story that she submits to the prestigious Mobius Literary Society at her college.

All of this seems well and good, but for me the problem with the movie is in the dialogue, which often came across to me as mostly pretentious, whiny, and even mean-spirited at times. Thus, the characters that emerged were so shallow and self-absorbed that I mostly lost interest in what would happen to any of them. When that happens to me as I view a film, I start checking the time wondering when it will be finally over.

Overall, Gerwig and Kirke are solid here, with many actors in supporting roles adding much as well. However, as mentioned the occasional clever or humorous line was overshadowed by dialogue that came across to me as affected and pretentious, leading to surfacy and shallow characters.

The second collaboration between the director and Greta Gerwig. I just love their works, together they write awesome story and create a cinematic magic. Kind of rare filmmakers, only a very few from the past to compare these two to them. It was another quirky comedy, especially if you liked 'Frances Ha' you would like this as well. I hope they would come for the third time to complete 'An Untalented Girl from NYC' trilogy.

It was not as good as the previous film, but nothing short of awesome entertainment. I am surprised a few of those who liked that movie did not favour it. I knew it would be a chick comedy, accordingly, I was not expecting beyond that. But like all the time when I decide to watch a movie, I wanted it to be a better entertainer than the one I saw in the earlier. That's what everyone do, it was like the sea tides, the rise and fall is inevitable. Some would like it and some won't, but to me it was a very good.

Unlike 'Frances Ha', here there are two lead characters, both are young adult women, but the entire narration was from one person's perspective. That is, a college freshman Tracy. How her life follows, especially after meeting a girl who's soon-to-be her step-sister. As in a new place and socially inept, she finds her way to be joyous and adventurous, meets some new people and makes them friends. But how long this unplanned pleasure remains with her and what are all changes makes to her rest of the life is the remaining movie.

"I am so impressed by you and so worried for you at the same time."

It was a simple and soft narration, but engaging characters and well paced with a chain of fine comedies. Apart from writing and direction, the supporting cast was the best feature. It was a tiny twist at the end, but extremely essential to break the steady sequence to bring a diversion. Since that part, I have been wondering about the conclusion, but the makeover was really excellent, I think it was touching yet as I expected.

This is Lola Kirke's major role I've seen. She was fantastic and I hope to see her in more films in the lead. It was one of the best on- screen chemistry between her and Greta. There were many beautiful lines spoken between these two, very memorable and quotable ones. With all these top quality, if one still don't like, then he must be bored of watching plenty of similar themes. But that should not be a reason to trash it, because that is his personal issue to deal who's dumping on this one is totally unfair.

This movie was unique, fun, touching, heartbreaking, likable characters, filled with cheerful moments and overall one of the best recent films I have seen. It was more like a friendship movie on trust and commitment. The portrayal was at its best, an example of how a life can turn around in a matter of time. But how much more trustworthy is this sudden change and the best uses of it was the movie that told very nicely. I won't say it is a must see, but personally I feel that way.

This film tells the story of two young women who will become step sisters after their parents' marriage. They meet and bond quickly, and they go through life events in quick succession in the space of a few weeks.

"Mistress America" is a simple film that is dependent on dialogue and interesting characters. The quick pace and rapid fire dialogues remind me of Woody Allen films, and I think in here the dialogues are really good as they give the main characters distinct personalities. Brooke is very creative, bubbly, quirky but likable. Even the supporting characters are special, such as the jealous girlfriend and the rich woman who steals Brooke's ideas. There is so much going on in the film, even in the first ten minutes I thought I have already watched for much longer because so much has happened. I really enjoyed this charming film.

I thought this was a very good comedy, and very much in the spirit of Noah's other comedy oriented films; probably his funniest to date. Many funny lines. It carries insightful truths within it, but to me, reviewers who miss that this is a comedy, are missing the boat. But its a comedy that doesn't wait around for the viewer to catch up. In fact, I laughed more the second time I saw it because of the subtlety of the humor. The main characters have complexity, and the frosh college students actually act like college students. The central character, played beautifully by Greta Gerwig, captures a kind of person that very much exists in the world and is a very vibrant, paradoxical kind of person. She's a person you won't soon forget.

If someone were to represent Britain as a woman, no doubt she would be 50 years older than Greta Gerwig and constantly looking back to a long gone heyday, yet haunted by dark secrets from the past. 

But this is Mistress America, a comical personification of the American Dream, with some (but not too much) American reality thrown in. She chases the money, markets herself, engages in risky financial enterprises with bad follow through and finally reaps the inevitable lack of reward. In this, Baumbach seems to be suggesting America will have a similar fate, yet he is happy to watch the flame while it burns. The world is turning and Mavericks are dying out. Tracy (Lola Kirke) charts this demise with honesty and affection in the same way Baumbach is writing about America here.

It's in this allegorical approach the film shows most promise and offers more evidence of a change of style from Baumbach. But there is his safety zone, the middle class comedy of manners, the exuberant, wittily written dialogue. All very watchable, but what it amounts to in this love letter to America, it's hard to say. And Baumbach continues his habit of copping out at the end - neither Tracy nor Brooke really change, even when they apparently forgive each other. The last lines in the film are especially odd, I won't divulge them, but if you understand the angle of my review that Brooke is really America, you'll see what I mean.

However, I hope Baumbach continues his progression and hopefully returns to the excellence of Margot At The Wedding territory.

'MISTRESS America': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

Acclaimed indie filmmaker Noah Baumbach, reteams with actress Greta Gerwig (for the third time); to make this hilarious, but very sweet, quirky comedy flick! The film was directed by Baumbach, written by Baumbach and Gerwig, and it costars Gerwig and actress Lola Kirke (of 'MOZART IN THE JUNGLE' fame). The movie tells the story of a depressed college freshman, who finds new inspiration for life; when she meets her 'soon-to-be' stepsister. The film is classic Noah Baumbach; who's becoming one of my favorite filmmakers!

Tracy Fishko (Kirke) just started her freshman year, at Barnard College; and she's having trouble fitting in. She develops a crush on another student, named Tony (Matthew Shear); but he begins dating another girl instead, named Nicolette (Jasmine Cephas Jones). Tracy's mother (Kathryn Erbe) is about to be married, and she advises Tracy to meet her fiancé's daughter, Brooke (Gerwig). Brooke is full-of-life, and she inspires Tracy, in ways she's never experienced before. So Tracy writes a fictional short story, influenced by Brooke, and she begins spending a lot more time, with her 'soon-to-be stepsister' (as well).

The movie is brilliantly written, and beautifully directed! The characters are extremely likable, and quirky, and the dialogue is all very witty, and fun too (there's so many classic, quotable lines; all through the movie)! The film is also really inspiring, hilariously funny, and it has a great (nostalgic) 80s feel to it, as well. I absolutely love it, and Noah Baumbach!

This movie is no more than a couple smiles on your face.If you are looking for a movie about life , this one is for you . Although its labeled as a comedy , i would say that i've found more drama in it than comedy.Half an hour before the end the movie became a little depressing and a little boring for me .Also the cast job was not so good , i don't know why but i found it hard to believe the stuff the actors said , I'm not saying they are bad but they are not good either. The plot is OK , really if it was a little funnier and less depressing this movie could be a decent title , so far it deserves 6/10- from me and a wish i wouldn't have seen it.

Noah Baumbach's latest flick is a much needed improvement from his last disappointment, While We're Young. With Mistress America, Baumbach gets two things really right. First, the film is funny in the way that even straightest faces in the audience will crack by the end. Second, the film tells a story with painful accuracy. The greatest part, however, is that the quick 126 minute film runs like a play. The dialogue is quick, tight, and read with impeccable timing from the cast.

Mistress America is the story of Tracy's (Lola Kirke) unconventional first semester at Barnard College. Tracy's first few weeks at college are every freshman's nightmare. She struggles to make friends, good grades, and most importantly, into a prestigious literary writing group. Just as Tracy becomes into the loneliest sob story ever seen, she gets a call from Brooke (Greta Gerwig), the thirty-something daughter of the man Tracy's mom is about to marry. Tracy leaves her table for one and immediately finds herself enthralled in Brooke's world, soaking in every bit like she's never had friends or been to a party before. Brooke is the exact person one would expect to enter a boring protagonist's life. She is more than life itself, catching everyone's attention as she walks by. Brooke didn't need college apparently. She's an autodidact trying to start a restaurant in honor of her dead mother. Before the water works start, keep in mind that Brooke is ruthlessly selfish. Her dreams are as big as New York City, but she shows no sign of being scared of failing. The best scene is when a girl from Brooke's high school appears at the bar and stands up to Brooke after her years of torment. Brooke shows no remorse and hurls insults like she came out of her mother's womb criticizing saying the f-bomb. What a character, right? Tracy sure thinks so because she uses Brooke as her new subject to write on for her reapplication to the literary club. Tracy doesn't feel good about writing slanderous thoughts in her short story about Brooke, but she needs to prove herself as a college student who is just not doing "enough." Tracy earns the envy of the passively competitive and fellow literary reject, Tony. And while Tony may be all those things, he is the most accurate portrayal of a college student every seen in modern cinema. The story get heated when Brooke, Tracy, Tony, and Tony's girlfriend take a road trip to Connecticut to visit Brooke's old lover and best friend (now married) in order to ask them for money to invest into her restaurant. There could not be a more obvious set-up for drama. However, writers (and real-life couple) Gerwig and Baumbach keep the dialogue so accurate for a 2015 audience that the theater was practically shaking from laughter.

The film has heart at its core, but satire is its skin and bones. Brooke is a generational character. She floats from dream to dream without ever following through with one of her brilliant ideas. Not convinced of the satire yet? Brooke claims she is inflicted with an "unnamed illness" that causes her to lay in bed and watch television all day. The only real debate in this statement is whether or not the dig is directed towards the recent trend in categorizing everything that is not 100 percent happiness as an "illness" or that no one leaves their bed on the weekends anymore because, Netflix. However, Gerwig brings the other half of a satirical character besides the truth humor. She is simply hilarious. She delivers her lines like the expert she is, and when the camera is just on her face, she commands it. Her presence is absolute dynamite. However, she does make room for newcomer Lola Kirke. Kirke's character is the other half of millennialslonely, entitled, and unapologetic for her actions.

While Baumbach's direction is masterful, the editing felt awkward and choppy at times. However, the editing was really the only flaw in the near-perfect movie. Mistress America is the film that America needs.

A refreshing, if not entirely successful, change of pace for Noah Baumbach. Leaving behind the upper-crust east coast neurotics that pepper his other movies and make them sometimes intolerable, he focuses instead on the relationship between a young woman (Lola Kirke) and her soon-to-be sister-in-law (Greta Gerwig), a freewheeling spirit who the young girl takes on as a life mentor. 

"Mistress of America" feels very honest in its exploration of the thorniness that comes with admiration. Kirke looks to Gerwig as a kind of role model, but she also begins to realize that those we emulate are not infallible, and what we sometimes learn from them is how not to be. This lesson comes to Kirke at the expense of her relationship with Gerwig, and they have the predictable falling out, but the movie ends in a place that feels right. Just because we acknowledge that role models aren't perfect doesn't mean they can't still be role models.

Baumbach shoots for a zany screwball tone in "Mistress America" that doesn't really fit his talents. The strain is most noticeable in an extended scene set in the vast home of one of Gerwig's friends. I wanted to think it was funny, but mostly it just felt forced. But I'll take Baumbach's attempts at comedy, even if uneven, over the unbearable whiners in, say, "Margot at the Wedding," any day.

Lola Kirke stars as a college freshman in NYC who feels, as many an 18 year-old, superior to all other people her age, and thus very lonely. Her mother suggests that she get to know her soon-to-be step-sister (Greta Gerwig), who also lives in the city. About 30 (though always claiming to be in her 20s), Gerwig immediately comes across to the audience as a huge phony - but to an 18 year-old, she seems like a wise, worldly woman and Kirke latches onto her immediately. As a film about a couple of phonies, yeah, the targets sometimes seem too easy here. However, both Kirke and Gerwig are so likable that it's easy to see past their terribleness. Deep down, they are flawed people, and you want them to overcome those flaws. It also helps that Gerwig is absolutely hilarious. This isn't nearly the classic that her last collaboration with Baumbach was (like Frances Ha, she co-wrote the film), but it's good and a heck of a lot better than Baumbach's last film, While We're Young.

It may seem odd, but I did like the actors, just not their parts. Most of them seemed miscast. But I did like them, and I wish them well. The director, I think, brought in too much swishing, swooshing movement and there was too much pseudo-sophisticated hyper-talk, which made the actors all seem amateurish. The story-line was so subtle, I never did get it, unless it was about lost,lonely souls living in New York, where everyone seems lost and lonely anyway. The characters were implausible (does anyone act like that in real life?). NONE of it seemed like real life. This truly did seem like a high school stage play with kids trying to put on a 'sophisticated' production. I actually wanted to get up and leave after about 20 minutes, but my spouse wouldn't let me because we'd already paid for it. The one thing that seemed true about it was that I really did feel everyone's pain. And that was due to the acting.

This was made by the man who gave us Frances Ha the previous time so on that count I was intrigued and watched eagerly. That one was fresh, vibrant, it captured uncertain life on the crossroads. It felt like American New Wave.

This is a bit less, still in the same vein, about youth caught in between stations in life in the big city, a freshman (freshwoman?) in college and as counterpart a woman bracing for 30. They're both in New York, both looking for what the next step ought to be. 

The young girl is smitten by the other's brash spontaneity, by her ability to throw herself into things and just stir up life as she goes. But we also note that she's self-absorbed, not someone who listens to others or someone who is really mindful of herself or what happens around her. She waves things off but we note this as closeness instead of wakefulness.

The young girl is turning all this into a story, the story as the film itself; when her friend reads it, she is irate, feeling betrayed but in another sense denying to see herself from the outside. The movie has moved to a spacious house in Connecticut at that point, going for screwball milling around a stage. At that point I was wishing for the free wandering of Frances.

Overall it strikes some of the same sensitivity of portrayal as Frances, some of the same endearment in faces and transient life. It is a bit too cute this time, but within a container of wanting to find out about people in all this modern flux.

The parting notion I find poignant. Neither marriage that would have cemented their bond, creating a Thanksgiving gathering each year, nor restaurant dream as hope for a beautiful next life pan out. Which is to say, the journey continues as it always does, she will be on a plane to LA, maybe it will be marvelous, maybe not. It's a film about courage and I'll always urge you to have these films in your life.

If a theme seems to be emerging out of Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach's collaborations it's that women's friendships are complex, loving and real. Their first collaboration together, Frances Ha, left me cold, but I was completely and utterly charmed by their second, Mistress America. 

Lola Kirke plays Tracy, an undergrad who is finding it difficult to fit in at university where everyone always seems one step ahead of her. Desperately alone she hesitantly contacts her soon to be step-sister, Brooke, whom she's never met before on her mother's suggestion. Almost immediately she falls for Brooke. Not in a romantic way, but to her Brooke seems the perfect embodiment of everything she wants to be. Wild, passionate, daring, exciting, warm and welcoming. Tracy spends her days being dazzled by Brooke and starts to write a short story about her that she calls Mistress America. Of course Brooke isn't the perfect person she imagines and as the movie goes on the limits of their friendship are uncomfortably tested. 

I do not particularly like Gerwig as an actress, but she works best here because she's more of a secondary character. Brooke is seen mostly through Tracy's loving eyes but we can see that she's slightly ridiculous and not all she's cracked up to be. Lola Kirke is fantastic as Tracy. The script is slightly uneven but everyone offers just enough crackling energy to make it really work. 

A delight of a film.

This is a movie in which just starting the film, only with the presentation of their characters, I am already saturated with them. The two protagonists saturate me. I do not get any kind of affinity with them. They seem simple to me, empty and to top it all I do not see that they pursue anything.

It's a movie in which the minutes pass and I can only think, but where is this going? I can not make sense of anything. Everything is happy, happy and we arrived at the end of the movie.

To top it all I seem to be watching a TV movie on a Sunday at three thirty To top it off I do not like any technical section except the costumes. It really leaves me so cold that I can not think of more to say about it.

Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig are at it again, "it" being what it means to be a 20- something in New York City. In "Mistress America," however, the lens and perspective shifts away from the character you'd expect a movie like to this to intimately follow (Gerwig's interesting, ambitious, never-boring Brooke) and instead observes her from an outsider's perspective (Tracy, played by Lola Kirke).

Tracy is instead the main character, a Barnard freshman studying literature and writing, trying to make her way through that formidable (and familiar) landscape. Inspiration strikes, however, when she meets Brooke, her future step-sister. Brooke is around 30, and she's been through the grinder both personally and professionally. She is an innovator who always has big ideas, and Tracy uses her life as the basis of a short story that she hopes will get her into the school's prestigious lit magazine. 

Things get particularly interesting when Brooke finds herself locked out of her apartment one day and learns that her boyfriend has pulled all his financial support out of a restaurant they were just about to open together and she seeks a psychic for advice on where to turn next.

Through this blossoming relationship between Tracy and Brooke we observe the typical indie film "portrait of a Millennial" in a way that both mythologizes it (evidenced by Tracy's story/perception of Brooke) and makes it hit home. Brooke is quirky and her life is a melodrama, but it also feels very real. Baumbach and Gerwig's previous collaboration, "Frances Ha," also struck this seemingly contradictory chord of authenticity and whimsy. When there is a dissonance, it's softened by the knowledge that there's such emotional truth at the core of what they're doing.

Another way of putting it is that Baumbach and Gerwig aren't so interested in plot points and what happens. At less than 90 minutes, this movie about a relationship between a younger and older 20-something is not trying to show you something you've never seen before. What they do care about is the trajectory of the relationships between characters. It's hard not to see a piece of yourself in the characters, especially if you're of a similar age, and that holds our attention enough that "Mistress America" doesn't fall apart, even when it's not especially compelling.

"Mistress America" also tends to be be philosophical and angsty. The level of intellectual conversation is to a degree that rarely happens in real life, let alone in these perfect scene-length snippets, but again, like other parts of the film that gravitate closer to being over-the-top, the creative choice to lean that way comes from a strong and earnest desire to explore very relevant themes and ideas.

Frankly, Baumbach and Gerwig could tell a hundred different stories about coming of age in your 20s or 30s in a big city and I'd watch (especially at such a reasonable runtime). But even if you don't think you could, the effort they make to explore a unique "relationship" between two women in "Mistress America" and cast light on this familiar film from a new angle makes this particularly story worthwhile.

Thoroughly enjoyed this slice-of-life, coming-of-age, comedy/drama. The dialogue is so well written that you feel as though you are eavesdropping on the would-be sisters. The opposite personalities of the characters works so well to illustrate 2 different ways to approach life, the younger woman proceeding with caution, the older without fear. Both actresses, Greta Gerwig and Lola Kirke embody their characters with a naturalness that is rare. The fringe characters were well developed too. They were essential as glue to hold the storyline together. The males in the film were real people, not what Hollywood writers think men are supposed to be. If you enjoy Woody Allen-like fast paced, intelligent dialogue, then this is a must see.

1. Writing/Acting? I think the writing really good and should keep you engaged. I don't know other Noak Baumbach's works but his fans seem disappointed with this one. Greta Gerwig character reminded me of Alicia Silverstone in "Clueless" and Lola Kirke is just adorable. Both leads were great as well as supporting cast. The writing combined with the acting made it enjoyable similar to movies rated 6.7 or 6.8 in IMDb. 

2. Did it make me laugh? Just a little but I watched this alone. Greta Gerwig character gives you the most attempts to laugh.

3. Unnecessary, unrealistic components? Scenes from old boyfriends house was a bit silly and unnatural but not over the top. The good writing keeps it in control. You find no special effects of gimmicks.

4. Soundtrack? Subconsciously, I might be giving the movie higher ratings because the music put me in the right place. Subtle background songs that seem to have "The Cure" influenced in several scenes. There were other 80's tunes made it flow for me.

Mistress America is supposedly a quirky homage to screwball comedies from director Noah Baumbach. I think he should had taken advise from Peter Bogdanovich as to how to make modern screwball comedies.

Tracy (Lola Kirke) is a misfit college freshman at a small university in New York where she is a little lonely and lost. She starts to hang out with her 30 year old step sister to be the malevolent Brooke (Greta Gerwig). Brooke's father is due to marry Tracy's mother.

Tracy at first becomes captivated by Brooke's creativity, worldliness and carefree lifestyle. Brooke is angry that her previous creative ideas have been stolen and desires to open a restaurant but requires investors when her Greek boyfriend bales out. As explored in Baumbach's previous film 'When we're Young' the younger Tracy soon leeches from the older Brooke as she pilfers elements of Brooke's life for a short story.

The film feels to much like a stage play, they literally do stand around as if they were on stage. They even deliver lines like the audience were in the same auditorium. The more people and talk over each other the film comes across as dull.

If they did not mention things like Twitter and Google, I could swear the film was set in the 1980s as the soundtrack consists of 1980s mainly British synth music. Songs by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark turn up a few times.

The film is in a minor key. It weaves from being smart and sassy to being just dull. At the end the younger Tracy realises that the older Brooke is destined for failure as she cannot follow up on her creativity. Tracy feels smug about it.
