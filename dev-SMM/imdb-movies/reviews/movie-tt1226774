### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Is it a work of fictional farce or an insightful view of the members of the governmental bureaucracy? Probably in truth, In The Loop is a little bit of both, but more so its a whole lot of fun at the governments expense. There have been numerous films over the years giving us insight into how our government works, at times it sure looks bleak and unjust, but we sure haven't seen it in such a ridiculous view. In The Loop aims at making sure they scrutinize the bureaucratic desk jocks for all their worth. The film follows the Minister of International Development (Tom Hollander) after he has put his foot in his mouth, unintentionally announcing that war is unforeseeable. Back tracking and word-smith manipulations prove mute, fortunately for the Minister he's got big fans in the US who would like nothing more then to use the naive Brit in their political posturing. The hawks begin circling and before the Minister knows what game he's playing he's into deep and merely a puppet in the political theater.

There is a hint of a serious political thriller in the plot here, but In The Loop knows we've seen all that before so why not have a little fun, actually why not have a whole lot of fun and throw in lots of scalding four letter words and absolute British wit. Tom Hollander as the Minister of I.D. is dumb-foundingly perfect in his role and is well complemented by his bungling assistant Oliver (played exceptionally by Chris Addison). As the Director of Communications, Peter Capaldi steals the show with his relentlessly scathing superhuman vulgarity ridden wit. Those with a distaste for such colorful language should look elsewhere as their ears will certainly be on fire if they can last through a third of the film. Personally the language was not a problem for me, I appreciate a master of the finer words, and Capaldi has shown himself to deliver his lines with such craftsmanship that sailors around the world will be put to shame.

The Brits are a fantastic mess, but of course what international mess would be complete without the United States Govt.. And so comes the behemoth know as James Gandolifini, the Don Capo hasn't lost any of his on-screen presence. As the ol' war vet Pentagon General, Gandolfini is gruff and verbally abusive in a really mean spirited way, which is glorious. Those with a keen sense of cinema will notice how well the film shifts humor as the Brits come across the pond to the the dry humor of America. Gandolfini makes the most of his screen time, but on the American side the majority of the ridiculousness comes from Mimi Kennedy, as the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy and her bickering 20 something Capital Hill brown nosing assistants. Director Armando Ianucci's delivers such a cynical sharp witted look at all things politically ridiculous and it works on so many levels. Fans of British humor will love this, its pureness to the form is perfectly meshed into the political platform that moves the comedy along with merely a few small bumps in the road. On the other side of the coin, those who enjoy making fun of those of the diplomatic persuasion will delight in the roasting of our governmental members.

One of the best political satirical comedies in years! 'In The Loop' is a spin-off (kind-of) of the fantastic British comedy 'The Thick of It', and follows Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), a Cabinet Minister who makes a series of unfortunate slip-ups, the first is when he tells an interviewer that he believes war (always referred to as the invasion or the war, but never Iraq or potentially Afghanistan) is "unforeseeable" before telling journalists under pressure that you have to conquer a mountain of conflict on the path of peace. These mistakes place him in the middle of a diplomatic mine-field as both, the anti-war constabulary led by General Miller (James Gandolfini) and the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), and the gung-ho supporter of war Linton Barwick (David Rasche) - so crazy he keeps a live grenade as a paperweight - want Simon as a transatlantic partner to support their cause. Should he put his conscience or his political career first? Oh, and throw in hilariously vicious Senior British Press Office Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) and a bumbling Adviser to the minster (Toby played by Chris Addison) and you have one of the best political satires to come from Britain in years.

What makes the film work so well is the incredibly sharp witty script from a collaboration of writers that keeps the gag-per-minute counter ticking. Every meeting, confrontation political mishap is cradled with joke after joke whether they are subtle references to the cynicism and underhandedness in the current (or foregone) political climate or simply one of Malcolm Tucker's fantastic rants  "I'm going to tear out your shinbone, split it in two and stab you to f**king death with it" - at ineptitude of everybody around him. Every actor and actress involved give solid performances as the flawed members of the tense political world. While Simon's central story keeps the film on the ground despite a few diplomatic detours (that are still hilarious, even though they take up little of the running of time).

Armando Iannucci has already proved to the British public that he can create entertainment for the TV-masses and 'In The Loop' proves he also has the skills to replicate this on a wider, international, big-screen scale as well. It's intelligent, it's offensive, and it's bleeding funny. See this film!

In the Loop is an unusually good and funny film from a usually tepid and rather unfunny genre. After enduring an onslaught of mediocre films centered around the war in Iraq, 2009 seems to have finally brought audiences closer to cinematic resolution: first Kathryn Bigelow's invigorating The Hurt Locker gave us a fresh insight, and now this: a relatively lighter affair, to be sure, but one of such rapid-fire wit that a second viewing is almost required.

In stereotypically British fashion, the humour is dry  you probably won't experience many belly laughs  and yet selling it merely as such seems like something of a disservice to its quality. Best described in one line as a blend of Dr. Strangelove, This Is Spinal Tap and the Ricky Gervais Office series, director Armando Iannucci has parodied the lunacy of political disinformation and thoughtless rhetoric without his film coming across as a laborious broken record or the mouthpiece of an insufferable pacifist. No, you don't have to be a liberal to enjoy this (although I can't necessarily picture Bill O'Reilly endorsing it)  anyone with an appreciation for intelligent comedy, regardless of personal views, should find something to admire here, and it'll be a shame if the picture isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay by year's end.

The film is a spin-off of Iannucci's UK show The Thick of It, starring a couple of the same characters, and it presumably takes place during the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq (although, to be fair, we're never given the precise name of the country being targeted, nor the date for which these events take place).

The plot moves fast and some of the characters are hard to get a handle on at first, but it goes something like this: Britain's Minister of International Development, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), has a slip of the tongue while recording a live radio interview, admitting that any instance of war is "unforeseeable" and thereby perhaps even necessary  thus enraging the Prime Minister's Director of Communications, Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi in a scathingly brilliant performance). At the behest of the PM, Tucker has Foster and his new assistant, Toby (Chris Addison), shipped off to Washington, D.C., where they suffer a game of political discourse with a pro-war State Department official (played well by David Rasche). The film also features talented actors in minor roles: James Gandolfini appears in one of the film's most unexpectedly funny scenes, as a four-star general who computes the cost of a hypothetical war using a kids' toy calculator. ("At the end of a war, you need some soldiers left, really, or else it looks like you've lost.") Steve Coogan, whose wonderful Alan Partridge was co-created by Iannucci, pops up in one of the more silly-minded sequences, as a man with a bit of a wall issue.

Though the film has achieved almost unanimous praise amongst critics, there have been some complaints, namely those of the NY Press' Armond White. Usually I don't address the comments of other reviewers, mainly because I typically don't care, but also because everyone is entitled to their own opinion; yet I felt compelled to respond to White's assertion that "Iannucci's sense of place is indistinguishable from The Office or The West Wing." The Office, sure, but The West Wing? Really? Did we watch the same film, Mr. White? That show's relative glamorization of closed door politics could not be at more complete odds with In the Loop, both in style and substance. What's particularly interesting is that UK magazine Time Out did an article on the film last year, and even cited the movie's production design as being the polar opposite of The West Wing's. Journalist Dave Calhoun wrote: "Iannucci tells me that he sees In the Loop as a cousin of The Thick of It. The similarities are everywhere, down to the docu-style, hand-held camera-work evident on the monitors (it's the same director of photography) and the anti-'West Wing' production design that throws all notions of political glamour out the window." I mention this only because it is worth pointing out the movie's heavy cynicism. Screen International's David D'Arcy noted the film's untimely release: "Its exuberant, boundless cynicism will test the demand for political satire in an Obama-infatuated America." I respectfully disagree  audiences have never shown an inclination towards noting their countries' present failures, which would perhaps best explain why almost every single motion picture focused on the Iraq War since 2003 has been a box office flop. Audiences flock to cinemas for escapism  not reminders. If time heals all wounds, then perhaps this is the opportune time to release In the Loop: at a point when we can begin to take a step back and accept the humour.

Regardless: this is a very sharp, decisive comedy, and certainly worth seeking out. The "instant classic" label is vastly overused, but it is perhaps not unforeseeable that this film may one day be for politics what Spinal Tap was for heavy metal.

In other words: an instant classic.

Political comedy is a hard stunt to pull off. Ever since 1964, it seemed like nothing could top Dr. Strangelove. A lot of movies have tried and a lot have failed, although there were the lucky few that passed the bar (Election, Thank You for Smoking) but the brilliant thing about In The Loop is that it's so stupidly funny that it's one of the best comedies of the 21st Century! Armando Iannucci, most known for his The Thick of It series in the UK, directs a movie with the a the familiar theme of The Office. That documentary-style of film-making can be hit-or-miss (most recently, Public Enemies, a miss) and Iannucci hits it right on. Every scene he graces with a camera comes out picture perfect; nobody could've pegged this movie any better. Iannucci, Jesse Armstrong, Tony Roche and Simon Blackwell's script is something out of picture show heaven and sounds like it must've taken forever to finish, edit, revise, etc. Although these guys, these geniuses, apparently know what they're doing and don't care what anybody else says. That is the heart and soul of movie-making, readers. In The Loop is about a corrupt British government that accidentally gets the country thrown into the middle of a war. Loop stars Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee, James Gandolfini, Chris Addison and there's even a whimsical cameo by Steve Coogan. Capaldi is the absolute best at what he did, spewing swears as coarse as they are a riot ("fuck you, you lubricated horse cock!") and freaking out. I can't even put into words just how funny this guy was; he made the movie! But don't forget Addison as Toby. Addison is the British Napoleon Dynamite, that incredibly awkward guy that makes even the audience members turn red. James Gandolfini and Gina McKee round out the rest of the cast greatly, filling In The Loop with the type of sexual tension that you don't want to think about. It's like when a sex scene pops up on a DVD you're watching with your parents. Yeah, that bad.In The Loop is one of the most laugh out loud comedies I've seen in the past decade, that sadly nobody will get a chance to watch. In a world of Transformers and G.I Joe, In The Loop will sadly be ignored. But on an optimistic note, we may have found this summer's sleeper, America.

5/5 stars.

There is something about British comedy that resonates with me. I don't know if it is because we in the States experience so little of it, or maybe because Hollywood rapes and pillages the material for their own water-downed versions, but the humor just seems fresh, uncensored, and hilarious. When I first came across the new political black comedy In the Loop, I will admit to being less than interested. The marketing materials were using the whole Obama silkscreen poster look and I really wasn't interested in a movie about how the US and Britain decided to go into the Middle East. But then the buzz started. The realization that the film was shot with a penchant for improv, a desire to entertain rather than teach, and a cast of characters looking as though they are in a Christopher Guest movie, soon turned that preconception around. This is a fantastic film that never lets up on the laughs or one-liners. I just hope people go into it knowing that this isn't how it actually happened  but then who knows? Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.

The back and forth dialogue is so quick that I couldn't believe my eyes when I read a quote from the director about it all being about 80-85% scripted. He says that he gave the actors leeway to break course and even do takes without scripts at all, but when culling everything together, most of what stuck actually maintained the verbiage laid out by its five screenwriters. Each of these men, including director Armando Iannucci, has been working with British television and all have collaborated on the show "The Thick of It". I will say now, if I get a chance to check it out, I most certainly will. Political satire is not necessarily my favorite thing in the worldI'll watch the odd "Daily Show" episodebut after viewing this laugh-riot, checking out a spoof on the British political system, of which I know very little, could be a ton of fun. Heck, just the inclusion of Peter Capaldi will get me to stop surfing when I reach the BBC. This guy steals the show without question.

Capaldi plays Malcolm Turner, a Brit on the frontline of politics as an aide to the Prime Minister, spinning everything and anything to save face. With no time to spare on his running across the Atlantic to put out fires wherever his compatriots start them, you will have to forgive his abrasive, sarcastic, and just plain mean demeanor. The idea of war is being bandied about on talk shows, behind closed-door governmental meetings, and all over the media machine, and it is up to him to keep a lid on it by walking the party line, neither stating a fight is inevitable or unforeseeabletwo terms that the buffoon who is British Secretary of State for International Development Simon Foster, played beautifully by the ever capable Tom Hollander, loves to utter. Foster just has to open his mouth to cause a stir felt around the world, and each time, of course, Malcolm Turner is there to chastise and humiliate his stupidity.

The film ultimately revolves around the journey Hollander's Foster takes in trying to enhance exposure for himself. Partaking in talk shows or talking out of turn when enlisted to just be "room meat", some of the Americans begin to see him as someone abroad that shares their sentiment that war is a bad idea. While David Rasche's Linton Barwicka hardcore proponent of battle, even using a live grenade as a paperweightforms secret committees to discuss strategies for war, Mimi Kennedy's Karen Clarke and James Gandolfini's Lt. General George Miller are looking for ways to get into that meeting and shut it down. As a result, those two dissenters try to get Foster at every event to awkwardly express his stance of war being unforeseeable, hoping to deter any people on the fence that may be in attendance. So, Malcolm must run back and forth through England and DC spinning things his way and lambasting anyone that gets in his line of fire. Either Foster is too oblivious to care about the verbal assaults thrown his way or he just feels he can blame his Director of Communications Judy, who he makes stay at home while he globe-trots with his new young adviser Toby, (Gina McKee and Chris Addison respectively). Toby and Foster are so similar in their awe of America and lack of experience that their adventures make for good cinema, taking camera phone pics out their limo and speaking about getting hookers for the ride.

In the Loop is expertly acted and, for the most part, I have to credit that to the intelligent script being utilized. Whether the actors are improvising or not, the original text they are sticking to or springboarding from needed to be strong. By using all the jokes and imbecilic actions we associate with politicians, the writers have crafted a plausible, if not entirely idiotic, account of the days leading up to our countries' joint invasion. Documents are leaked, words are twisted, and supposed partners are stabbed in the back. But through it all we have Capaldi doing his best to keep Britain's stance as noncommittal as possible. And, truthfully, the way in which he does it makes for what has to be the funniest role of the year. Every word out of his mouth is acerbic and full of double meaning. With the f-word spewing at will and demeaning name-callings going left and right, make sure your head is clear if British speech sometimes troubles you in the comprehension realm. Understanding his words definitely pays off, keeping what would otherwise be a slightly bloated and meandering plot grounded in comedic excellence.

The Big Questions: Can an adult comedy (i.e one without masturbation, anal sex, and talking genitals) attract people during the summer season? Can director Armando Iannucci, known for BBC series "The Thick of It", adapt the series to the screen in "In the Loop"? Does this war-room satire bring anything new to war-room satires? 

Tom Hollander (the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies) plays British Secretary of State Simon Foster, who in a radio interview says that war with the Middle East is "unforeseeable." The statement is enough to send the Prime Minister's chief adviser Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) into hysterics. The US President and UK Prime Minister are keen on a war and Tucker wants to give it to them. In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Karen Clarke (Mimi Kennedy) has learned of a secret War Committee formed by Linton Barwick (David Rasche) and she dispatches her secretary, Liza (Anna Chlumsky, yup, from 1991's "My Girl"), to find out everything she can about it. Clarke and General Miller (James Gandolfini) are against the war and are willing to do anything in their power to stop it, even inviting Simon and his assistant Toby (Chris Addison) to Washington thinking that Simon might be usable. Just Simon is a clueless pawn without the slightest idea what he's doing. Other story strands center around an anti-war paper written by Liza, and an affair she has with Toby.

The foolishness of government war-mongering is sent-up well by this profane and viciously over the top comedy. If you've read the several books about the events leading up to the Iraq War, the constant and disconcerting string of manipulation, deception, back-door tactics, and posturing for political career gain, as well as how they all think of it as a game without consequences, incorporated by these underlings won't shock you too much, but the laughs just might. Shot with a hand-held camera that brings to mind "The Office", these people run around like chickens with their heads chopped off (some of which is very hard to even keep track of) trying to win out over the other side. The fast pacing, profanely clever dialogue, and flying insults are relentless. There are references to CNN being the Cartoon News Network, kids just out of college making big White House decisions, a sexual encounter for world peace, and a funny attack on a fax machine. In addition to turning profanity into a bodily function, characters (usually) shout pop culture references (John and Yoko, Kid from Eraserhead), and various other more derogatory names at each other. It's a tad excessive at times, but funny.

Peter Capaldi is the key stand-out in the cast, being the most over-the-top of them all. His obscene and excessively profane performance as the Prime Minister's lead guy is tremendously entertaining as he continues to verbally lay-out anyone he doesn't like or that gets in his way with ridiculously clever barbs. Hollander does well with the role of the cluelessly spineless Simon Foster. James Gandolfini and Mimi Kennedy each give strong performances, and Chris Addison, Anna Chlumsky (its good to see her back by the way), and the rest of the cast do nice work as well. Also look for Steve Coogan in a funny cameo as a "fogged off" Brit complaining about a wall.

The Verdict: While excessive and hard to follow at times, Iannucci, and his three other writers, create an adult satire that, while may not be for everybody, is pretty funny.

Fast paced blend of close-to-truth political intrigue, satire, clever banter and intensity, with enough simplified and goofy humor to keep American audiences shrieking with laughter. The LA festival audience was blessedly quiet through the more subtle and deeply clever humor, so if you have a pan-Atlantic sensibility you can laugh at the cleverly done but obvious stuff, as well as the richer humor that requires attention.

The cast - American, English and Scottish all did an amazing job with high synergy.

There is quite a lot of both obvious and subtle political and cultural allegory, homages, and oblique references.

It was great to see it in a packed theater, and get that immersive social experience one does not get with a DVD.

Greetings again from the darkness. A spin-off of the British series The Thick of it, this film comes across as an odd mixture of Dr Strangelove, Spinal Tap, The Office ... think Christopher Guest remakes The West Wing. There are some incredibly funny lines and therein lies the films only problem.

What prevents the film from being truly great is that the comedy lines are so well written (and acted) that the story itself is shoved aside. Kind of a shame because I love the basis for the story. Combining the politics of both the U.S. and England and weaving their process and decision making into one film ... and then backdropping the decision on whether to go to war, is ingenious and fascinating. But as I said, the story takes a real backseat and many viewers will pay scant attention to the entire war theme. Watching politicians negotiate for power and struggle with quotable (yet meaningless) phrases is a hoot. And the posturing is not limited to the power brokers, as we see their assistants are playing the same game ... just with less at stake.

Ultimately the film works as an aggressive, loud, foul mouthed quote fest and not so much as the political editorial it could/should have been. Peter Capaldi dominates the film as the spin doctor who uses intimidation to mask his schemes. Tom Hollander would have been the soul of the film, if it were better developed as a story. All will recognize him from Pirates of Caribbean. James Gandolfini, Mimi Kennedy, David Rasche and James Gandolfini provide the U.S. contingency that are deflatingly realistic and make us so "proud". Don't miss a funny turn by the great Steve Coogan as the poor citizen who just wants his mum's retaining wall repaired so it doesn't crush her in the greenhouse. While certainly not woven seamlessly into the film, it does provide a shot of realism for what Hollander's character would face.

Lastly, it is very nice to see Anna Chlumsky back on screen. An immediate child star in My Girl ... remember her kiss with Maculey Culkin? Ms. Chlumsky is now a mature presence and should definitely be a consistent actress for years to come.

Armando Iannucci's brilliant political satire, 'The Thick Of It', takes obvious cues from real events (and personalities) in British politics; and cooks these ingredients into a splendidly toxic broth personified by the character of Maclolm Tucker, spin doctor extraordinaire, the man with the most inventive foulmouth on the planet. The other protagonists are slimy, incompetent, self-serving; but part of Iannucci's genius is that even as you hate them, you almost end up feeling sorry for them as well, doomed to play their part in the political machine. It's a brilliant programme; what's even more unusual is the success of its adaptation to the big screen. To make 'In the Loop', Iannucci has directly addressed one of the biggest recent political stories, the second Gulf War, which also allows him to introduce a range of American archetypes into his drama; as with his British characters, the mixture of exaggeration, subtlety and sheer venality in their portrayals is wonderfully judged. And although wholly fictional, as an account of how certain intelligence dossiers came to be faked, it's also wholly compelling and believable. Less surprisingly, many of the regular cast from the TV series also feature in the film, although (Peter Capaldi as Tucker aside) in slightly different roles. But there's no denying the basic quality of the humour here; the title of this review, incidentally, is one character's description of opera. A film which makes you laugh or think as much is rare; one which does both is something special indeed.

This is not a movie for those looking for the cosy delusional homilies and self congratulatory tributes to politicians of something like Yes Minister, it's vulgar, raw, enticing. An excellent comedy that never lets a moment pass without something to amuse, whilst being painfully poignant at the same time. In the build up to war, the UK government conspires to provide made up intelligence to the US to justify an act of war... sound familiar? Really, really, really funny and those who claim Yes Minister and it's ilk are superior, or more representative of what goes on in the 'corridors of power', aren't living in the real world. Critics who compare this to 'The Thick of It': remember, if this movie includes the same characters it's obviously set before the events of 'in the loop', hence we might expect them to be more energetic, rawer and ... well swear a lot. I'm not sure the pacing of TToI would have worked in movie form and it's nice to see that the writers were able to translate the basic idea to a successful movie, unlike so many TV adaptations which have fallen flat on their faces.

IN THE LOOP is a thunder-paced, dialog-driven British comedy with corruption more insidious than SYRIANA and dialogue more fierce than PULP FICTION.

Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) is a small-thinking, mealy-mouthed, indecisive, powerless British politician (i.e. your average politician, British or otherwise), craving to be taken seriously in the worst way. After a war conference between British and American movers and shakers which he is "allowed" to attend as "a piece of meat" (to his chagrin), he is accosted by reporters and sees his chance to prove he is In The Loop with the big boys.

On the spot, stuttering like a motorboat, Foster blurts a statement, "To walk the road of peace, we must be prepared to climb the mountain of conflict," seemingly advocating Allied war with the Middle East. But the war council (euphemistically named the Future Planning Committee) spins a contrary stance; Foster's statement goes from damage control to viral to bumper sticker in a matter of hours. And he suddenly finds himself being taken seriously. In the worst way.

From trying to get his feet wet, to trying to keep his head above water...

Foster is the foot-in-mouth device that sets IN THE LOOP in motion, but the movie belongs to one man amongst this unquestionably stellar cast: Peter Capaldi as British Director of Communications Malcolm Tucker. With his guttural denunciations and his blackly humorous manner of direct confrontation, Capaldi propels this movie like a saw-toothed shark, all in his proximity quailing before his grievous-bodily-harm loquacious embrace: "This is a government department, not some f**king Jane f**king Austen novel! Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up your shitter with a lubricated horse c*ck!" Capaldi makes IN THE LOOP the SEXY BEAST of political farces.

And everyone rises to the occasion to keep up. With four writers credited to the screenplay (Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and director Armando Iannucci), dialogue is more syrupy vicious than Tarantino's wet dreams. It's almost distracting. I could listen to these guys creatively insult each other all day, screw the plot.

The lovely Gina McKee is Tucker's executive assistant; David Rasche is an American politician, playing it like an evil Ed Begley Jr.; rosy-cheeked young Chris Addison is the fresh-faced new junior assistant to Foster, who tells him at one point that the situation will be "easy-peasy lemon-squeezy" to which Foster replies it will instead be "difficult-difficult lemon-difficult" and then gets caught having to explain what he means to the whole war council...

When Foster flees the limelight back to his local council, where he must listen to old ladies complain about septic tanks and concerned citizen Steve Coogan complain about a council wall falling into his mother's backyard, he realizes being a flustered meat puppet wasn't half bad after all, and returns to the abrasive pounce of Tucker.

Only one man can stand down Tucker's acid tongue--Tony Soprano! As a Senior Military Assistant--James Gandolfini, who realizes that only those who have not experienced war crave it so glibly, and whose bearlike presence and quiet, overbearing certitude swiftly puts Tucker in his place. "You're his little English b*tch and you don't even know it. Bet if I came to your hotel room tonight, I'd find you down on all fours, him hanging out the back of you." Bada-bing!

There are no explosions, car chases or murders--these people are much worse; explosive, unchaste and backbiting, their covert, duplicitous war decisions apt to cost many more lives than simple explosions, car chases or murders. And the whole cast is shot through with an ambiguous badness that just reeks of life on the beltway.

If you like your comedy intelligent, witty and frighteningly rude, IN THE LOOP is your bacchanal.

One of the wittiest and most sophisticated movie satires of recent vintage, "In the Loop" provides us with a hilarious behind-the-scenes glimpse into the ugly, messy world of international diplomacy. The mad run-up to the Iraq war serves as the obvious blueprint for the fictional - yet far from make-believe - tale the writers have come up with here. We begin in London where news has just leaked out that the British and Americans are planning a military invasion of an unspecified country in the Middle East. When the bumbling Minister for International Development, Simon Foster, accidentally goes off script by stating in an interview that such a war is "unforeseeable," the Prime Minister's staff goes into immediate damage control mode, hustling Foster off to Washington D.C. to see if they can get him in on the pre-war planning and negotiations. From that point on, Foster becomes a bone-of-contention between the pro-war and anti-war factions battling it out for preeminence.

The source for "In the Loop" is a popular British TV series entitled "The Thick of It," with many of the actors from that program appearing in the movie (though we're told that most of the performers play different roles in the film from the ones they play on the show). As if that weren't confusing enough, the script by Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Armando Iannucci and Tony Roche spends virtually no time on introductions or back story of any kind, leaving those of us who are unfamiliar with the context feeling just a wee bit lost and disoriented at the beginning. Indeed, we are plunged so immediately into the swirl of activity surrounding the minister's diplomatic faux pas that we learn early on that we had better start paying some serious attention to what's happening on screen or risk going under in pretty short order. I say this not as a criticism of the writing because, frankly, this is one of the few comic scripts I've come across in quite some time that actually treats its audience like thinking adults, that doesn't find it necessary to talk down to us in order to appeal to the lowest-common-denominator viewer. The one-liners come fast and furious in this film and woe to anyone not willing to make the effort to keep up with them. The good news is that the writing is so sharp and acerbic that we really don't mind putting that extra added effort into our viewing. One simply cannot be a passive onlooker while watching "In the Loop" and still reap the rewards of the experience.

With the kind of understated irony that distinguishes the best of British humor, the densely-plotted, character-rich screenplay aims its comedic sights at all the would-be power players, petty backbiters, toadying assistants, long-suffering aides, incompetent bureaucrats, draconian bosses, mealy-mouthed office-holders and enraged constituents that make up the world of high-level diplomacy and politics. The movie also has some fun with England's perceived role as ugly stepsister (or lapdog, if you prefer) to the bully-boy United States in matters of world affairs.

Director Iannucci gets nothing less than a sterling performance from each and every member of his large and gifted cast, be they American (with James Gandolfini the most recognizable face in that crowd) or British. However, extra special note should be taken of Tom Hollander, Chris Addison, Mimi Kennedy and, above all, Peter Capaldi, who tears up the screen as the deliciously ill-tempered and foul-mouthed enforcer for the British Prime Minister.

The truths this allegorical fable reveals about how easy it is to cherry pick evidence to lead a country into war and how hard it is for individuals of goodwill to stand up for what they know is right are so dead-on in their accuracy and so universal in their scope that they leave the mind reeling from the impact - and the ribcage aching from all the laughter.

The new comedy, In The Loop is gonna become the exact definition of overlooked. While people are seeing bad movies like G-Force, and The Proposal, this gem is only being seen by an extremely limited audience. I saw this in what was basically a sold-out theater. That said, for all the people in this movie, there are 10 people seeing a bad, low-brow, mainstream film. In The Loop is the story of Simon Foster (played excellently by Tom Hollander), a politician who says war is unforeseeable, and is forced to resolve the problem, going as far as having to travel from London to Washington. With the help of his assistant, Toby (Chris Addison), he does his best to resolve the problem. James Gandolfini, an excellent actor, is amusing here as Lt. Gen. George Miller. The two main scene stealers are David Rasche as Linton Barwick, a politician who is against cussing, and Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker, an outrageous, out-of-control politician who could not be more mad at Simon. I am sad to inform In The Loop will be overlooked, and for the people who will see it will probably go see a low-brow mainstream film and totally forget this movie even existed. I suggest, though, for people reading this review, you should go see it, and try to remember it, and if any Oscar noms go to it, pray it will win. You won't be sorry if you go see this little gem.

This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. In fact, it's probably the best comedy film I've ever seen in my lifetime.

The film follows Simon Foster, an inept cabinet minister who makes a rather stupid comment on live radio. After the standard abuse session by his director of communications, he heads to Washington, where he attempts to regain his status a neutral man in the conflict for and against the war.

I thought much of the cast acted fantastically, especially James Gandolfini and of course, Peter Capaldi. The scene those two have with Gandolfini insulting Capaldi is hilarious, and for the punch line, the only real part that he takes offence to is when Gandolfini calls him English instead of Scottish. Capaldi is as brutish as he is in The Thick Of It, perhaps even more so.

Watch this movie. You'll be doing yourself a favour.

I had never heard of this movie until the Oscar nominees were announced earlier this month. There among the nominees of Best Adapted Screenplay was a movie entitled "In The Loop." That was the only nomination of this film, and that made me curious about it.

That singular nomination was so right. The star of this film is most certainly the script! It is so over-the-top satiric and sarcastic. I daresay it is an incredible showcase for very innovative use of the English language. I had never heard words combined in such a bitingly funny yet incisively on-point manner.

The whole story began with a seemingly naive statement made by the clueless British Secretary of State on the radio that "war is unforeseeable" when asked about an impending US military intervention in the Middle East. This sets off a cascade of opposite reactions from both sides of the Atlantic as pro- and anti-war proponents face-off against each other with their conflicting views.

Fans of British black comedy will enjoy this film, which was apparently adapted by director Armando Iannucci from his BBC series called "The Thick of It." I do not get to watch enough British TV myself, but I really enjoyed the rapidly witty exchange of words by the characters. The excessive profanity seems so fit in this situation, I could not imagine any other words to use to replace them. They even make fun of their own profanity in one sequence. So funny.

I did not know most of the British cast but their performances are very entertaining as they brought the script to life with so much zip. Their very effective delivery makes the script work. Kudos to Peter Capaldi for his unflinching portrayal of the war-freak Malcolm. His fearless verbal assaults are sharper and deadlier than any weapon here. The American cast was more familiar with James Gandolfini there as a pacifist general, and Anna Chlumsky as an aide who wrote a controversial anti-war paper.

Overall, while this film is very good, it is definitely not for all audiences. The action here is in the words. I may not have been able to follow everything that was happening (like, what was that wall incident all about?) nor all the relentless British humor (should warrant a repeat watching), but I enjoyed myself nevertheless. You might enjoy it too.

I have seen my fair share of political films both satirical and serious, but I've never quite seen a film like In the Loop before. It's brilliant use of language, something that is so vital in the world of politics, will have you rolling in the aisles or off your couch. This is like "The West Wing" meets Superbad.

In the Loop follows the events following a radio broadcast of UK cabinet member Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) and his remarks on the an ongoing development with the US and a foreign nation they are feuding with. When words are misinterpreted and comments can't be taken back, things take a turn for the worse. Another higher ranking cabinet member, Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi), comes in and tries to fix this problem between the two countries.

Across the pond, the several US politicians jump in the mix and use Foster's words and try to put fuel on the fire for the war or try to snuff it out. Secret committees are revealed, sides are chosen, and the youth of America are given much more power than they can handle. I like to think this is really how the government is run.

What surprised me the most, other than the offensive language, is how effective the language is. It was like I was at Judd Apatow or Adam McKay film with a lot of association comedy and crude jabs thrown in every direction. I could hardly contain myself when one person from the UK tells Foster's aide to be quiet, referring to him as, "Love Actually." I could hardly contain myself.

The entire cast, both on the UK side and the US, especially James Gandolfini as Lt. Gen. George Miller, give superb performances. The characters are quick, full of life, and executed perfectly by the actors.

Director Armando Iannucci, as well as the contributing writers, have received several nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) for there work in television. This is their first feature film production, and what a debut. It has the feel of a TV show like "The Office" and the tempo of modern comedy like Knocked Up or Superbad.

In the Loop was sadly put on limited release and probably won't get the respect and praise it deserves, but you should definitely see it if you find it either in theaters or on store shelves. It's a very timely and very worth while investment of your time.

I found this to be a terrific diversion from summer cinema -- a sort of a mash-up of "The West Wing," "Dr. Strangelove" and "The Office" (the U.K. version). Great dialog, proper cynicism (directed equally at British and American buffoons) and enough plot twists to stay engaged. My only quibbles are (1) the ending was not too satisfying (although admittedly probably closer to real life than the movies) and (2) there is really no one to root for (ditto). I work in the entertainment industry and the prospects of major studios producing mid-budget character- and/or issue-driven movies continues to dwindle, even when major stars are attached. (And it doesn't help any when those few that are made don't do well at the box office and/or are homogenized into Hollywood thrillers or morality tales, e.g., "State of Play" earlier this year.) I want to see more movies like "In the Loop."

Even though I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't honestly tell anyone what it's about, apart from the fact that it's a political satire that involves politicians from the UK and US. The joys of In the Loop are in the humorous dialogue and how the politicians are skewered for being incompetent, daft, or megalomaniac, or a combination of all three. It's also one of those movies that require multiple viewings to catch everything since the dialogue is machine gun- fast, and I'm actually hankering to watch it again. 

Apparently the movie's a spin-off of a Brit TV series, The Thick of It, and it shares its director and some of the cast. Had never heard of it but now I'm curious. Generally I'm not a fan of British TV, with some notable exceptions. I think my sense of pop culture is too firmly entrenched in the US.

I'm giving it a 9 for now but I suspect I might elevate it to a 10 once I get around to re-watching it.

During a fit of collective insanity the British people voted for a charlatan snake-oil salesman to be Prime Minister in 1997 and then re-elected him twice more. This film (together with the TV series from which it is a spin-off) is a record of the disgusting, bullying manner in which Tony Blair's head spin doctor, (actually a man named Alastair Campbell, but here named Malcolm Tucker) ran the government.

It nicely paints a picture of just one of the ineffectual, dim, gaff-prone and incompetent ministers with which Saint Tony surrounded himself. Unfortunately we never get to glimpse the more senior figures of this feckless government, Gordon Brown and the appalling Mr Blair himself.

Quite bravely, the film sets out how the "intelligence" was manipulated by Campbell/Tucker in such a way that it gave credence to the necessity for the Iraq war. With hindsight this is perhaps the most egregious example of outrageous behaviour on his part, but maybe there are other examples still to come out. But it literally beggars belief that an unelected oaf like Campbell/Tucker should have been given the power and authority to act on the Prime Minister's behalf in the way that he did.

It has been pointed out that this film does for contemporary politics what "Yes Minister" did in the 1980s. Very true. Ministers are shown as complete bloody fools being manipulated by the Civil Servants ("Yes Minister") or private office appointees ("In the Loop"). "Yes Minister" was also quite misleadingly described as "Comedy". No, this will not do. Both these pieces are documentary, but funny nevertheless.

You laugh at the time, but if you think about it, you cry. What a state we have come to.

The premise is that the US and Great Britain, plus via UN meetings, are trying to decide whether to start a war in the Middle East. On each side of the pond you have young staffers who are trying to do the RIGHT thing, by gathering facts, weighing pros ands cons. At the same time you have the grizzled veterans on both sides trying to stack the agenda to get what they want. To change a report and to edit the facts to suit their agenda is commonplace.

Make no mistake, this is not intended to be an objective look at how these things like this get done, but I couldn't help being reminded of the US invasion of Iraq and the subsequent deposing of Saddam Hussein. The reason given was WMDs, but after the fact no WMDs were ever found. From news reports available to all of us, it seemed like the politicians and military leaders stacked the deck there also, to justify an invasion.

This is a funny movie, and the dialog is very inventive, especially the rude and crude insults that are thrown around, most by the British guys. I don't usually tolerate movies filled with F-bombs, but this one is very funny.

IN THE LOOP is a well made, fast paced political satire that is well worth seeing if you like smart, clever comedy. The script just zooms along as we watch both the British and the American government do what they do best - what ALL governments do best - which is - cover their asses and look out for Number One. The cast is fantastic - Mimi Kennedy nails the role of Karen Clark as well as Tom Hollander as Foster and Peter Capaldi as Tucker. Capaldi chews up the scenery as the damage control expert who tells his Minister what to do and what to say. The always strong Gina McKee is a delight (her work in Notting Hill and Croupier is well worth seeing) and to see the star of the American 90's tween hit My Girl - Anna Chlumskey (sp?) all grown up as Liza - Karen Clark's aide is amazing. Laugh out loud funny, pop culture references and international insults fly by like rockets - you have to pay attention in this movie! A welcome political comedy. Bravo!

When I first saw In the Loop, almost six months ago, I had never heard of The Thick of It, let alone seen it. Recently discovering it, I've now seen all of the episodes and, on the basis of the sheer quality of the writing and its ability to reduce me to tears of laughter, decided to watch In the Loop again.

A satirical parody of the lead up to the UK/US invasion of Iraq, In the Loop follows several characters and their respective journeys to provoke or avoid the war. Malcolm Tucker, the famed TV character, leads the show as the Prime Minister's man on the ground, abusing and bullying his way to the fulfillment of his boss' objectives. James Gandolfini leads the American cast as the General determined to keep his country in peaceful times.

The film opens with a quick introduction to the political world it is set in. Toby Wright is the audience surrogate, showing us the running of the Department for International Development. With a wide range of characters and a complex interlinking of their roles and allegiances, In the Loop manages to keep us informed of what is happening at all times, its pacing allowing us to keep up whilst also mimicking the hasty headlong rush into war. The humour in the film is relentless, intelligent, layered and perfectly delivered. Capaldi is nothing short of incredible, continuing the fiery anger and ruthless efficiency of his character on the big screen, his foul mouthed diatribes wielding filthy language with an unparalleled hilarity. The rest of the performances are similarly brilliant, the likes of James Gandolfini and Tom Hollander forming great, interesting, and wonderfully flawed caricatures of politics. Steve Coogan, in a relatively small role, adds a wonderful touch to the film, demonstrating with a fantastic performance the consistent failings of the characters to deal with even simple situations. The film manages to give us 100+ minutes of laughter while also attracting our attention to the real world madness of politics and the corruption, deception, and moral ambiguity of the key players in this escalating situation.

In the Loop takes an incredibly ingenious, funny, and sharp script, infuses it with exceptional performances, and presents us with a biting satire of political incompetency and foolishness. Brimming with unforgettable insults and memorable tirades of abuse, it surpasses average humour, establishing itself as one of the most original, intelligent, and masterful works of comedy in recent years.

You might remember nothing else from "In the Loop" other than its landmark insults, but that's enough. This high-brow dirty British humor from the writing team behind the hit British political comedy show "The Thick of It" is exceptional and its ability to intelligently prod at politics is almost more of a bonus.

"In the Loop" puts a finger on politics as the art of undoing hypocrisies. From the beginning, the film is about British Minister of International Development, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) trying to recant a statement that war with a certain Middle Eastern country is "unforeseeable." He then ends up telling the press one must "climb the mountain of conflict to walk the path of peace." He is a PR nightmare, but his conflicting statements have attracted both pro and anti-war mid-level government powers in America who intend to use him as "meat." Trying to conduct this chaotic orchestra is a fantastic supporting role from Scot Peter Capaldi as the vulgar and disparaging Malcolm Tucker, the prime minister's PR man.

It's kind of fascinating to watch a political film where the president and prime minister are faceless. I think that's part of what makes "In the Loop" effective as well. Everyone is just a pawn in what will make or break the image of guy at the top of the chain. There are a lot of young people in the cast, which shows the large percentage of the young workforce in Washington. These characters are slowly evolving into the snide and blunt government veterans they work for, which helps complete the hysterical portrait of politics director Armando Iannucci is going for.

Do yourself a service and go straight to the IMDb memorable quote page for this film. That's where "In the Loop" gets its appeal. Certainly the uninhibited superfluous trading of high- brow insults aren't for everyone, but there's definitely an audience of film buffs that will enjoy intellectual humor as a break from its banal physical counterpart.

Being essentially a spin-off of his hit BBC comedy series "The Thick of It", "In the Loop" is an astonishing full-length debut by Armando Iannucci. This is a foul-mouthed political satire on the events that led to Iraq War. While retaining the stark realism, "In the Loop" is insanely funny. There are over thirty genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this movie, which is about 5 times more than in your usual comedy. The humour mostly stems from hilarious dialogue that is both immensely clever and offensive. It abounds with irony, numerous malicious accusations as well as some highly controversial ideas of the amazingly prolific group of screenwriters. In addition, the movie tops basically every farce I've seen with its top-notch performances. Oscar-winner Peter Capaldi is amazing as an enormously abusive director of communications Malcolm Tucker. His priceless sayings like "Fuckity bye" seem very quotable. The rest of the cast involving Tom Hollander, James Gandolfini and Gina McKee also deliver superb comedic performances. The characters created by them are hilarious, yet authentic enough to make you wonder if they're really completely fictional. To conclude, with its flawless script and endless streak of laughs "In the Loop" is, alike Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove", a seminal political satire.

"In the Loop" is a British satire film documenting the questionable push towards war with Iraq by the United States and the UK. Included in the film is a send up of civilian leaders pushing the war, peace loving Generals, hard line media relation bureaucrats, hapless nice guy politicians, political networking, sexual relations, questionable evidence, and analytical reports swept under the rug (and subsequently leaked). In short, "In the Loop" encapsulates in 100 minutes all of the purported scandal involved in the build up to the Iraq war by its two main proponent countries.

The movie begins with Toby (Chris Addison) reporting to work for a middling Minister in Parliament called Simon Foster (brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hollander). Toby immediately draws the ire of relations guru, the foul mouth insult factory Malcolm (Peter Capaldi, Torchwood: Children of the Earth). Though it is hard to given top billing in this great ensemble cast, Malcolm is one of the most constant characters and easily the most memorable.

Foster is already in some trouble with Malcolm and the more senior officials due to not keeping his statements in-line with regards to the war while guesting on a talk show. Meanwhile Toby has an inside track to get Foster face time with the American Karen Clark, a U.S. Representative struggling to sniff our clandestine meetings and committees that she believes are pushing for the war to be inevitable. Clark's aid, Liza (Anna Chlumsky), has drafted a paper that weighs the pros and cons of war and questions the sources of intelligence information. That paper, referred to by dense acronymeese, goes against the predominate climate in Washington which is to push towards war and its revelation to the public could have dire consequences for the war proponents.

The style of the movie is from a fly-on-the-wall perspective similar to The Office but without the documentary-like interview interludes. The camera follows Foster, Toby, Malcolm, Liza, and Karen make the political rounds from London, to Washington, and to the U.N. while maintaining a daft air of incompetence and humor.

The humor and zingers in "In the Loops" come fast and furious, especially in the interaction between Malcolm and Foster. The political representation is over-the-top, but for any that has been involved in politics or covering politics, it's an all too realistic level of absurdity. I have a feeling that folks that were pro war in the first place may not like the film except possibly in the way that the staunch anti-war politicians are portrayed just as frivolous as the supporters are portrayed hawkish. The level of political innuendo and depiction of networking and behind the scenes banter come off at least as chuckle inducing if not side splitting. Perhaps our reservation in laughing is due to the implication and the feeling that what is being shown as absurdity is not far off from what happens in real life. On a more lighthearted note, the image of two men sitting around in suit shirts, ties, underwear, and black calf socks is all too real. I've been on enough business trips to have seen that scene time and again but have never thought of how usual it would also be for traveling politicians and aids.

"In the Loop" is a 100 minute gag real ranging from wry humor to outright hilarity. The subject is serious, but is dealt with in such outlandish whimsy that the film never reaches a level of preachy (that I can tell). Those sympathetic to the reasons for the Iraq war that cannot separate their politics from entertainment may be aggrieved by the movie. However those who are apolitical, open minded to entertainment, or of course were against the war in the first place will find plenty of laughs.
