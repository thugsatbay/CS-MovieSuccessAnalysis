### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Watching a 7.5-hour long documentary about a case we all think we know may seem a daunting task at first, but trust me: you'll have a very hard time to resist the urge to binge watch the whole mini series once you've started. This documentary (which to me felt like a seven-and-a-half-hour feature film) is - in my humble opinion - one of the greatest achievements in American filmmaking and utterly captivating from the beginning to the end.

Where the equally brilliant but fictional series 'The Wire' took the topic of crime as a means to cast a look at all aspects and social layers of a whole city (Baltimore), 'O.J.: Made in America' examines the life and crimes of a single man (albeit one leading a very public life) to cast a very close look at American society as a whole, and the result is the most complete in depth analysis of our divided nation's collective psyche I have ever seen.

The portrait that emerges is so fascinating and so revealing and educational (and I hate to admit: thrillingly entertaining) that I believe this should be recommended viewing in schools and colleges across the country. And if you think: "Meh, I know that story, it's been all over the news - not interested", think again. Trust me, you do not know this story (or better: these stories). And there's a big chance you'll understand a great deal more about America once you've finished watching this masterpiece.

I know I'm dishing out superlatives here, but it's like director Ezra Edelman made the ultimate documentary - perhaps even the ultimate film. 'O.J.: Made in America' functions on so many levels; it's like watching a whole collection of films where the same protagonist inexplicably lives through a wide array of very different stories (which somehow STILL manage to end up as ONE cohesive tale). Just to give you an impression how rich this documentary is, I tried to count the stories and most dominant themes and found at least 10 (although you could probably find more): 

1. There's the fascinating story of a poor kid from the ghetto rising through sheer will and enormous talent to become an American icon and superstar.

2. There's a great - and uplifting - sport story (especially for Football fans) that is usually the material of Hollywood films.

3. There's the very human drama of a genuine love story turning into an abusive relationship plagued by domestic violence.

4. There's the mesmerizing and shocking murder mystery;

5. the thrilling courtroom drama;

6. a razor-sharp satire about our and our media's unhealthy fixation on celebrities;

7. an unbelievable, surreal story of a nationwide man-hunt that gives Spielberg's 'Sugarland Express' a run for its money;

8. a close examination of the U.S. judicial system;

9. the story of the rise and the very, very steep fall of a man who had it all and lost everything;

10. an eye-opening story about race relations in America over the past 50 years

And as incredible as it may seem, those stories are all real. 

The way Edelman managed to put them all together to forge this groundbreaking documentary can't be praised enough. A unique experience. 10 stars out of 10.

This is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen. After recently watching the "not as good" "The People vs OJ Simpson" with John Travolta and Cuba Gooding Jr. This documentary was definitely a breath of fresh air.

The depth of it, the attention to all the details, the interviews, the massive amount of research that has gone into it. It is massive, to make this documentary is a tremendous undertaking, and is nothing but outstanding. It manages to keep you nailed to your seat for almost 8 hours, you sit and watch as you shake your head in disbelief. This documentary is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Even though most of us have heard about this story time and time again, and made up our minds years ago, the documentary gives you a new fresh look at things, you start from the very beginning. We follow OJ all the way back to when he started to become noticed as a good football player, and we follow him all the way to his fall from the top of the mountain.

The documentary does not take sides, which would be a terrible decision for any director to pursue, so after you have seen it, you have the ability to make up your own mind. Did OJ do it? Or did he not? I was never in doubt he was guilty of killing his wife and her friend, and this documentary didn't strengthen my opinion or weaken it, but it made me feel so sorry for Nicole Simpson and what she had been through, it is truly heartbreaking. I sit her and feel i wish i could go back in time and save her.

All the beatings, the abuse and the terror she had to endure through the years, she was the mother of his children, and was slaughtered as a pig, left to bleed out alongside her friend who were also bleeding out. And the guy who did it, got away free with murder. Horrible, just horrible.

The documentary does not filter this by censuring crime scene photos, no it shows them in close ups. To see what rage a person must have felt the moment he slices a woman's throat right in to her neck while she is still alive.

Now this is graphic, it is, but i think the documentary does it right by showing this to us. This is about the trial of the century, where a famous man faces the most famous justice system in the world. Will this justice system judge him based on the evidence?. Well most of us already know the outcome.

But why did this end the way it did?. There are details we have never seen or heard before, there are people that has not been able to speak out properly, this documentary has gathered key people from OJ's life all the way back to his childhood, and it builds an image of him, detailed, slowly, but never boring, it shows us who OJ really was, and how he became that way.

All the years after the murder of his wife, and OJ did nothing to find "the real killer". He was laughing and dancing, he had custody of his children, he lived a good life in a very nice house, and lived the dream as most others can't even dream of.

Watching all these clips of him, doing all this, and celebrating life as it was himself that was the god of it all, made me feel deeply sad for Nicole. If only someone had prevented this, if only someone could have done something.

I can never get those images of Nicole and Ron's crime scene photos out of my head. But i had to see them to feel how i do now.

Amazing documentary, highly recommended, both for those who know about the case and followed it, and for those who know nothing about it. See it, learn from it, and take in that this can actually happen.

My verdict is : 10/10

I have been very impressed with the scope and quality of this much anticipated documentary. While I enjoyed the inaugural season of American Crime Story with O.J. Simpson as its subject, it was a) a dramatization, and b) solely focused on the infamous murder case. This documentary, on the other hand takes us back to OJ's junior college days and examines, as its title suggests, what made O.J. Simpson the man he became. Seeing the rise of Simpson's football stardom put in context of the turbulent times during his days at USC was eye- opening. Using a bounty of old footage and interviews, we are shown the single-mindedness and sense of purpose that drove O.J. from the earliest days of his career and his complete disconnect from the racial tensions and the equal rights movement going on around him - perhaps, tellingly so. The filmmakers also do an amazing job of examining the people, the events and circumstances in the Los Angeles community which led an atmosphere in the city that undeniably had an impact on the investigation, the trial and the verdict in what has rightly been called the trial of the century.

(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5) 

THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 

IN BRIEF: A compelling documentary that focuses on a city on fire and the "Trial of the Century".

GRADE: B+

SYNOPSIS: The O.J. Simpson trial and the many factors influencing the verdict and its aftermath.

JIM'S REVIEW: There is a fascinating 7½ hour documentary that premiered on ABC and ESPN television stations this past week and is currently streaming which is worth your attention. O.J.: Made in America may be overly long and in some need of judicious editing in parts, but it is a fascinating in-depth look back at the "Trial of the Century" and its repercussions that are relevant today. 

￼The brutal murder of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown and her friend, Ron Goldman, on June 12, 1994 immediately made headlines and spawned a media circus, showing the incompetent handling of the case by the LAPD and District Attorney's office, and the unethical maneuverings of the prosecuting team, led by Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran, to free their client and exploit the legal system.

￼Documentarian Ezra Edelman culled over hours of archival footage, news segments, and interviews (both then and now) to create a timely chronicle of the O.J. Simpson trial and the political unrest of a racially-divided city. He delves into the numerous 911 calls prior to the murder and Nicole's personal diary with many passages about the physical abused she suffered in her marriage to this volatile celebrity. Mr. Edelman astutely assembles new interviews with many of the people involved with the case which brings us access to observe a broken judicial system in retrospect. 

The documentary shares a balanced look at the man and equally at the era. It begins with a before-and-after approach, first showing this famous incarcerated man and providing flashbacks depicting an up-and-coming young college athlete beginning his exulted career. The effect is startling. Seeing O.J. in his prime sheds new light of the man and his later fall from grace. We learn about his homophobia toward his gay estranged father, his gift for talking himself out of situations at an early age (which may have given him a false sense of security throughout his life), his lack of involvement with Civil Right issues, his innate kindness to his teammates, and the tragic death of his daughter which ended his first marriage, events that were unknown to this reviewer. We also hear of O.J's constant womanizing, his insatiable ego, his life cavorting with the rich and famous of Brentwood, his sexist and privileged attitude, and his intense jealousy and violence toward his second wife that went unheeded. Fame and wealth brought him the good life and finally corrupted the man.

￼But the other character in this multi-faceted tragedy is L.A. itself and the racism and injustice by the police force. Mr. Edelman's need to parallel these two tangents with the murder trial itself to make his film more complete is noteworthy, but it also gives his documentary too much latitude into this area. The film meanders into the prejudice and hate that was so rampant at the time, with the Watts riots, the Rodney King beating, and the senseless murders of African- Americans in the hands of the LAPD as the backdrop to the subsequent trial. Perhaps too much time is spent on this topic (and the famous Bronco chase) which is overstated but essential filler. Here is an accused man who erased race from his own life only to rely on it later for his freedom. That is just one irony among many. (Another is Simpson's ability to pay for his legal defense via selling autographed sports memorabilia when still being incarcerated for these murders.)

￼The numerous interviews and comments with former friends and colleagues are enlightening and seeing the actual cast of characters that played their parts in the trial is riveting. Particularly memorable are the words of attorney Marcia Clark, a still grieving Fred Goldman, former head D.A. Gil Garcetti, prosecuting lawyer Carl Douglas, detectives Tom Lange and Mark Fuhrman, and former friends Robin Greer, Ron Shipp, and Joe Bell. Their personal knowledge adds important details to this complicated story.

￼Probably the most interesting aspect about the film is the mixed emotions and personal biases felt by the jurors. (Deliberations of the verdict lasted a few hours with one member, a former Black Panther, saluting the plaintiff upon exiting the jury box.) That, and the questionable decisions handed down by the judge, Lance Ito, throughout the trial helped the prosecution play their successful "race card". Unable to see certain evidence (O.J. prior violent activities, the 911 calls, the graphic blood scene photos, the direct DNA blood connection), and falling for the grandstanding antics of that bloodied glove and a pre-staged jury's visit to Simpson's home completely changed for maximum African-American emphasis, the outcome seemed like a sure acquittal from the start. (That latter stunt by the prosecution team alone would have created a mistrial today.) O.J. may have been found not guilty, (no spoiler here), but the LAPD and their botched investigation were the ones really on trial.

￼O.J.: Made in America is a powerful documentary and one of the year's best films. (One would hope that it would qualify for Academy Award consideration next year, although it eluded any theatrical release as yet.) The film depicts an America filled with racial hate and anger. It shines a spotlight on domestic abuse issues. It highlights our fascination with celebrity worship and a willingness to give free rein to the lifestyle of the rich and famous while two innocent people receive no sign of justice. Mr. Edelman's epic achievement may give these victims their dues and finally a bit of justice as well.

When you board this fast moving train of a documentary, just remember....its an express. You can't get off until it arrives at its final destination. It takes you through O.J.'s birth in 1947 to current day O.J.. Masterfully edited and pieced together as if it were some kind of gigantic puzzle, then released to us in the form of a spectacular documentary that shall go down as one of the best (including Ken Burns work), if not the best, ever made. You cannot stop watching it once you start, so brace yourself for over seven hours of totally engrossing and fascinating film. Not even the best fiction writers could dream up anything better than this....and this is nothing but pure, unadulterated reality....true life with real deaths. The details, some very grisly, are in the film. This is a Jekyll and Hyde film that actually happened, and continues today as O.J. continues his miserable existence as a prison inmate. -30-

This documentary explores the murder trial of O.J. Simpson - but it focuses not only on the lives of the people involved - but also the socio-political backdrop of Los Angeles. A city where the police acted as a militarized force against the black communities at a disparaging rate - and the courts seemed to protect the police and persecute the blacks. At the same time - to be rich in Los Angeles - was to be able to literally - get away with cold blooded murder. 

From out of this landscape - came the crime of the century. Where the beloved and wealthy O.J Simpson - a college football star, professional player, move star, and celebrity, was accused of a horrific homicide - taking a knife and butchering his wife and her friend. He would then lead the police on bizarre chase that was watched by millions of Americans. He was even cheered on by thousands of people who waited on the road to watch him pass by.

After his arrest came the trial of the century - a tale that not even Shakespeare could have written. The trial would be broadcast live and watched by millions of people around the world. It was one of the biggest events in history. The defense was made up of a team of specialists who were paid fifty thousand dollars a day to poke holes in the prosecutors case - and boy did they ever! Racist cops. Allegedly planted evidence. Murder gloves that do not fit.

But what makes this more interesting - is that despite the defense theories - the evidence against O.J Simpson was overwhelming. He was home at the time of the murders. He had a history of severe domestic abuse. Stalking. He had cuts on his hands from a knife that he could not explain. There was simply no one else with the means, motive, and opportunity to murder these people. Yet - the jury acquitted him after only three hours of deliberation! 

The jurors were made up of nine black women. The DA had decided to keep the trial in downtown Los Angeles so it would seem to be a more balanced prosecution. But the jury would later admit that O.J Simpson was acquitted because they wanted revenge on the city of Los Angeles for the mistreatment of the black community at the hands of the police department. After the footage the documentary shows - it is difficult not to sympathize with the jurors plight. Their community was under siege. They retaliated. 

Even more astonishing - was that OJ Simpson had never been a defender of the black community. In fact, he had distanced himself from the black community almost all of his life. Yet they protected him - and to the black community it was a sign of progress for a black person who be acquitted in a court of law - even if they were guilty. Perhaps that is a racial quagmire that I - and all other white people - should fathom - before we pass judgment? 

OJ Simpson would be found not guilty, but his crimes would haunt him for the rest of his days. His friends distanced themselves. He lost much of his fortune. He was even found liable in a civil trial of the murders. His life imploded into drugs, alcohol, and buffoonery. He ran with a crew of misfits and losers and scumbags and con artists. Finally - he would commit a stupid armed robbery to get some of his old memorabilia back and he would at last be sentenced to decades in prison. 

One cannot help but notice that all of America is on trial in this documentary - and that in a sense - justice was indeed done. The city of Los Angeles was punished for their crimes. O.J. Simpson was finally punished for his crimes. Perhaps there is no way to make sense out of all of this - except to learn from this story - and try not to repeat history? 

I should ad - this documentary is simply far more complex than any written review can explain. It had tremendous interviews with the colorful cast of characters involved. Footage of heartbreaking loss. Intense struggle. And even the heroic actions of the family of the murder victims - whose pursuit of justice would not go unanswered.

The second episode in the five-part series "O.J.: Made in America" attempts to weave together two stories. The film provides in-depth coverage of (1) the racially insensitive and abusive practices of the Los Angeles police department and the judicial system in the 1970s and '80s and (2) the troubled marriage of O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown, focusing on the well-documented pattern of domestic abuse. 

At the core of the film's depiction of LAPD is the Rodney King incident. The filmmakers' decision to play over and over the amateur film footage of the beating of King reinforces the severity of the violence of this disgraceful incident. The incomprehensible verdict in exonerating the four white police officers who committed the beating speaks volumes about the amoral police department and the judicial system of Los Angeles.

The profile of law enforcement in Los Angeles was the backdrop for the substantial evidence of domestic abuse committed by O.J. Simpson. Through documentary materials (including Nicole's diary and police reports) and eyewitness testimony, it becomes clear that as a celebrity, O.J. Simpson had enough clout to prevent the star-struck LAPD from prosecuting him for domestic abuse.

The hypocrisy of individual police offers is truly appalling, as depicted in the film. One scene recounts how two Brentwood cops would knock on the door of Simpson's home just to bask in the glow of the magical aura of "The Juice." The racist approach to law enforcement in the highly segregated Los Angeles basin was contrasted with the double standard applied to Simpson, whose celebrity status apparently offered him immunity from prosecution for serious offenses in domestic violence.

One of the most shocking moments in the film was the testimony of a policeman with integrity, who arrived at the Simpson home after one of Nicole's 911 calls. The officer prepared a detailed report of the injuries to Nicole, then kept a personal copy, suspecting that O.J. would be given a free pass by the high command of the Brentwood police. According to the cop, the number of incidents and the severity of the abuse should have resulted in the prosecution of O.J. Simpson for a felony. According to the cop, O.J. even fled the scene in his Bentley in order to avoid talking to police. Apparently even fleeing a crime scene did not figure in the LAPD's brazen failure to enforce the law and protect Nicole.

In this extremely well-researched and well-produced episode, the viewer is left with disgust at the conduct of the LAPD and the breakdown of the American judicial system that was apparent long before "the trial of the century." One also wonders why prosecutor Marcia Clark could not have presented the facts about Simpson's long-standing pattern of domestic abuse as effectively as the makers of this documentary film.

O.J. Simpson: Made in America Part 2 (2016)

**** (out of 4) 

This second episode starts of O.J. is retiring from football and continuing onto his second career of acting and becoming a businessman. The darker side of things also begin to show up as his domestic abuse comes out in the media and he and Nicole begin to separate. Also, the Rodeny King beating and eventual riots are shown as the LAPD take an even bigger hit.

The first two parts of this series have certainly been something very special because it's trying to tell two different stories at once and it's doing a brilliant job at both of them. What's funny is that the first episode shows you that O.J. that most people have forgotten about and after watching this second episode it's easy to see why. There's no question that this episode is much darker in tone and it's certainly a great warning for what is about to follow.

Once again director Ezra Edelman does a masterful job at telling both stories and knowing how to perfectly blend them together. The most chilling stuff here deals with the 911 calls that Nicole made with us getting to hear the unedited rage of O.J. in the background. We also hear from one of Nicole's boyfriends who talk about the various run-ins he had with O.J.. There's no question that the director is slowly building up what is to follow.

ESPN tackles the subject of O.J. Simpson in an in-depth documentary start from his football career to his L.A. life to the trial and finally his conviction in a different case. After the compelling American Crime Story, this is a great way to provide the context. This is not simply a sports doc or a doc about the trial. This digs into the pervasive racism in the LAPD and the history of race conflicts in the area. It's also very in-depth in its examination of O.J.'s personality. This doc lays it all out very well. The trial itself is less in-depth but it's interesting in a couple of ways. There are two of the jurors as well as a harrowing explanation and pictures of the crime scene. They really bring out more reality out of the trial. This fills out everything surrounding the case. The ACS is a fun pseudo-reality drama. This doc is great at filling out the actual reality.

Well is it the final chapter? I seriously doubt it. We all must have seen numerous documentaries about OJ and what happened or didn't happen and we all have our own version of what we think happened. Some older people (like me) may remember watching this as it happened and some may have caught up after the fact but it's still a fascinating watch.

This is as comprehensive as it gets, and at seven and a half hours does cover it very comprehensively. I did it in three instalments and never got bored on any occasion. It was factual, with actual footage of the trail, and is updated with commentary provided by many who were involved.

I'm not gonna take sides and slam or praise anyone but be assured, you will. No matter how you think things went down you will have a good guy and bad guy scenario and like me you will become a little louder than normal.

Well worth a watch even though it takes a while.

Episode Four of "O.J.: Made in America" is arguably the most riveting of the five segments of the series. In this two-hour program, the filmmakers have dynamically synthesized the essence of the trial. It is especially the interviews that help to shed light on the cultural significance of the "trial of the century." Through this documentary, a number of questions arise about the competence of the prosecutors in presenting their case. For instance: 

(1) Why couldn't the physical evidence in the murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman have been presented as clearly and dramatically as it was in this program? One of the most chilling sequences was Bill Hodgman's hypothetical reconstruction of the murders. It was only several minutes of time in the program, yet in the real trial the prosecutors never synthesized the massive evidence with the skill and effectiveness of this documentary film.

(2) Why didn't Ron Shipp's courtroom testimony have the same emotional impact as conveyed in this documentary program? This enormously sympathetic witness, who knew O.J. Simpson as a close friend since the time he was sixteen, came to the conclusion that Simpson was guilty of the murders. Yet Shipp was mercilessly defamed by the "dream team." The prosecution should have made a greater attempt to object when Shipp's character was being maligned by the defense. 

(3) How could the LAPD forensic team have been so sloppy in their gathering of the crime scene evidence? Due to the high profile of the case, they knew they were being filmed while collecting blood samples, yet failed to follow some of the most basic protocol of handling evidence. Surely, one of the most outrageous acts was to draw blood from Simpson after the arrest, then take it back to the crime scene, prior to sending it to the lab! One of jurors indicated how convincing was the defense attorney Barry Scheck in challenging the authenticity of the DNA evidence. But the LAPD made Scheck's job easier with their unprofessional work.

(4) How could the LAPD have kept on Mark Fuhrman in his responsible position as a detective? And how could the DA's office not have investigated his background, prior to calling him as a key witness? While the program focuses extensively on how Fuhrman figured prominently in the Simpson trial, it fails to note that even with the passing of twenty years, race is STILL a divisive and controversial dimension in high-profile trials. Hence the importance of employing law enforcement officers who are not documented racists.

There is no doubt that led by the brilliant Johnnie Cochran, the "dream team" of O.J. Simpson was successful in persuasively casting doubt on major pieces of evidence presented by Marcia Clark and Chris Darden. A question for viewers of this film to ponder is: Did the defense team win the trial of the century through legal cleverness and playing the "race card," or did the prosecution lose it through incompetency?

O.J.: Made in America Part 1 (2016) 

**** (out of 4) 

The first part of the five part series takes a look at the early days of O.J. Simpson as he became a star at USC before heading to the NFL where he would struggle at first before eventually going for 2,000 yards in one season. While all of this is going on on the field, off he's becoming more and more popular through various ads where he becomes a spokesman who can target both white and black America.

There have been countless documentaries done on O.J. Simpson and I think many wondered what the point of another one was. I've seen most of the films out there on Simpson and I too wondered if a seven plus hour documentary was needed. Well, this first part was somewhat of a revelation because it really makes you remember what O.J. was like before those 1994 events. The first part of this documentary is really remarkable because of how many great details are packed into the running time and it perfectly captures the mood of the country as well as what made O.J. so special that he could take it over.

Not only is the college and NFL career of O.J. covered but so are his Hollywood days where he really made an impact even when most were probably betting against him. The film also covers the Civil Rights movement where athletes like Jim Brown and Ali were willing to risk their career and money to take a stand while O.J. seemed to either not care or just didn't want to bother because he cared more about himself.

By the time this first episode is over you certainly have your brain re-charged on who O.J. was and you really can't wait to dig into the future episodes.

A little less than a century ago as of this writing, "The Crime of the Century" was the Lindbergh Kidnapping case, beginning with the kidnapping and eventually slaying of aviator Charles Lindbergh's son Charles Lindbergh Jr. in 1932 and ending with a conviction of a German immigrant in 1935. Similar to the O.J. Simpson case of 70 years later, the Lindbergh Kidnapping trial had the same kind of sensationalism: celebrity, murder, and public obsession. Reporters and newspapers were constantly offering up-to-date coverage to a public who couldn't get enough about the case. However, there is one huge difference between the two cases. While the Lindbergh case did reveal American distrust of immigrants in certain circumstances, it did not have the biting racial hostility which erupted into public view as with the O.J. Simpson case and the Rodney King case which occurred only three years earlier. What began as a case about the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson, famous American Football player and movie star, became a referendum about race.

The present documentary "O.J.: Made in America" is more than a chronological account of the events leading up to the murder of O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown-Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and the eventual indictment and acquittal of O.J. Simpson. It's really both a history of O.J. Simpson and the historical context of race relations in the United States in the mid-to-late 20th century, particularly in Los Angeles. Other athletes who fought the injustice of racial segregation and prejudice are briefly profiled, such as the late Mohammed Ali (formerly Cassius Clay) and track stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos who famously raised their fists to signify "Black Power" at the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City. During much of this tumultuous time, O.J. Simpson is strangely absent from the conflict even though he played football for USC and then eventually for the Buffalo Bills from the late 1960's and throughout the 1970's. (He ended his football career with the San Francisco 49ers at the end of the decade.)

Probably the most revealing aspect of the documentary which chronicles O.J.'s life is how disassociated he was from the African-American community and their struggles for racial equality. Yes, certainly he had African-American friends, but according to interviews in the documentary, he ingratiated himself into the upper-crust of the White community. At certain times in his career he is asked to participate in the cause of racial justice, but he declines, sometimes saying he's not an African-American, but instead saying "I'm O.J." For a time O.J. Simpson was quite possibly the most recognizable athlete in the United States, but he declined to use his status to assist in the cause of racial integration and judicial equality. While at face value there is nothing inherently wrong with his attitudes, it becomes a strange set-up for the events which follow. He divorced his African-American wife of nearly 12 years, Marguerite L. Whitley, and married white aspiring model and photographer Nicole Brown.

He had become, according to his closest associates, the "whitest" African-American in the United States. Even his first commercials with Hertz rental car have subtle undertones of racism. Certainly not overt but subtle. As one interviewee pointed out, when Simpson runs through the airport, he is only acknowledged by Whites. No other African-Americans appear in the advertisement. He is an African-American acknowledged by Whites but that doesn't mean there is a now a categorical acceptance of Blacks among White America. He is the exception rather than the rule. 

When O.J.'s former wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found slain, and O.J. became the prime suspect, now the tide of White "acceptance" had turned. As long as he was a successful football player, played in modestly successful films, and stayed out of trouble, which may have included the civil rights struggles, the White public embraced him. Now the White community turned on him as they felt betrayed, and the racial divides came under public scrutiny. (It was speculated that if he had been accused of murdering a black woman, the public would not have been nearly as obsessed with the case.) Certainly other celebrities have faced similar scrutiny and public anger, such as the attack on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan which was eventually pinned to her rival Tonya Harding. But none had ever broken down on such clearly racial divides. And when detective Mark Fuhrman, who claimed he found a bloody glove at the Simpson estate, was found to use racially explosive language, the racial tensions of Los Angeles were again displayed nationally. The trial was all but over. Some have speculated it was pay-back for the acquittals of the police officers in the Rodney King case.

This is a fascinating documentary whose subject matter transcends just the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. This story demonstrates how race does and continues to permeate aspects of American life. Interestingly, many Whites have claimed that defense attorney Johnny Cochran went "out of bounds" by playing the so-called "race card". While I respect those people's points of view, there are too many instances of injustice in which the race card wasn't played, such as in the brutal killing of adolescent Emmett Till in 1955. In no way do I wish to minimize the brutality of the slaying of Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ronald Goldman, but only to say that acts of similar violence and injustice have been perpetrated upon African-Americans and other racial minorities for going on several centuries. The idea that the Simpson acquittal was the grossest miscarriage of justice in the history of United States Jurisprudence is no less than ridiculous. Jim Crowe laws in the south affected thousands if not millions of African-Americans for many decades, some allowing the unjustifiable lynching of many innocent people. Maybe if anything, the case shows that when injustice does happen it is excruciating, no matter which race was victimized.

A very long (7.5 hours, split over 5 episodes) and interesting documentary about the O.J. Simpson trial, his life and all the events that surrounded the murder (Rodney King, the L.A. Riots and the attack on truck driver Reginald Denny). Race played a gigantic part in this trial and accordingly it plays a major role in this documentary.

The makers of this documentary did a very thorough and extensive work, with lots of footage from the time it happened and interviews with many of the major characters involved in the case.

The first episode tells the background story of O.J. Simpson basically from his youth. It's way too long and it's the ONLY episode that I found boring. IMHO you can skip it without losing any crucial information.

All the rest of the episodes are very interesting. BTW, it's the first time that I see photos of the victims and the brutality of the murder is shocking. The murderer cut their throats - especially Nicole's - almost decapitating her. Disgusting stuff.

It's amazing that O.J. Simpson came out as a free man from this trial. Even the Jurors interviewed have NO PROBLEM admitting that their vote wasn't for the case, but for getting revenge for racism. This is unbelievable and proves beyond doubt that the Jury system in America simply doesn't work.

The last episode tells everything that happened after the trial - and it's fascinating too.

On June 12th, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex-wife of lauded American football player and all-round superstar O.J. Simpson, was murdered, along with her friend Ron Goldman. Both were stabbed multiple times, with Nicole's injuries so severe that her head was almost completely severed from her body. The crime scene was appalling and was clearly the aftermath of a frenzied attack, with all evidence pointing to O.J.. What followed was truly the biggest media sensation of our time; a circus in the ugliest sense of the word which divided America between blacks and whites. The case continues to fascinate, and despite the many documentaries covering the trial, Ezra Edelman's O.J.: Made in America finds new ground to cover, interviewing practically anyone caught up in the trial and juxtaposing O.J.'s story with that of the horror of growing up black in Los Angeles.

Released as a five-part mini-series on ESPN for their 30 to 30 series, Made in America also made a limited appearance on cinema screen, and received its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Controversially, this qualified it as a feature and for the Best Documentary Academy Award (which it won), and watched as a whole the film runs at a whopping 7 hours plus. But anyone who states it was undeserved needs to watch the film again, as this is about as detailed, powerful and utterly gripping as documentary film-making gets. It seems to cover just about every angle, bringing in anybody who was anybody in the events leading up to the murder and the aftermath for revealing interviews, as well as boasting a stunning collection of archive footage. It's meticulously researched stuff, and even if you know the long-studied case back to front, you will still find something new. 

Starting way back, we are taken through O.J.'s rise as a star college football player, leaping over or barging through anybody who stood in his way. He was worshipped almost like a God, and took this success to an unhappy period as a professional playing in Buffalo, where he was away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. We move through his tearful retirement to his move into acting, where he appeared in the likes of Capricorn One (1977) and The Naked Gun (1988), and his successful run as the face of Hertz. There's also his initially sweeping love affair with a beautiful young blonde named Nicole Brown, before the reports of domestic violence began. We witness a black man becoming a superstar in a white world that falsely preached equality, and he sat comfortably in that world while his fellow African- Americans were suffering terrible abuse at the hands of the law. Time and time again we witness a black man, woman or child murdered, beaten or treated like a dog by the police, only for them to be acquitted of the crime. Payback, it would seem, was on the cards, as the trial of O.J. Simpson began.

We are left in no question as to whether or not O.J. did it. He comes across as a master manipulator, ready to throw anybody under the bus - and have them be grateful at the same time - if it will give him a foot forward. A controlling, egotistical bully who would leave visible prints of his boot on Nicole's face, he is truly the worst kind of scumbag. The outcome of the trial certainly isn't excused (the prosecutor reminds the court late on that nobody seems to remember than Nicole and Ron were the actual victims), but it goes some way to explain it. You can feel the anger brewing as the film goes on, and through some truly disturbing footage of the Rodney King beating and the murder of Latasha Harlin, makes you angry with them. It portrays an entire country divided, with the trial playing out as an obvious metaphor for a nation in complete disarray, while the disgusting flaws in the American Justice System are exposed to a bleary-eyed prosecution. It's a work of true scholarship and unyielding ambition, and a frightening indictment of just how little has changed.

One expects a rehash of the Los Angeles murder trial, and a reinforcement of long-held preconceptions. What one gets is an elaborate and fascinating look at:

- the man that was and is Orenthal James Simpson;

- the sociology and history of the Los Angeles from which OJ emerged in the late 1960s;

- race relations in America; 

- the witnesses and lawyers in the trial;

- key facts, strategies and events relating to the murders and the trial itself; and, 

- the Las Vegas, NV charges.

30 for 30 has presented some great stories, often under the radar for many people. This is one of the best it has ever done. Kudos to Ezra Edelman, et al. Amazing work.

*"Spoiler alert" - Not sure it's needed. Surprising facts and details are not disclosed, but the scope and depth of the production is in itself somewhat surprising. Hence the alert.

Episode 3 covers two main strands of the O.J. Simpson case: (1) the slow-motion freeway chase of a phalanx of L.A. police cars trailing A.C. Cowlings, who was driving the Ford Bronco north on interstate 5 to the Brentwood home of O.J. Simpson; and (2) the preliminary backdrop of the murder trial, including venue for the trial, selection of judge, and jury selection.

The first segment of the film focuses on the familiar Bronco chase, especially the gawkers cheering on O.J. from their positions on freeway overpasses and the sidestreets of Brentwood. This mindless flaunting of human stupidity in light of the murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman is truly appalling. The "Go, O.J.!" signs are certainly an essential part of the "O.J. made in America" theme of this film project.

The most compelling portion of the program was in the analysis of how race figured in the O.J. Simpson trial. To the credit of DA Gil Garcetti, the trial was held in the diverse downtown district of Los Angeles, as opposed to a predominantly white venue. The program hints that Garcetti may have been motivated by political reasons. Nonetheless, it was the right choice, especially in light of the travesty of justice in the Los Angeles trial of the officers involved in the Rodney King beating.

But clearly there were things beyond Garcetti's control when it came to matters of "fairness" in the trial. Without a doubt, the baggage of racism and double-standards of justice in Los Angeles figured in the O.J. Simpson trial. One of the key pieces of evidence, the glove found on Simpson's property that matched the other glove left at the crime scene, was discovered by Detective Mark Fuhrman. In light of the controversial background of Fuhrman, it is shocking to think that he would still be working on the police force, based on his racially insensitive history. Fuhrman appears on camera in this program, stating that the defense team discovered a "flaw" in his background. But those kinds of flaws affect the outcomes of trials.

From the perspective of prosecutor Marcia Clark, the final jury selection placed her at a disadvantage. But she also indicates on camera that she found the evidence in the case to be exceptionally strong for the prosecution. So what happened to compromise this strong case against O.J. Simpson?

One especially important factor was the selection of the judge, Lance Ito. Early in the trial, the jurors made a field trip to O.J. Simpson's home on Rockingham. By this time, the defense team had cleverly, yet highly unethically, redesigned the home with photos on the walls depicting Simpson with African-Americans. Marcia Clark objected to the tactic, yet Judge Ito inexplicably allowed the jurors into the home to view the photographs. 

And that was only the beginning of circus permitted in the courtroom by Judge Ito. So, racial composition of the jury may not have been as significant as how the case was adjudicated. Why were the jurors even instructed to tour Simpson's home if the crime scene was at Nicole's condo on Bundy Drive? 

Much time was spent by the filmmakers in presenting the standing of defense attorney Johnnie Cochran in the black community of Los Angeles. But a point that is lost in so much emphasis on race is that Cochran was a superb trial lawyer. One only has to listen to excerpts from the prosecution's opening statement to the jury and Cochran's subsequent defense statement to see that Marcia Clark and Chris Darden were outclassed in the courtroom by the skills in argumentation of Johnnie Cochran. 

The combination of Cochran's rhetorical skills, intelligence, and, perhaps most importantly, the genuine emotional impact of his speaking were almost certainly factors that won the acquittal of his client. 

The film's focus on race is interesting and well-presented. But at some point in this series, it should become apparent that race alone is not a sufficient rationale to excuse police and prosecutorial incompetence, as well as the selection of an incompetent judge in the "trial of the century"...especially when the attorney taking center stage is Johnnie Cochran.

None of us can get enough of O.J. Simpson still the trial and the crimes of one icon named O.J. thrill and captivate us. And with this new 5 part documentary "O.J.: Made in America" it's a deep look at the impact of one man who became a legend in white circles only to be black again during his murder trial and then again fall to tragic justice means later on after his not guilty verdict. The whole thing is really a take on white against black and it intersected with the police and the city of L.A..

Done thru 5 different parts it tells of the "Juice's" rise to fame at "USC" thru his record breaking "NFL" life on to fame and stardom as a black man in a white world all while others of race had a tough take with justice. Then the life with Nicole is a lie to O.J. and others as it ends in tragic means and the interviews with ex friends show they now see the light. And the footage is deep and in depth with interviews, media clips and quotes this documentary is like a book of knowledge.

And interviews from the defense team show how the race card was played during the trial to get the "Juice" off and Mark you know who was much to blame in help with this not guilty verdict. The footage is refreshing, heart pounding, and high drama to watch it's like you were living the trial over again.

Clearly this documentary was a take on drama, the call for justice, a showcase for the rise and fall of an icon showing how culture and race relations can mix in with society causing a fraction of believe as O.J. Simpson clearly lived a life of two worlds the first being white then the second being black. Overall this is one documentary to watch you will be informed, educated, entertained and be left seeing the world from two different sides.

A blistering and engrossing documentary about the O.J. Simpson murder trial that explores how the sensational event became a symbol for the racial tension that was just waiting to boil over in Los Angeles in particular and the United States in general.

I was in college when the O.J. story happened, and I only half paid attention to it at the time, so it was fascinating for me to watch this film that seemed like a new version of an old story. The film makes no attempt to hide the filmmakers' opinion that the innocent verdict in the case was a gross miscarriage of justice, but I have to admit that, though I've always believed O.J. was guilty too, I would probably have acquitted him myself as a juror based on the dismal way the prosecution handled the case.

But the grossest outrage about the whole event -- I felt it at the time and I felt it again watching the movie -- is that the murders that made the whole trial necessary in the first place were forgotten amid the racial baiting and the defense's willingness to capitalize on the emotions of an angry and disenfranchised black community. 

A seven-hour documentary may sound daunting at the beginning, but I challenge you not to binge watch it.

Winner of the 2016 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, a complete no brainer of a win.

I wanted to watch Made in America not because of what the show said about OJ, but for what it revealed about American society and how it's changed- or hasn't changed- since the early 1990s. Made in America tells several stories, beginning with the story of how OJ rose from his upbringing in public housing in San Francisco to become a sports star. I wasn't convinced by the show's portrayal of OJ as a legend beloved by the whole country. I was in primary school when he was making his name in football, and I wasn't a sports fan. I heard about the Juice from my older brother. In the early 70s though the big event for us was the Perfect Season Miami Dolphins. I spotted the name Mercury Morris in one of the newspaper articles shown on camera, and I hit pause so I could read it. 

While I grew up in Miami in the 70s and 80s the city had several riots sparked off by police officers being acquitted for shooting and killing African Americans. My parents lived in an affluent suburb and they didn't pay much attention to the race problems, except to advise me not to drive downtown when the problems were happening. I recognised the feelings of anger and frustration expressed by the African American community and the people interviewed for the film. 

I don't know if it was possible for OJ to have a fair trial. I sensed that LAPD and Los Angeles city officials were terrified that a guilty verdict would result in more riots and city wide destruction. While I was watching the footage in the episode about the verdict, I was struck that as the crowds in the streets shouted in joy when they heard OJ had been found not guilty the police horses whinnied in fright and the officers riding them struggled to keep them from bolting. I was shocked to learn that one of the jurors, who raised his hand in a Black Power salute, had been a member of the Black Panthers. Why didn't the prosecution ask for a mistrial? At any rate, OJ's expensive lawyers decided to play the race card from the start. I thought it was despicable, and Made in America's revealing that Simpson had distanced himself from the Civil Rights struggles made me feel it was even more despicable.

Most of all OJ Made in America revealed the fascination that riveted the media in the US to the Simpson trial, and the fascination that the world media had as well. They weren't concerned so much about race-- the trial took place in Los Angeles, and discussed the racism of the LAPD, in the Rodney King case and many others, but above all it was all about Brentwood and Hollywood, celebrity, fame, and money. The People vs OJ Simpson showed that from the very beginning witnesses and people who claimed they they knew the truth were selling their stories to tabloid newspapers and trash TV shows. I wonder if Simpson would have had as much support from the public if he were rich- rich enough to hire big name attorneys- but not a celebrity.

It was the slow chase down the LA freeways that grabbed everybody's attention- here was a celebrity who might blow his brains out on live TV, because he had killed two people - or maybe he was being set up by LAPD because he was black and the victims were white. It was a great show. I don't understand why the prosecution didn't ban cameras from the courtroom like the civil trial did, or why, if they wanted to use cameras, they didn't make them unobtrusive so the people in the courtroom couldn't see them. The trial became the media circus of the century. The last episode, with clips from Simpson's bizarre reality TV show, shows how celebrity and notoriety drive the consciousness of American life. It's significant that Simpson's ultimate downfall took place after an armed robbery to gain control over his memorabilia, which not only has great personal meaning to him, but is worth millions of dollars.

I had to ask myself, why did I watch Made in America? I felt sorry for Nicole - she must have found it difficult to make a life for herself apart from OJ, who not only gave her fame and money, he supported most of her family. I felt sorry for Ron Goldman for being caught up in OJ's rage because he was seen a rival for Nicole's affections, and sorry for Ron's family who saw OJ walk free from a double homicide. I felt empathy for people who felt they had been denied the justice that was given to other Americans (I felt however that the film could have included how other people of other races have been treated by the white majority- there was nothing said about how the Hispanic community felt about how they were treated by the LAPD and the US government) Mostly I was appalled by how Simpson went back to a luxurious life after the trial, selling his autographs for 3 million dollars while in jail, and was still schmoozed by people who wanted a piece of his fame. It's telling that the Goldmans struck back with court orders grabbing Simpson's money, yet Simpson managed to make more sliding into sleaziness in South Miami Beach with coke addict blonde girlfriends. People wanted to keep watching him, keep collecting his signed footballs and t shirts, and keep trying to be associated with him. Made in America holds up a mirror and finds disturbing portraits: not just of OJ, and OJ's actions, but American society's obsession with wealth and fame.

O.J. Simpson was born in unpromising circumstances, but blessed with good looks, charm, and an athletic talent, grew to become one of the most famous men in America: a genius footballer, and an African American who became popular amongst all races, though the latter in part was due to his own willingness to abandon his original racial identity. But his second marriage turned bad, his suave public image increasingly at odds with his brutal treatment of his wife; and eventually, she (and her friend, and probable lover) were murdered. O.J. was on the record as having threatened them, had no alibi, and forensic evidence pointed strongly to his guilt; when the police called him in, he went on the run in a near-suicidal state, and the police followed on the freeway, trying to talk him out of doing himself in. They succeeded in this, only for O.J. to mount an extraordinary defence, in which his lawyers effectively put the Los Angeles Police Department on trial for its long and despicable history of racism. After a trial of months, a mainly black jury took just a few hours to acquit.

But ostracised by the white community in which he'd made his home, O.J. soon lost a civil suit (in a different court, with a lower standard of proof), and motivated (it seems) by his desire for adulation, he fell in with a bad crowd. The new gangsta-style O.J. was perhaps no more the real man than the all-round nice guy or the evil killer; eventually, he threatened (with menaces, and armed friends in tow) someone whom he suspected of stealing his stuff and was finally sentenced to a gaol sentence that was both excessive (in the context of his latest crime) and overdue. He remain in gaol today.

The strength of 'O.J.: Made in America', a marathon documentary that retells this extraordinary story, is that it brings out every facet: his remarkable sporting talent, his plastic personality, the horror of the murders, the grim reality of being poor and black in L.A., the theatre of his arrest and trial, and the sordid nature of his eventual downfall. It's long - possibly overlong - but the title is apt: this is a story that could only have happened in the U.S.A., and it says more about the country than the lurid headlines might have suggested at the time. There's no happy ending for anyone here - but what once seemed like soap opera, now feels strangely like a portrait of a nation, and yes, a dark reflection on the American dream.

If you think this will only be about the death of two white people by the hands of rich and successful black man, you will be in for a rude surprise. 

You are taken on a epic voyage back in time, through the great black southern migration, to the civil rights movement, how people view these epic times. 

How a person can come from an isolated community and be propelled into a new environment they have no prior exposure. 

While the documentary gives you deep exposure to the O.J. Simpson case, some people will say that this documentary will convince you that he committed the horrid murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman - I still have two questions - how did a person kill two people this violently and only have traces of blood on them and no bloody clothes; how in the hell was he able to pull this off within 45 minutes and catch a plane? I have more questions than ever. 

But, the best thing to do before you watch this documentary. Sit down, relax, open you eyes, let your curiosity take hold and go where the filmmakers take you.

O.J.: Made in America is the Oscar winner for best documentary in 2016 and its well deserved. What a documentary. There is so much detail in this and so many questions answered that we didn't know would or could be answered about the infamous O.J Simpson case.

I'm normally not a documentary type-guy but this had me floored. It's such an amazing piece of artistry, and being a young European I hadn't actually heard of this case before which meant that I was amazed all the way through.

I first watched the dramatization of the story in The People v. O.J Simpson: American Crime story and honestly it just made this documentary even better as they're not acting. These events has ACTUALLY happened.

Some may argue that it's very long for a documentary (7hr 47 min), but honestly the backstory which we get in the first couple of episodes is time well spent. It makes the impact of the final chapters of this story so much larger and makes for a more emotional ending.

What made me love this story and documentary so much is that it has made me think so much about this case. I've finished the documentary a week ago and I'm STILL thinking about this documentary. That's how good it is.

Wow, what a story and what an ending. Incredible. I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone who loves film and who loves definitive stories. However, I think the documentary will have the biggest impact on you if you haven't heard much about the story and aren't fully aware of everything that happened to O.J Simpson. That being said you will still have an amazing time watching this documentary regardless if you know about the origins of this case or not.

The first part of the three part documentary looks at the rise of a successful black African American in a world of predominately white orientation. It is aptly named "made in America" on account of it being a rags to riches to rags story. 

In the second part the public reaction to the high profile trial is documented which according to the narrative shows the justice sought by the black community in Los Angeles at the time had less to do with evidence given in court than it did with a historic sense of grievance. The narrative then presents the trial as an opportunity for the black community to redress this historic issue of racial iniquity by supporting the defendant. The notion that the issue of racism is more significant than justice for the two victims is one supported by the juror's themselves which effectively negates the possibility of a fair trial. Its all about race.

In the third instalment following OJ's acquittal there is a peculiar moment where a female radio host begrudgingly admits OJ's charm and beguiling manner are affable qualities as though it is some kind of guilty pleasure to do so. There seems to be a tangible dualism that is encapsulated, on one hand a fragile sense of fraternity and on the other maintaining reservations about his innocence and past. The uneasy dichotomy between respectability and criminality remains until the trajectory towards further criminal behaviour develops in Nevada. There are parallels with the darkly humorous TV series Eastbound and Down that in this case culminate in an armed robbery that proves to be the final straw in OJ's relationship with the general public.

Nearly 8hours is a big time investment, but absolutely worth! The thoroughness of this work to me was both a big positive as a little negative. Positive in the way you get to know so much about the issue through such a big scope and negative mainly because of the repetitiveness of interview-scene-interview-scene etc. Depending on how much you know and how much more you would like to know about O.J. Simpson you might find this both interesting and tiring at times. The whole thing is packed with very interesting and personal background information and interviews to me all seemed relevant. I watched the whole thing over the course of 2-3 weeks and found it works out pretty well.

Three overlapping themes are combined 1. The character OJ Simpson 2. History of race gap & role of the LAPD 3. reactions and influence of the public. Throughout the course of Made in America they combined in a way that showed the complexity of it all from different angles. The events are displayed chronologically and the three themes mentioned above neatly work together with the passing of events where focus on different themes change from time to time. 

Overall definitely glad I checked this out, if you are still considering your time investment in this one I would say go for it  but make sure you really want to because you are in for a long one. It is really unique and outstanding, I don't think you'll regret it.
