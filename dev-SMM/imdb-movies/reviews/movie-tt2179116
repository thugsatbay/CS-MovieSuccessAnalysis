Toy's House was an interesting film following what most teenage kids wish...A kid who finally breaks free from his parents control. Joe Toy and his friend Patrick get fed up with their parents and decide to build a house in the woods to live in.

I really enjoyed this movie. It seemed to have the right mix of comedy and drama to keep you engaged the whole movie. Watching a couple of teenage boys try and survive in the woods was a lot of fun, and Nick Offerman as Joe's dad was a lot of fun as well. The biggest thing to note, is that while this is billed as a comedy, it was definitely more than that. The emotional aspect of this movie was everything you come to expect from a movie that has to sale itself with a great story, like most films at Sundance, which made it all that more fun.

"The Kings of Summer" is a film you need to accept on its own terms. It's not a Hollywood production, it has a relatively low budget and it has a few plot problems. Sure, the characters might not be 100% believable or even really that likable--but, if you sit back and watch it with modest expectations, you'll find the good easily outweighs the bad.

The film is about two disaffected teens. Both hate it at home and they want to get out...but how? When one comes up with an insane plan to move into the woods and build their own shack, the other, reluctantly comes along for the plan. There is a third--and that kid, Biaggio, is a real cipher. He's bizarre and in the film mostly for comic relief--though I found myself liking him the best of the three. But when he disappears, no one seems to notice...he's that sort of a kid. But the two main characters are initially happy and their running away seems to be working out well...at least for a time.

Overall, this is a film that folks who only enjoy traditional movies will probably NOT like very much. As for me, I have a higher than normal tolerance for the unusual and found a lot of nice performances and moments in the film. Worth seeing and clever.

Debut feature director Jordan Vogt-Roberts' Kings of Summer (née Toy's House) is a coming of age story of 2 best friends who decide to build a house in the woods to escape their families and their enigmatic friend Biaggio who accompanies them. 

The three kids give great performances and all seem so natural in their characters; Moises Arias is exceptionally funny as the oddball Biaggio. I caught the third ever showing at Sundance London followed by a director's Q&A and he remarked that many moments are just the kid's messing around and sometimes unaware they are being filmed. The montage scene of the kids playing in the woods and banging on the pipe that opens the film was filmed all in one day with just the kids, the D.P and director and is so naturally the sort of nonsense a group of teenagers would get up to. 

An amazing supporting cast including the always wonderful Nick Offerman, Alison Brie, Megan Mullally and Mary Lynn Rajskub perfectly deliver the material; it's an impressive cast for such a small film.

Début writer Chris Galletta delivered a cracking script that delivers on the laughs and also has some strong emotional moments as the boys inevitably fallout over a girl and we see the kid's fractious relationship with their parents. 

A great mix of classic coming of age tales such as Stand By Me and the indie comedies of recent times that hits the comedic and dramatic notes without ever being saccharine, annoyingly quirky or overly morbid as so many indie comedies fall into. 

I highly recommend the film; it will transport you back to your terrible but wonderful teenage years and is genuinely hilarious, I can't imagine a single person not loving this film.

Three unhappy teenagers run away from the sophisticated city life and take refuge in nature, where they plan to build a makeshift home and live off the land, to finally be masters of their own destiny. Once you arrive at your destination, you make it reality, however, realize that the wild is much tougher as the imagined.

Biaggio (Moises Arias), the very rare embodiment of social awkwardness and complete and total lack of personal sophistication teenager, that invokes a combination of amazement, bewilderment, and pity simultaneously from the common viewer. It's a role that cannot be explained...only watched. He is quite possibly one of the best comedic performances I have ever seen a young performer give. It's a wonderfully bizarre role that fully encompasses both the awkwardness and the sincerity of a social misfit. The role is so over-the-top that it's amazing that Arias can make it look so natural and genuine. His acting was spot on and absolutely hilarious. Loved it!

'The Kings of Summer' was a nice coming-of-age film about 3 teenage boys who want independence so decide to build a house in the woods away from the real world.

I really like the plot and the actors all done a very good job. The 3 boys were believable and extremely likable. The supporting cast were also very good. The house they build looks brilliant. The story is a lot about friendship which is really nice. There was some moments that made you smile but it wasn't overly funny, I would class it as more of a drama film.

Overall it was an enjoyable film, a really meaningful story which is easy to relate to. Definitely worth a watch if you want something to cheer you up.

7.5/10.

"Why live when you can rule."

There have been several coming of age films that have been released over the years, but very few have actually stuck with me. The Kings of Summer is one of those few movies that appealed to me and had me emotionally involved with the characters. First time director Jordan Vogt- Roberts takes us through a range of emotions from nostalgic and heart breaking moments to laugh out loud buddy moments. It lives up to the standard of other great coming of age tales like Stand By Me. There is something about a group of young teens exploring the woods and their transition to adulthood that simply appeals to me. The scenery was also breathtaking and I absolutely fell in love with those woods. I could see what was so appealing for these kids and their need to feel independent. It does have that sort of familiar indie vibe to it, but thanks to some great performances the movie stands out above most of them. Moises Arias had me laughing throughout the entire movie playing this quirky character that reminded me a lot of Fogell in Superbad. His comedic timing was perfect and he had the funniest lines in the film. The screenplay by first timer Chris Galletta was also really well developed. I will be looking forward to his next work because his script made it easy to go through such different ranges of emotions. This film felt like a simple sweet feel good movie and it is one that I would recommend to my friends especially if they love the woods.

Joe (Nick Robinson) has just finished his freshman year in High School and isn't looking forward to spending his Summer with his widowed father Frank (Neil Offerman) who makes his life miserable just because he's miserable. His best friend Patrick (Gabriel Basso) doesn't enjoy living with his parents any better. His parents (played by Marc Evan Jackson and Megan Mullally) are over protective and seem to want to manage every single detail of his life. Not wanting to spend their entire summers abiding by their parents rules the two kids decide to run away and build their own home in the nearby woods and survive in the wild by hunting and gathering food. This way they can be free to do what they want and make their own rules. Joe and Patrick also bring along a strange friend named Biaggio (Moises Arias). The three seem to be having the time of their lives without anyone telling them what to do and having guests over whenever they want to until a girl named Kelly (Erin Moriarty) gets in the way of their friendship and disrupts the balance of their kingdom.

The Kings of Summer works thanks to some great performances from the trio of friends who bring a sense of nostalgia to the viewers' senses simply by playing and running around in the woods with swords and sticks. Those unscripted moments in which the kids simply goof around with one another are the best. Arias is really hilarious and he seems to steal every scene here. Robinson also gives a strange performance in the lead role. The film is easy going with likable characters and some wonderful cinematography. It is just great to look at and it completely surprised me at times with some of the turns the story took. It wasn't one of those predictable coming of age films and I really had a fun time. I wouldn't be surprised if The Kings of Summer ends up in many peoples' top 10 list at the end of the year because it is a crowd pleaser.

First off, I'd like to say that this is my first ever movie review. I'd been prolonging until I find a non-blockbuster movie that can really caught me deeply and The Kings of Summer happened to be the one.

The acting in this movie is basically original, starring Nick Robinson who played Joe perfectly well as a fifteen year-old desperately wanting to get out of his dad's house under his rules just like a typical teenager. Then there's his best friend, Gabriel Basso who played as Patrick who loves his parents but also desperately wanting to get out of their house because of how their parents treat him as a child. Moises Arias as Biaggio, who I think really suits for the role of a physically small friend of both of them who appeared out of nowhere and could really get things funny because he's that lovable and warm. Joe's dad, Nick Offerman as Frank, played a great grumpy father who gets mad and cranky easily in this movie and then there's Erin Moriarty as Kelly, which plays the girl who Joe had a crush on. 

The movie at first started just like any ordinary drama movie, but the various shots and angles made it look pretty smart in the beginning. As you watch longer, the movie started getting interesting to where it's going, although you can really guess what will happen next. The Kings of Summer with its "Into The Wild" theme is packed with humor and a bunch of emotional feeling will be involved throughout the movie. Another plus point for this movie is the selection of songs in the background or soundtracks, how each song suits perfectly well based on the actions the characters were doing which really built up my point of view towards the movie. 

What caught me the most is how the movie is directed and made it as if he really wants us to feel to be like each one of the character involved there. The shots on the scenery and "wild" views in the forest really succeeded on making me re-think and went deeper about how there's more to the movie than what I've actually seen. The movie does have some really cliché teenager scenes, however, I like how it stays original and remain unpretentious by showing that there's a big chance that conflicts may happen between friends and families but then in the end you will always come back to them, by not having all the cheesy fights nor a corny truce. It sticks to reality and shows people that it is truly what it is.

Not considering how old you are, I really recommend you to watch this movie with anyone for you're about to feel that youth blood pumping down your streams and actually get something out of it. Praise for Jordan Vogt-Roberts for making this movie as perfect, my eyes were glistening right at the very last scene of the movie and at the same time drawing a smile on my face.

"We do swear, under pain of friendship lost, to never speak of this enterprise to any adults; to never betray its location or its participants." Joe (Robinson) and Patrick (Basso) both hate their lives at home. Living with over bearing parents are making them crazy and when they are pushed too far they decide to move out. The find a place in the middle of the woods and build their own house. The two of them along with a young boy who they are afraid to tell to go away start off on a experience that effects each one differently. This is an example of a movie where the trailer doesn't do the movie justice. This is an excellent and must see movie for all teenagers for a few reasons. One is because it shows that their parents aren't as bad as they seem compared to these. I could go on and on about this but the best way to describe this is a Stand By Me for a new generation. This is is movie that just needs to be seen rather then read about. Also the kid that plays Biaggio really steals the movie and is so much fun to watch. Overall, a must see for young teens and parents. I highly recommend. I easily give it an A.

If you are looking for a heart-filled independent film, then this is the right choice for you. This film has a lot of heart put into it, which makes its characters more likable, interesting, and funny. The humor has this old-fashioned vibe to it, making this film great for adults (props to the soundtrack for some awesome retro-gaming like music) Now, do I think the humor stands out as much as the story? Not really, but that's not a bad thing. A comedy's story is usually very weak so that only makes this comedy stronger. Also, the likable cast also leads to some great humor. You want to see these kids succeed in building their own home in the forest and its very enjoyable to watch. A great cast (Moises Arias as an oddball weirdo was an awesomely funny choice), good humor, and a great heart is what a comedy should be made of. The Kings of Summer definitely rules.

The concept of this story has merit, however the execution is well off the mark in all respects. 

The story progression seems extremely rushed, partly due to the amount of unnecessary scenes and dialogue that have been afforded to cameo characters at various points. Some of the dialogue has comedic value, but for the most it's just basic.

I think more time needed to be given to develop the main characters and to develop the plot, rather than to random scenes which hold no real relevance to either. 

The cosmetics which help keep everything believable were ignored in some respects. Simple things, like how do they store their shop bought chickens without refrigeration, where did they pull architect designs for their house from, why were there fireworks going off in the middle of the bush at night in the swimming scenes, was it necessary for the almost pre-pubescent boys to sprout obviously fake beards and random violin playing in the middle of the forest? 

Oh and for those who compared this to Stand by me. Stand by me is far, far, far better than this movie.

I watched a trailer for this film that provided me with absolutely no information. Three boys making very average music by hitting a pipe with tree branches while one of them danced in the background. Somehow this grabbed my attention and I came to IMDb for more information. With nothing other than a completely uninformative teaser and a small synopsis, I grabbed the movie and watched it with a group of guys in my horrible little apartment lounge room.

Then we literally grabbed more people and all watched it again the next day.

Kings of Summer is successful in what I believe is it's ambition - It is different to any other coming of age film that has been around in a long time. It sets aside the need for the melancholy undertone and doesn't take itself too seriously. You know who this reminds me of? Most boys in their teens and early twenty-somethings, which is easily the target audience for this movie.

Even the mention of Toy's mother dying didn't need a massive heart-wrenching scene. It was kept simple. They didn't want to much emotion or deep feelings to come out. Because this is really the theme of the story. Becoming a man.

Kings of Summer is consistently funny when it needs to be, and both memorable and quotable. And a bonus for me, I got both Ron Swanson and Buster. I would recommend this movie to any mate who hasn't seen it.

I really like coming of age films. Being a young adult at the time or writing this review, I can relate to them. It talks about growing up and how it can be tough. But sadly, this film was a mess for me. 

At times, it tries to be a comedy, but feels kind of awkward. It almost comes across as a movie that could have been PG rated or even a kids movie, but throws in the F-bomb every now and then. The humour sometimes worked, because I had a few laughs, but it mostly came across as boring and stale. Other times the movie tries to be serious. There's a situation at the end that tries to be dramatic, but because of the weird tone of the film, I just don't feel it. It also includes moments that almost feel like it's trying to be an artsy independent film, or even a Terrence Malick film, because there's scenes where we see wildlife and people walking in fields. None of this works for me. 

The performances by the kids were... interesting. The two main kids are good, but the one weird Italian kid did not work. He was trying to be comedic relief but he was an unoriginal stupid character. Nick Offerman plays one of the characters fathers, and honestly, I don't completely understand his appeal. He always plays the sarcastic guy, and it sometimes works in other films and even this one, but it just doesn't allow you to connect to his character, which I feel the film wanted you to do.

I really wanted this to be good, because it seemed interesting, but in the end it felt like a weird and cheesy kids movie that happens to have some swearing. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe if I rewatched it another time, it might click, but I just didn't get that this time around.

The Kings of Summer is exactly what you expect from it. To think anything more would be to have unreasonable expectations. Sometimes a movie fulfils exactly what you expect from it without exceeding them. The film absolutely has a Stand By Me feel to it but with a more modern twist. I feel like older teenagers and even adults will connect with the boys in this film and how they see their parents. Both sets of parents are obnoxious and overbearing but somehow I felt like perhaps we were seeing their flaws more so through the eyes of the boys so their personalities were personified. Still each character has their own flaws to overcome and obstacles to deal with. I think perhaps the only thing the film was missing was a lot more heart or emotion. I expected to feel something a little more but in the aspect it felt a little dry at times in particular with at least one of the performances. There was a fair bit of bad language making this mostly for much older teenagers or adults but anyone looking for a good solid drama with a distinctive style and art house quality will enjoy this.

Nick Robinson, whom I know well from his stint on Melissa and Joey (don't ask), leads this cast very well. He actually is a character that does show emotion and makes the teen angst very believable. He has the perfect tone for the film and plays the comedy well against the drama. Gabriel Basso is his best friend and he is decent in the role. I didn't feel like their chemistry was terrific but it was okay. Basso was good but far from great and seem to be unsure of where to take his character in certain scenes. Moises Arias is probably the one that a lot of people will be quoting and talking about from the film. He is the awkward and socially inept Biaggio and he is very funny. His character stands out as being more over the top but he does it very well. I think they overplay his comedic moments but he does get some solid emotional scenes in the end which was good. I felt like Robinson's chemistry with Arias was better than with Basso. I know a lot of people really enjoy Nick Offerman as a comedian and I am not familiar with him but I thought he sort of missed the mark as Robinson's father who has a lot of personal issues going on. I thought he was too dry in the role and just lacked any personality at all which didn't help things. Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson were perfectly ridiculous as Basso's parents. You would think it would be too much but somehow you will see something of your own parents in them. Their roles were small but appropriately used and I enjoyed them a lot. Erin Moriarity is the obligatory first love of Robinson's life. She is the object of his fascination and heart beating. She is good in the role and their chemistry good and it is an absolutely integral part of a coming of age story but I thought she was sadly underused.

Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts hasn't got a lot of credits to his name and I hate to say it but his inexperience shows. A more talented director would have put a lot more heart into this story. Still for a new director he has some beautiful shots and a distinctive style that I enjoyed. He tells a solid story and while I thought the ending was a little cut and dry...it really was the inevitable ending. There wasn't much else for it do than what it did. First time film writer Chris Galletta crafts a good story, if not very stereotypical and the film is all around pretty safe. It doesn't push any boundaries and is mostly just a sweet coming of age story. It was good, not more and not less. 7/10

I love coming of age movies and I love to laugh. In my 17 years I have never seen a movie that has appealed to me so entirely. You can't go into this expecting anything too serious, I think that is the issue that most negative reviewers had. While there are some significant themes here, Kings of Summer is not The Shawshank Redemption. This is not because it fails as a movie, but because it does not try to be anything more than what it is. This is a film that is meant to be a humorous look into the lives of a couple of teenagers. I think there is a tendency among many "movie-nuts" to believe that the only good movies are those that depress you or involve some very dark themes. I guess what I am saying is to go in with an open mind, and just enjoy yourself. Anyone who doesn't feel a bit better leaving this movie than when entering it is obviously trying too hard to be critical. Let go, have a laugh, join the three Kings of Summer.

Once again, we return to the topic of growing up, and being on the verge of adulthood. A longing for rebellion and freedom is something which always comes up in these films, most notably in "The Breakfast Club", and that desire is something which every viewer above a certain age can relate to. "The Kings of Summer" shows us in an enduring and funny way how three teenagers try to become adults, with mixed results. It's a superb indie comedy, with heartfelt performances and beautiful cinematography.

The film tells the story of Joe Toy, a teenager who is so fed up with his home life that he decides to build a house in the forest with some friends and run away from home. They set rules for the house, such as having to kill and cook their own food (a rule which is very quickly broken), and start off by simply enjoying their newfound freedom. It doesn't last long, however, as the teens very quickly fall out because of a girl who Joe likes, but who ends up beginning a relationship with his best friend Patrick. Eventually Joe ends up living in the forest alone, allowing his character to develop in a number of interesting ways.

What makes "The Kings of Summer" so enjoyable is the extremely sharp and witty script, written by first-time writer Chris Galletta, and a set of absolutely superb performances. Nick Offerman is as funny and cutting as always, and the relationship which he builds with his rebelling son is very heartwarming. Even though it seems that Joe's dad, Frank, doesn't care for what he wants, the search which Frank undergoes to get him back is a clear symbol of that love, and Offerman shows this importance extremely well. However it is Nick Robinson, who plays Joe, who really stands out with his ability to mix comedy and heartfelt emotion. When Joe's heart is broken, we feel his pain and understand his following actions. The film's ending is so well managed that it tugs all of the necessary heartstrings.

In "The Kings of Summer", Jordan Vogt-Roberts, with his first feature film, masterfully captures the emotions of growing up and pairs them with the beautiful forest landscape which the teens inhabit. In some ways, it is possible to compare this with another coming-of-age film from 2013, "The Way Way Back". Both deal with protagonists who are fed up with family life and find an escape, and both deal with the topic extremely well. It is a warm and constantly enjoyable indie film, which is worth watching if just to take you back to your youth.

As a avid movie watcher I can honestly say this movie was the most accurate, heartwarming, and amazing tale of what being a teenager is like. I can say without a doubt every teenager in the world could relate to Joe and Patrick. Who hasn't been forced to the brink of annoyance by their (once thought to be) terrible parents? Who hasn't dreamed of running away? and who has not shared an incredible summer with friends, who are more like family? I came across this movie online and I don't know why it hasn't gotten more attention. This is my favorite film and I plan on watching it again. Its a mystery to me why the film is rated R. No nudity, no sexual content, it swears less than my uncle. Joe is my hero. I wish I could know him and his brothers personally. They truly are the kings of summer and I look forward to living under their legacy.

The Kings of Summer falls along the lines of films like Say Anything and Stand By Me. It's one of those movies where you are left with a smile on your face and with the realization that what you just witnessed was an excellent work of art. I was intrigued and impressed with each moment of the film. Something that specifically stood out to me was the cinematography and the overall beautiful scenery within the film. It takes you upon an emotionally roller coaster while testing the relationship between families and friends. Moises Arias portrays the hilarious little friend in a new, exciting way. Such a character like his would tend to be over-acted or seem fake, but he did not have this problem. Nick Robinson played the lead role in a captivating way and I can imagine this is just a taste of the success that he is about to receive. Nevertheless, The Kings of Summer left me wanting to re-watch the film over and over again and could easily be considered this generation's John Hughes and Cameron Crowe type film. I would recommend this to not just teenagers, but adults alikeso go watch. Kudos to the director and writers.

This is the kind of movie I wish made all the box office money, because it so successfully brought so many kinds of talent to the screen. The script was a delight because just when you felt it falling into familiar cliché territory, you are whip-lashed into a one liner like Biaggio's "I said I don't know how to cry".... I can't give any more of that without spoiling, but it stopped me cold, it was hilarious. The script is filled with those bon mots, as well as just about every single line that came out of Nick Offerman's mouth. His part was deadly comical. The scenes of when the boys are in the woods as the house comes up are fantastic in the production and photography, especially the 'drumming' scene which was fantastic. I was familiar with Arias and Robinson from their TV work and they shine here given room to stretch, but Basso holds his own also. The best thing about the movie is how it segues between funny and sad without telegraphing, and how dark and intense it gets when it was so light hearted just a moment before. Definitely a re-playable offering.

You know I wasn't expecting too much and maybe that's why I thoroughly enjoyed this. It was a breath of fresh air, feel good at times certainly and also quite predictable, but if it's done well as this was, then that shouldn't matter. Some great caricatures played wonderfully by an excellent cast, right down to the food delivery man put it way above what you might expect to be just another "teen movie". It is often likened to "Stand by me" but is really far more on a par the British film Submarine, albeit lighter.

Above all it was nicely quirky, which I guess is what most appealed to me. Recommended; especially on a cold dank and dreary Novembers day.

The movie stars Allison Brie, who we know from Mad Men as well as Community; Gabriel Basso, who you may know from The Big C; and Ron Swanson, whose real name is Nick Offerman. Also, Offerman's wife Megan Mullally, from Will and Grace, is in the film.

Now, being that this is a coming-of-age film, the characters are mostly teens with the usual screwed up parents. To start off, we have Joe (played by Nick Robinson) who is our lead and, like all leads in coming- of-age tales, he has some issues. Starting off, his mom is dead and the man/dad he lives with, played by Nick Offerman, pretty much is a butt hole. He also has a sister, Heather, played by Allison Brie who does feel for him a bit, but isn't in a position to help him relocate. So, in order to cope, outside of randomly calling the cops sometimes on his dad, Joe hangs out with Patrick (played by Gabriel Basso) who seems like a nice everyday kid, with a never fully explained foot injury. Patrick's parents, played by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Johnson, are of the overbearing sort. However, they are so corny that they seem like cut characters from Suburgatory. The last main character to mention is Moises Arias' character, who plays a typical weird foreign kid. It feels like a slightly different character from the one you may know him from on Hannah Montana, but at the same time he still plays a weird kid who seems to be playing up a stereotype for laughs. So, needless to say, this shouldn't be considered a breakout role.

Focusing on the story, The Kings of Summer starts off like a run of the mill coming-of-age story. However, as the story goes on you get a sense that the movie isn't really trying to take itself too seriously. The reason I say that is because it relies on characters which don't try to beg for sympathy, like most coming of age films, and take the roles Offerman, Mullaly and Johnson play. Each of them play the parents and at times you are lead to believe they are more spoofing, or mocking, coming-of-age parents than trying to give a realistic performance. And this isn't to say the movie doesn't try to take on a serious tone, but even when it tries to make things a bit more serious by having Joe, Patrick and Arias' Biaggio leaving home and live in the woods, it never really leaves the silliness behind. For one, the parents don't really take the situation seriously since Offerman's character remains a bit of a douche, and Joe's parents pretty much act like "gee wilikers are kid is gone." Secondly, outside some teen drama dealing with a girl, there aren't many issues for the boys. Altogether, while the film avoids becoming pretensions or mimicking what we saw in The Way, Way Back or The Spectacular Now, it also avoids moving you or making you feel interested in the characters.

But, in a way, the appeal of this movie is at least it tries to break the cycle. Most coming-of-age films try to be deep, dramatic and only tap on realistic comedic moments, which usually deal with being awkward, to lighten things up. For The Kings of Summer however, just take all the issues which seem to give weight to most films of this genre, and let that be handled by other films. Now, this isn't to say the characters don't have issues, but the film more so is about the act of rebelling than growing up and having a drastic life change be shown in an hour and a half.

However, while you have to praise it for trying to be different, it at the same times sort of fails at it. While watching, you can see it tries to be a dramedy, but the jokes are more miss than hit and while characters are defined, you don't really get a sense that they develop. The Joe you meet in the beginning, after approximately 4 weeks, doesn't seem much different from the Joe we see at the end. Yeah, he has learned the value of friendship, both with best friend Patrick, Biaggio, and love interest Kelly (played by Erin Moriarty), but you don't really see him as evolving that much. At best, perhaps him and his father learn to deal with, and joke about, what aggravating qualities the other one has, but it doesn't feel like there is any real payoff. And it doesn't just go for Joe, but Patrick as well, if not more so. You don't see Patrick understand or appreciating his overbearing parents, he just basically gets tired of Joe's BS and then goes back to his parents like nothing happened. In many ways, as entertaining as the film is in some scenes, it is hurt due to it not being serious enough to be considered a drama, not being funny enough to be a comedy, and the film's attempt to balance both makes it look like an amateur on a tightrope swaying wildly.

Overall: TV Movie

Unfortunately, The Kings of Summer suffers from lack of character development and weakly trying to mix fantasy elements, like building a decent shanty house in a few days, with the usual coming of age drama in such a way which doesn't mesh well. Still, it has its moments where it is funny and when the characters are interesting, but as it tries to stand out in the coming of age drama genre, it doesn't set a positive precedent for other films which may try a lighter approach. So, overall, I can only recommend this as a movie you watch whenever it comes on TV.

There's not a lot I can say about this movie just that it is a MASTERPIECE. This is a movie that once watched is hard to stop watching, mainly because of the pure genius that was produced. The movie can resemble typical teenager's life that wants to spend time with their friends, being independent and mainly rule at the same time. The movie includes comedy, adventure and drama all rolled into one.

Jordan Vogt-Roberts was a first time director when making this movie and what a way to kick of his career with a movie like The Kings of Summer. He got the characters spot on in this movie and choose the perfect actors to play the characters; the three main characters are Joe Toy (Nick Robinson), Patrick Keenan (Gabriel Basso) and Biaggio (Moises Arias). He didn't just get the characters/actors spot on he got the set of where they were filming in the woods perfectly and makes me especially want to build my own house there.

Joe has just finished his freshman year in high school and is about to spend his summer with his father Frank Toy (Nick Offerman). Frank makes Joe's life a misery and Joe dislikes him this plays a main part in Joe's run away. Joe's best friend Patrick lives with his mum and dad (played by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson) Patrick seriously dislikes living with his parents mainly because they control every bit of his life by being overprotective. Not wanting to be controlled by their parents both of them decide to run off into the woods and build their own house gather the food themselves and follow their own rules without know one knowing especially their parents. It wasn't just them two though that ran away from home their strange friend Biaggio also comes along not knowing why he ran off. Wanting company the three decide to have a house warming dinner with Kelly (Erin Moriarty) and a couple other friends as well. Joe deeply loves Kelly but she doesn't feel the same way as him.

The Kings of Summer makes a great movie due to the great acting and the storyline. I highly recommend watching this as it will be a movie you wouldn't think twice of watching it again.

it's like a much snarkier version of stand by me crossed with walden pond.

it's a hilarious and deeply genuine portrayal of then emotions that adolescence brings on and has characters you really end up liking.

the writing is excellent, the direction wonderful, and the story flows well.

biaggio is sidesplitting and frank is hilarious. all the kids are great.

in a year of poorly conceived and overblown thrillers, this is a movie more in the vein of moonrise kingdom, but much better. it's funnier, better paced, and ultimately more engaging.

this one is an amazing movie debut for roberts and i look forward to seeing more from him.

Movies like Into the Wild , 127 hours , The Motorcycle Diaries are based on living your life with full freedom. When you are caged in a house or walking down in somebody's shoes, an aggression will come over you and a force will drive you to explore a place to find peace.

Kings of Summer tells the story of 3 teenagers who are pressurized, dominated and caged by their family. During summer, they decide to build a house and create their own set of rules allowing them to live completely in freedom.

As first time director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts does a fine job in choosing a run-of-mill story and explore the beauty of nature. However it is the weak screenplay and story writing that serves no purpose to watch the film. True the film begins with a positive notes but ends on a shaky ground confusing with any particular message in the end. The camera work is the highlight of the film and genre of the film falls from being a comedy into serious drama. Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso and Moises Arias were outstanding and astonishing playing their part with conviction. Background score gels well with the movement of the film.

Overall, Kings of Summer was a nice try. It had excellent cinematography , few fun-filled moments but weak screenplay and story-line makes strictly one-time watch. Decent 2.5/5

The coming-of-age subgenre is one well-trodden. But it's one that deserves to be constantly updated through the generations and moving technology though it's hard not to be repetitive. Fortunately, they can bend to any genre and any style which means there's always that perfect one you can connect to. Although I haven't seen it just yet, this year's The Way Way Back seems intended as mainstream nostalgia whereas The Kings of Summer is definitely in the contemporary indie vein though it seems to want it in all the styles and all the genres. It's ambitious to have a script that wants to be part comedy, part serious and part comic. But it never decides if it wants to be realistic or surrealistic and it really hurts the flow of the film. I quite liked its ideas on paper, however basic they were, but in execution, it falls short. It's not because it's without energy, in fact, it's full to the brim, but it's so overdone and forward that it hasn't earned it. Characters simply aren't well developed enough before the story kicks off.

It seems quirky for the sake of quirky, serious for the sake of seriousness. It's like Moonrise Kingdom plus Into the Wild. While there's a realistic atmosphere, some of the aspects just aren't convincing, such as the core one of the kids building a house themselves. The severe factor that isn't convincing are the motivations. It's not enough. However, its emotion and comedy do work, but only in shards and that's due to the style. Nick Offerman is absolutely brilliant as the miserable father and he's the most consistent bright spark. Great to see him have more than a bit-role in a film. The photography is the highlight, perhaps the thing they thought about the most, almost like an instagrammed version of Mud, and it has some 'how did they do that?' shots. But I wish the editing didn't chop it up so much, the whole film feels like highlights rather than the whole story. The Kings of Summer is a mixed bag, but mostly enjoyable. A lot of focus and decisiveness could've helped it by the bucketful.

7/10

"Why live when you can rule?" The tagline gives little away but says everything about The Kings of Summer.

I knew very little about Jordan Vogt-Roberts' feature debut other than what Mark Kermode had reported (and then revisited). I deliberately looked no further than the trailer and sought it out for myself.

As Kermode and others have stated, The Kings of Summer owes a great deal to Stand By Me, Rob Reiner's sensitive adaptation of Stephen King's beautiful, coming of age novella. In common with the latter, The Kings of Summer has a small group of boys on their own journey of discovery through love, friendship and family angst. But there is so much more to it, and that isn't to criticize Stand By Me in any way. But if Reiner's film holds a place in your heart, take the plunge.

Joe Troy (Nick Robinson) is closing in on adolescence and struggling with life under the glare of his cold, overbearing father, Frank (Nick Offerman), who himself is battling his own daemons and struggles to show affection. Joe finds a secluded clearing in the woods and persuades his best friend, Patrick (Gabriel Basso), to join him in his escape from their constrictive world, and there, joined by oddball Biaggio (Moises Arias) they build a 'house' and declare themselves masters of their own destinies.

And that's pretty much it. The Kings of Summer isn't a film of epic discoveries, great mystery and explosions; the discoveries are about themselves, the mystery is life itself and the explosions are the fireworks of their own emotions. But you know what? The Kings of Summer is real, it is natural, it's beautiful and it's a near perfect film.

Chris Galletta's debut screenplay flows easily; there are no self-conscious soliloquies but frequent silences where Vogt-Roberts allows the images to tell us everything we need to know. There is context, of course, but frequently scenes just happen. What we see are three boys escaping, running, leaping, drumming and being one with each other and their world without need for explanation but an innate understanding of each other's situations. Like Son of Rambow, we are guests in their world. It is a reminder, both joyful and painful, of all that we once enjoyed and endured and a contemplative look at what we could have achieved if only we'd had the balls to take matters into our own hands.

The central trinity is a flawless blend of characteristics to which we can all identify. It could easily be just one body inhabited by three souls who meld or clash according to the situation. Like Stand By Me, the three principals give the impression of being life-long friends rather than actors cast for our entertainment. Theirs is a relationship that echoes with those of our own childhoods (and hopefully adult life, if we're fortunate) and it works so beautifully upon the screen because it feels natural and effortless. Often critics talk of 'chemistry' in terms of romantic leads but in The Kings of Summer it is a flawless harmony, even when they are sparring with one another.

Robinson gives Nick a wistful willfulness that has us gunning for him. We want him to find his own way through this difficult childhood and achieve what we could not. There is a warm sincerity to his performance; his anger is entirely understandable and we want to be in his space in his time so that he can be our friend.

Likewise, Basso brings our own reservations and fears to the party and it's impossible not to admire him but still want to shake him to loosen him up a little.

Arias is in a different league, though. He is an absolute joy to watch and so much of the laughter is induced simply by his presence. His quirky, off-beat Biaggio is possibly the most delightful character to grace the screen this year so far. Arias blends Biaggio's idiosyncrasies masterfully, leaving us to wonder if he is there by design and fully aware or just bumbling along in his unique manner without plan or complete understanding.

The Kings of Summer will be lost on those seeking movie stars and action but it is a gently funny, beautifully honed film that is almost certain to rank in my top ten for the year. To hell with being young, I'm going out to have more adventures and build camps in the woods right now! Anyone up for joining me?
