### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews here. But then I remember, this is IMDb. Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman's story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it "exciting." Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or "training." Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you've ever been in the area. On foot. I happily gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.

This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but not bad at all and worth watching. Well done! This could be called a chick flick for real women who want substance, Strength and encouragement from the female in the role. When the world gets to much and is sucking your life away- Get the heck out and walk, climb a mountain , ride a horse ! Push the boundaries of what you think you are capable of and learn! I cried , it was good. I didn't know anything about it until I watched it. I have been coming to IMDb to pick movies with good ratings and people giving good reviews. Only to be disappointed time and again. If you like the Idea of the film , you will likely enjoy it as much as I did.

A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother's (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven't been this impressed by her as an actress since "Election" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in "Walk the Line"). And it's nice to see Laura Dern again, who's popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie's editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character's hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.

One of the minor miracles of "Wild" is how subtly it explores not just the trials and dangers one would encounter in such a hike, but specifically how those trials and dangers are heightened, or at least are of a different nature, for a woman. Only once in the film is it overtly addressed, but before that scene late in the film, the director and Witherspoon have already conveyed without words how perilous such an adventure could be for a young woman, for whom every encounter with a strange man carries with it the possibility of sexual predation, even if it doesn't materialize (which, the film acknowledges, in most cases it doesn't). At the same time, the film restores one's faith a little bit in humanity, suggesting that most people are decent and kind and willing to help, no strings attached.

Witherspoon and Dern were both justly Oscar nominated for their performances, and the gorgeous Pacific West scenery deserved an award of its own.

Grade: A

I loved this movie. 

My favorite part about this movie is the idea - being true to ones feelings, being destroyed by pain to the point of loosing oneself and having the strength to finding it again; having the strength and incredible will to let go and move on. I find it deep and insightful.

I also like the presentation of this idea - in a simple, very honest way. That's why I think, the symbolism they used fits in so well, even though it's a bit obvious - the heavy bag she carries at the beginning of the journey, bleeding feet, getting new shoes that fit, throwing up (as letting all the bad things out) and coming to the gods bridge. All of these are classic, obvious symbols, which are in tune with the simpleness of the presentation of the idea. 

This brings me to another point I like about this movie, how it contrasts this very simple plot and very simple presentation to very complicated 'things' inside the main character. I also have to mention the script, because its loooong time since I have seen/heard such a good script - communicating the drama of one's life without overdoing it. 

And OK, there are some factual errors in this movie, but they are not so important and Witherspoon did a great job as an actress and a producer. For me it's her best movie so far. 

So to sum it up - strong drama, in simple, honest presentation, inspiring to return to your good self, no matter what may happen. The way we deal with our feelings, is the way we leave.

Your life will most likely determine whether or not you like this film, whether or not it moves you.

I read the book and was not sure how they were going to make such an introspective novel into a movie but they did a pretty good job. My group of friends had mixed reactions, some of us were deeply moved (myself included) some where wondering why we were...

I felt the way her story was portrayed in flashbacks was very effective and about the only way to tell this story. It can never be as deep as the emotions in the book and it had to skim over a lot but still, for me and others I was with it was very powerful.

On a superficial side note... I wish she had looked dirtier. Her hair and clothes always looked too clean for what she was doing with very minimal hygiene.

Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.

At first, it's hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she can shew, it's clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are peppered throughout the movie and like anyone you're getting to know she starts to make sense. You get to understand what she's been through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. It's a challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she needed.

And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet strength that suited the character. I didn't totally relate to Cheryl but I wasn't completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams and life-goals to achieve.

On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild as the female lead version of Into The Wild. I've never finished Sean Penn & Emile Hirsh's hiking movie but from what I remember Into The Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasn't on a hiking trail but in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these two characters have to undertake their journey.

Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in one's truth. @wornoutspines

I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.

Like the life of a lot of people, this movie is about the journey we take. Its not about the destination or achieving a particular purpose. It is deeply realistic, and i am glad it doesn't lecture or give a moral lesson on how we should be ,or a happy ending because we don't always get that in life. Life is ugly and it doesn't always end in happiness and things don't always happen for a reason good people do not always get a good ending and normal people can do bad things to themselves and to toh others due to pain brought on by unbearable grief. This movie inspires me to maybe run a marathon.

Walking, hiding and running are very meditative and its like a metaphor for life, no matter what happened, all we can do is keep walking.

Fans of Cheryl Strayed likely come away from this movie feeling reasonably content with the outcome. There's no challenge to the end product or hope for anything more. Reese Witherspoon is a pretty personification that many can put their hopes and dreams and selves into and flutter away to the pretty pictures of mountains for a few fleeting moments in their day. For the rest of us, however, the movie is quite unmemorable and intangible. If anything, we simply watch Strayed (Witherspoon) walk around like an entitled, annoyed bitch for two hours, getting into trouble, doing stupid things, hurting anyone close to her, and then crying over spill milk again and again. And all along there's this audacious overtone telling us we should be feeling sorry for Strayed and her struggles give me a break.

It's clear Jean-Marc Vallee wanted to produce an Oscar-season prospect, not an accurate or truly vulnerable adaptation. Coming off his success with Dallas Buyers Club, Vallee wanted to shift momentum to a prettier landscape and fill in the rest with exhausting flashbacks for back story. I can visualize what he was aiming for, and it could have been a shoe-in for best picture or certainly best actress. Unfortunately the end product missed the target by thousands of miles. Wild is tiresome, disjointed and certainly not Oscar-worthy material. The big difference between the two films is that Dallas was based on a tremendous story, one of transformation and growth, which is why it resonated so well with audiences. Wild is not a tremendous story, not even a good one, and simply takes the same approach as another vain diatribe, "Eat Pray Love." Essentially, a struggling female writer feels trapped in her life and decides to try something extreme, get herself out of this rut and find purpose (then shockingly decides to write a book about it and capitalize off all the people who want to do the same. CRAZY!). I won't argue that Strayed didn't have a rough go at it. With the death of her mother, her rotten coping mechanisms through anonymous sex and heroin use, the consequent failure of her marriage and the downward spiral of her life, Strayed was headed nowhere before she found the path of the PCT. But that does not excuse how ego-driven and basic Wild is (and is told).

Strayed is the ugliest character in the story. Aside from a terrible voice-over at the end (seriously, WTF was that?), Strayed truly does not change physically, emotionally or in her relationships from beginning to end. Yet somehow the film goes out of its way to make her a hero, innocent and a victim in this crazy world around her. We see this when all the rangers, hikers, townsfolk, even customers at the diner she's waiting at all want to rape her or take advantage. Apparently every man in the 90s was absolutely horrible (even the husband she was cheating on who drove across the country to fetch her out of a drug den and save her life. Hrm). The most ironic part is how Strayed described in the book that she wanted to sleep with nearly every man that crossed her path (including most men on the trail), and at times she said she had to hold herself back. And that's the worst part of Wild, the blatant, phony feminist propaganda. Feminism is so trendy in pop culture right now that everyone is claiming they're a part of the cause. But it's a word that is completely misappropriated and misused, especially by quite terrible role models such as Cheryl Strayed. She is a woman who wants to desperately be considered a feminist that she adjusts her story to justify her mistakes, even throwing in the line, "I am a feminist," into the movie to frantically convince us. But she's not. Being a selfish, inconsiderate asshole doesn't make you a feminist or a martyr. It makes you a selfish, inconsiderate asshole, and not a person the viewer should want to feel compassion for.

To be honest, one of the best parts of the book was the relationships and perspectives of others who Strayed came across on the trail. We got to hear what they were going through, not just getting hit over the head by a whiny Witherspoon. Yet the theatrical version (again) only focuses on Cheryl and her theoretical struggle with life (i.e. herself). We totally skip over all the other people who in my opinion were the 'therapists' and friends who helped Cheryl to grow and guide her change into a new woman and move beyond her horrible past.

If the story is intended to be one about personal growth and finding oneself, then there is none of that here in this adaptation. For a 15-minute montage Reese is bitching and moaning about hiking and her life, then suddenly we're at the end of the trek and she's telling us about how happy-ever-after things are going to be in the future. It was like Vallee just said, "I'm over it," and decided to end the terrible experiment. By the end of this movie I find myself really caring less about Strayed (even distrusting her more since she signed off on this thing), and I'm insulted by her story and embarrassed that so many embrace her and what she did as some sort of feminist martyrdom. I think Strayed was a stupid girl who did stupid things, and out of sheer blonde luck was able to survive a trek on her own. Even more luck, she was able to turn that mediocre story into millions of dollars in her pocket. So good for her. It's not a terrible movie, just a terrible story about a terrible person who wants us all to believe she's a saint. I don't buy it, and unfortunately I rented the movie and bought the book.

Realistic performance of Reese Witherspoon. An history about the life as it is. A movie to watch and review in your mind later. I like drama movies that you suffer as you are watching but give you things to think later, this is this type of movie. Wild is a one-character movie but the little pieces of the secondary characters are so well introduced that allows to introduce drama, fear, suspense and romanticism to the history. If I need to say something wrong about the movie is that in some passages there is lack of continuity and feels as if the movie was longer at the beginning and the director need to cut it to do it shorter.

A story of redemption heavy on pain and short on redemption. Reese Witherspoon produces and stars in this story of a woman whose breathtakingly self-destructive behavior--drugs, adultery, degrading sexual encounters, abortion--has brought about a crisis that even she can no longer ignore. Desperate to break the pattern of her life, she decides to set out on a 1000 mile hike of the Pacific Crest trail, despite having little or no experience with backpacking. From her vivid memories of her past misbehavior, we see that she is slowly coming to accept responsibility for her past mistakes, and thereby moving beyond them. 

But the viewer gets very little payoff for this long slog through her lurid past. While she manages to drag herself back to a state of normalcy, she makes no great spiritual revelations during her journey. Her hike ends underwhelmingly at the Bridge of the Gods on the Oregon-Washington border. She and the movie seem to understand that there should be some greater significance to that, but they don't know what it might be. And contrary to other reviews, the scenery in the movie isn't "gorgeous," but for the Pacific Crest trail is quite ordinary. It's a great mystery that the movie makers didn't at least take advantage of that aspect of the story to treat the viewers to some of the scenery of the West.

In the end, there isn't enough compensation for the graphic and disturbing imagery that the movie makes its viewers endure, making this movie a missed opportunity.

An arduous journey across America on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed tests her tenacity to continue forward till the end. There's very little else to the story, which makes this film really powerful. With not much else other than a tedious walk and a vampish past the story bobs back and forth between the present and the past revealing how Cheryl finds herself in such a circumstance and why she cant stop until she is finished. 

At first Cheryl seems like a woman unable to let go of her now ex-husband, beginning a journey with more baggage than is necessary. It might almost be easy to throw this story into the bin of sappy chick-flicks when that inability to get closure on a relationships end is actually fronting as more of an act of remorse and regret. She messed up. And there is no way to repair the damage without an ugly scar.

The further she goes the more she dives into the series of events that lead her to such a devastating circumstance of sex and drugs. The loss of her mother is far too much for her to feel. The depth of such pain can sometimes strip a human being from feeling anything at all. The tears flow from her face but those tears are not falling for grief, they drop from the overwhelming numbing the death has caused. 

Cheryl's emotions are lost in a wild and desolate space that is pain and grief, which is so perfectly mirrored with the vast, open landscape she is now physically wondering through. And both her emotions and the land are the same: it wont change immediately and things will be tough but if one keeps going forward one will come out of it. And better for it. Cheryl just needed that physical aspect to make the connection with her emotions. The self-loathing and destructive life she was living was the equivalence of her just lying down on the sandy path and dying right there. 

It's a fairly event-less film where a woman just goes through some fairly tough terrain but somehow the flashes to her past spliced in with the turmoil of her present moves the story along swimmingly.

If you're a fan of deeply emotional story lines this one might very well be worth the watch.

We loved this film...and this is NOT a "chick flick"...it's for ALL of us and it's about our search for our individual and authentic selves - male or female... so don't miss it! 

I think Reese Witherspoon has created an incredible film with her team. Kudos ...one of your best ever films and we are looking for more from your production company in the future. An Oscar nomination is so well deserved and we will be looking for you on TV that night. 

I Love how you portrayed the essence of a silent retreat and all the riches and gifts and stresses of doing one. WILD does an amazing job of illustrating this worthwhile experience in an individual's life.

This movie was AWFUL. The only good thing I can say about it is that we bonded watching it because we were all laughing and cursing at how awful the movie was. The flashbacks were horribly done - cutting in and out until you're nauseous with no flow and no benefit to the film itself.

Biggest problem I think everyone would agree on: The description of this film needs to be changed. If the description actually described the film, I would never have wasted my time watching it and thus never realized how brutal it is and never have commented on it. It says it's a movie about the PCT. It's not. We see maybe 5 minutes of the trail in it. Change the description to say it's about a druggie sex maniac psycho woman who goes for a hike and has never hiked before. that's about the extent of the content and outcome of the movie. don't even mention the PCT; it's irrelevant to the movie.

I am an avid hiker, and saw this movie to get an idea of the trail, the challenges of the trail, and how the drop offs work, etc. To have to withstand the poorly acted crybaby "I've never hiked before and didn't plan anything or think anything through" idiocy, weirdo makeup (clearly those people have also never hiked before - bleeding knuckles like she was in a fist fight after she set up the tent on day 1 after 5 seconds on the trail??), combined with the crappy scenery and worst cut-in/cut-out so-called flashbacks was too much. I turned it off LOL. insanely terrible. i'd vote 0 if I could.

Right from the moment I saw the first poster, I was keen and excited and was eagerly looking forward to watching this movie. I am a big fan of adventure movies. Well, to cut the story short, if you are the person who likes Bear Grylls jungle-survival documentaries or if you have loved The Edge or The Rainman or even Alive (movie about some sports team lost in snow-fields when their plane crashes), then THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU. GIVE IT A MISS. It's extremely boring with minute-after-minute flashbacks and at the climax scene, I don't know what she really achieved. I was just waiting for her to finish her walk within 20mins. into the movie, such meaningless it is.

I saw Wild last night. I typically read reviews after watching movies but on this occasion read a number of IMDb reviews before watching the movieone was positive and three very negative. Two friends had recommended the movie and I approached Wild with these thoughts in mind.

I loved Wild. The scenes were beautifulespecially the desert, the snow, and Crater Lake in Oregon. The Bridge of the Gods overlooked a beautiful stretch of the Columbia River (which I have visited only at night). This will be important to nature loversfor me just the scenes made the movie worth watching.

Reese has been criticized for not being realistic as a drug / sex addict and for lacking range. I found her to be one perfect type. In her background were physically abusive male grown ups but her mother was very nurturing and loving and encouraging of Reese's character, Cheryl's, development. Going into her period of abuse, then, she was not a typical 'user'. Not that there is a type but while she was losing her center she did not lose it altogether. I imagine that there might have been more evident struggle, suffering and perhaps hysteria ('acting') but not necessarily; some people suffer quietly. Reese did this well. The character would have scored high in introversion.

I liked the story-lineone woman finding redemption in the wild. In some movies flashbacks are part of the story, making for non-linearity. In this movie I saw the scenes from the past not as stylistic flashbacks but as Cheryl's thought bubbles as she hiked; the editing could have been less choppy but the idea worked well for me. When I'm out hiking the physicality of it, the wonder at nature, and my own thought bubbles are all large parts of the experience.

Which reminds me, I would have liked more nature in the movie; it would have been nice to see more hiking; and it would have been nice to see more attention to Cheryl's physical and skill development as a hiker. Her pack was a huge mess in the beginning (natural for a beginner without much preparation) but it would have been nice to see it get smaller and tidier; it would have been nice to see some real hiking skills. And her emotional growth could have been developed betterit seemed rather sudden at the endthere could have been more continuity, perhaps with growth as well as setbacks. Perhaps, though, given her 'sophistication'by which I mean her growth as a person before she entered her time of 'difficulty' with drugs and sexsudden realization might have been natural.

Overall I liked the story and the themes a lot; the editing and Cheryl's growth as a person could have been done better. I've given Wild an 8 because I really did enjoy it. I do think the movie could be re-done better. But, as a long time backpacker in wilderness areas of America, Wild appealed to me very much. My story is not Cheryl's but the wild has loomed large in my life and growth.

Wild is based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed about her lone hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey is meant to be an escape from her personal problems and possibly rehabilitating herself from a troubling past. It expresses these feelings thoroughly; at every turn, there has to be a reminder of what she's been through, but also deals with a potential danger in this hike. The movie lives up to its sentiment, the pain and obstacles that the story goes through feel genuine and it leaves us such a rewarding experience. There are some parts that can feel a little uneven, but its spirit stays intact, enduring what the movie is meant to be.

There are several conflicts in this hike. Firstly is how inexperienced Strayed is in the wilderness, trying to reach her destination with a heavy backpack, tight shoes, raw meals, and even faces anything that could possibly harm her, including wild animals and strangers that appears to her as a threat. The other is basically remembering the past of losing her mother and her addiction out of depression. The main point here is how she deals with these problems; the flashbacks may be just any other drama, but it helps clearing out her motivations and fleshing out who she is. Though, the emotions are more genuine when she is simply isolated, helpless from any conflict until she learns lifting herself back up, literally and metaphorically.

It carefully lingers at how difficult to proceed this walk which makes her seemingly small actions look like a truly serious risk. The camera just lets the audience experience the same feeling of pain and exhaustion on what she is doing. Reese Witherspoon naturally pictures the vital parts of Strayed's emotional and physical struggles, while building a full character along the trek. But the movie doesn't always have to be tough, whenever it stops into places with people, there is a real pleasant feeling around, especially when she is just expressing her thoughts to whoever she just met.

There are a some flaws that are worth mentioning, specifically when it occasionally takes turn to a far different direction later on, somewhat abandoning the consistent emotion it accomplished. The very last part also ended up verbalizing the entire theme, kind of dropping the poetic intentions. But they didn't outweigh much of its merits. Because no matter what happened there, Wild is still a journey that earned something satisfyingly heartfelt. Most of the credit may go to Reese Witherspoon as she thoughtfully carries the whole film. Even when it sort of stumbles in some parts, the movie still delivers the story with sincerity and real emotions that made it this great.

Very typical of Hollywood to overrate a movie when it comes to leading actresses. This movie did nothing for me, in terms of script or scenery. It's some women trying to deal with loss, that is not even heart wrenching. Seriously, it's part of life, and this is nothing compared to what other women go through on a daily basis. So wake up American women, not everything is picketed fence and this movie doesn't even come close to showing reality of what's nature is like. I can't stand Reese, she represents the most type of obnoxious Americans, that's hated. 

It's on a bloody walking trail, not like she's hiking some outback country in Australia 

There's a movie that takes place in outback country in Australia, no hiking path, no halfway house, no people in site. And the character in that is that movie instead is more convincing and the story definitely worth watching for the scenery, 100x better than this one. Waste of time. Now, that is something not every person can do, unlike a hike in the park, like this one. Wast of time.

It is so cheesy than I cannot even believe how I kept watching... probably hoping another ending and due to the photography and music. Seems Hollywood, as it is: could even be Disney. Into the wild was totally different and have a good script. Even if it is a true story, read the damn biographies: is so so easy... did she actually walk for 3 months? how many miles did she do by car? Furthermore, all the beautiful sentences comes from books. She just add one and seems like a heroine? I miss so so much the true feelings of Into the wild and also the respect for the true story. My God.. and the ending... Movie for people who will never hike!

For the last couple years hiking on the PCT, I have heard about the book the Wild mainly from non-hikers. I curiously watched this to see what the fuss was about. My experience on the trail was vastly different from the portrayal in the movie. Strayed was very inexperienced and most of the drama stems from that. Also most PCT hikers only really worry about the next water source, getting in their miles, and the next resupply stop.I felt the movie did not really capture the every day life of a PCT hiker very well brushing over common hiker dialog and every day tasks. I will note that backpacking has changed a lot since Strayed hiked. The gear is lighter, we use trail runners instead of hiking boots, trekking poles, and the trail is more popular which is good and bad. The most off putting aspect for someone who has hiked the trail before is the locations and terrain vary greatly from the actual trail. Sometimes I felt that Strayed got lost her entire hike climbing over rocks at Smith Rock in Oregon. Aka the PCT is graded for horses. What was she doing? For someone who would like to watch this movie and recreate great memories, I found it very difficult. The simplest way to explain it is her experience depresses my experience. The real trail is far greater than the movie depicts. The solo hiking women I have met on trail are very strong, independent, and are more than capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. There are people I have met on trail with disabilities and amazing life stories that I think would have made a better movie.

No secret that I love one-man survival films (although this wasn't that type of "survival" film). Still, despite very good reviews, there was always a severe lack of hype and passion it seemed (certainly here). Maybe that's why I was so surprised. Usually this kind of heavy-edited, heavy- flashback-intercutting-with-main-story film alienates me emotionally for that reason. Too much back and forth. I had the same problem with 2007's Into The Wild, which so often prevented me from getting too involved with it. For some reason I didn't have that problem here. The actual story, as well as the dramatic ticks in the flashbacks and even in the present, aren't anything we haven't seen before dozens of times. However, the film really managed work despite that. The editing I found to enhance the film immensely, and the specific style of the intercutting with her memories managed to make the film more powerful. 

I like Witherspoon just fine in Walk The Line, but it was all mostly surface-level. She was fun, but any lasting impact? Not at all. She's truly fantastic here, and she will get a very deserved nomination tomorrow. Now, everyone knows how much I'd been rooting for Laura Dern for a nomination. I hadn't seen it, but she's one of my favorite actresses. But so many reports of her role being super small, almost a cameo. Her role technically is super small, less than 10 minutes for sure, but the relationship between her and Witherspoon is the central relationship at the core here. Dern's presence is felt throughout to an incredible degree. And she really does have a meaty role for such short screen time. It reminds me of Jessica Chastain in The tree Of Life and also to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, perfect depiction of that feeling of compassion and motherly love that is eternal. Dern is one of those actors that can move me with so little, so I don't think this was at all anything difficult for her, but either way, she manages to become such an undeniable, powerful part of the film. The editing is part of the reason that central relationship works, but the scenes Dern gets to convey her entire character are flawlessly acted and, so beautifully ethereal. I had feared for a while there that it would be such a small role she'd make no lasting impact, but of course she'd make an impact. It's Laura Dern after all.

The film had its interesting moments but Witherspoon's horrible character she portrayed and the many flashbacks got in the way and interrupted the movie's flow. I found myself just not caring, liking or sympathizing with Witherspoon's character in the least. I mean, many people have rough, tragic lives but we all don't go off the deep end and become drug-addicted, foul mouthed, adulterous, disrespectful, promiscuous sluts. There is nothing noble or overcoming about this movie. It's a story about an unlikeable, mentally dysfunctional woman trying to resolve her problems by taking a hike. Instead of wasting 2 hours on this dog, I should have taken a hike away from my TV.

It's amazing how much hate and contempt this movie and the book it was adapted from has created on IMDb. I had the pleasure of seeing this at the Fleur Cinema in Des Moines prior to reading about the movie on IMDb. For some reason I connected immediately with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Cheryl Strayed...and through that performance felt a kinship with Ms. Strayed. Odd, as I assume she is someone I will never have the chance to meet in person. Perhaps it was associating with an underdog who perseveres. The cinematography captured me as I was lucky to have spent summers in the area around the PCT and was stationed nearby as well in my early twenties. I never imagined myself actually hiking the entire trail John Muir style. I could drive from trail to trail in my trusty automobile with a wallet full of Navy pay and drive back to civilization and sleep on a nice safe spongy Navy bunk. The film as a whole: the combination of directing, filming, acting, brought to me just how difficult it would be to attempt to hike the majority of the PCT. Just the courage to begin the journey was awe inspiring to me. I personally still can't believe Ms. Strayed actually did this, to me it's a monumental achievement...something I'd be proud of my entire life. That she undertook this journey after suffering so many tragedies and personal misfortunes in her life is even more impressive in my opinion. If you view the forum on here you'll encounter many people who don't understand why this film or book were ever created. Obviously these people have absolutely no clue what it takes to undergo such a mission, or journey, or life experience...whatever you choose to call it. To me, the end of the film, where Ms. Strayed comes out on the other side and experiences with what I believe is pure joy, relief, and peace is the reason for the film to be made. I don't really care what other people feel, it's Ms. Strayed's story...I just hope she was as pleased with the film and Ms. Witherspoon's portrayal as I was.

I may be an old dude, but I hope to one day walk the same trail with friends...albeit on a slower time frame. Just so I can see and experience what she did, and find out about myself some of what she came to realize at the end.

Hiking a long distance as a way to recover from a recent personal drama might sound like a justified action to undertake. But when the protagonist is a woman, travelling alone, on foot, on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) for more than 1800 kilometres, from Mexican border to the Canadian border, many questions come to your mind.

Cheryl Strayed doesn't look as one who can deal with such a challenge. She's physically unprepared, she didn't follow a training, she carries a too large and heavy backpack and she didn't take the proper things with her. She looks naive to set out to such a hard journey. 

Flashbacks constantly interrupt the sequence of the challenges Cheryl faces into the wild. They are meant to reveal, although not in chronological order, the facts that determined her to make this decision. Losing the person we have loved most may cause a terrible grief. Of course, I have not agreed with the way Cheryl had initially chosen to struggle with the cruel, unfair loss but I can admit that people react in very different, unpredictable ways when they feel lost. Also Cheryl, I think, after realizing the wrong way she had taken, makes this dangerous journey to somehow punish herself. On the other hand, she might feel motivated once more to overcome the past and move on. It is what her mother (wonderful performance of Laura Dern) would ask her to do. She was a very positive person despite the difficulties she encountered during her life. And this is the attitude she passed to her daughter.

Jean-Marc Vallee (who also directed the good film 'Dallas Buyers Club') did a very good job. The landscapes are beautiful, the nature is fascinating. The very few people Cheryl meets on the road are so real, with more or less principles, some trying to take advantage of any opportunity. But, by far, the performance of the leading character (Reese Witherspoon) is the best. I was taken aback how the 'legally blonde' succeeded to be so credible, so human while she went through the various states: pain, sufferance, anger, fear or commitment. I had a change of heart in regards with her acting potential. She bravely (literally and figuratively) carries the burdens on her shoulders (by the way, she is quite funny carrying that overloaded backpack). 

I haven't read the book (probably the emotions transmitted directly by the Cheryl's memoirs are much deeper) but, nevertheless, I think the movie is a powerful lesson about acceptance, self forgiveness, keeping your chin up and keep walking. I definitively recommend watch it.

After consummating "McConaissance" in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013), Jean-Marc Vallée's next step is another star-vehicle biography, Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a young woman embarked on a 2,650-mile hike of Pacific Crest Trail from Minneapolis, Minnesota to the Bridge of the Gods connecting Oregon and Washington in 1995. The aim of her journey is to detoxicate herself from her past bad habits of promiscuity and heroin addiction which had encroached her entire life after the untimely death of her mother Bobbi (Dern) and had already destroyed her marriage with Paul (Sadoski). 

Opening with a cringing-inducing toenail-plucking gambit, as if the film is promising us an unpromising depiction of the mission-impossible trek for a novice hiker, then incessantly throws back spasmodic flashbacks to proffer backgrounds of our heroine in order to wheedle us into awe-inspiring admiration. The approach is recommendable, but there is a problem at hand (at least for me), my admiration is already in full default mode for anyone who has the willpower and actually accomplishes the formidable undertaking, so to progressively know her back-story can only amass my cynical suspicions of either a victorious bandwagon out of vainglory or a navel-gazing inspection to find an excuse for her self-destructive conducts, or both. Fortunately, the film opts for a safer route, neither blatantly beautifies her ritual of reborn, nor goes digging deep into her most vulnerable part in her memories. Generically, it maintains her long haul in a tepid temperature apart from the overhanging threat of being raped in the wilderness, as the ethical yardstick for Cheryl's before/after metamorphosis. 

Witherspoon finally proves that it is not just a fluke for her (undeserving) Oscar triumph in WALK THE LINE (2005, 9/10), which takes her almost a decade. Granted that the physical endeavour of a petite Witherspoon shouldering on her ginormous backpack for the first time before her hiking already pre-empts audience's respect, she is still unable to fuel her role with a consistent intensity to make viewers wow for her through and through, check her scenes with Dern, where she conspicuously fades into background or looks rather wooden in comparison, the but when she is on her own, she is fine, sometimes even great, for her daring nudes scenes and (spoiler alert) making out with drop-dead gorgeous Michiel Huisman.

Laura Dern is the dark horse in the BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS race this year, since her screen time is not only brief, but exclusively in flashbacks as well, not to mention most of those scenes are edited into transitory fragments as if she is just a symbolistic prop to burden Cheryl's mental state. In fact Dern has only one Oscar-bait scene when she tells Cheryl the reason of being cheerful and optimistic in their not-so-perfect life, she nails it impeccably, and de facto she is the one who really deserves a renaissance! 

On a whole, I'm a bit underwhelmed by the movie, the performances is its strongest suit, but the empty nature of its material restrains it from being a resounding feminist opus, and Vallée's execution doesn't enhance the film to match the caliber of his best offering, aka. C.R.A.Z.Y. (2005, 8/10).

This movie is motherlovin atrocious. Judging by the struggle she was having in the hotel with the backpack, she wouldn't have made it 2 steps after finally getting it on! I couldn't take the movie serious after that. The voice overs and flashbacks are annoying and done in a very cheesy manner. Acting is bad! Nowhere near Oscar! The director was trying so hard to capture a feeling of "into the wild" crossed with Gus Van Sant's "Gerry" but failed miserably. I've never directed a movie before but given even 1/4th the budget I'm positive I could have done a much better job. Everyone was telling me how stupid thus movie is but I was bored and trusted the reviews here instead. I should've listened to real people. Not the neo vegetarian malnourished feminists that would enjoy this. This should've been a straight to Lifetime movie.
