### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
To watch actors dryly deliver page after page of plot that no one comprehends or is interested in while they imitate the acting style of old Hollywood noir films and stoner comedies is not why I go to the movies. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great filmmaker when he uses his own voice, and thankfully this film is the only exception to that.

Unless you're a superhuman, you won't have the memory (or attention span) to understand the plot. It's as if it's deliberately convoluted, like Anderson doesn't want us to know what's going on, or at least doesn't want us to care. Yet this is not the case because of the scenes that dwell on nothing else but dialogue whose only purpose is to read plot to us and maybe put us to sleep. 

There isn't any character beyond caricature. I don't relate to this Doc character beyond the his relationship with his ex-girlfriend which is the only thing that one can possibly invest emotion into, albeit this is not an emotionally driven story. The characters are supposed to be funny but I just found them bizarre. 

That being said, there is something about the overall tone and production design of the film that sticks. The meandering nature of the era is there and while we've seen many similar films about the 70s this film is just different. It's ambitious in the way that it's so plain but also strange, only many will have a hard time deciphering between art and bullshit. It's bullshit to me because there wasn't anything for me to take from the film. It was more "this is kind of weird" but to no end.

I would not recommend this film to anyone unless you are a cinephile, in which case you just have to see it because it's Paul Thomas Anderson. I feel bad for anyone who naively walks into this film looking for something to enjoy and laugh at. Parts got laughs but they were widely dispersed in a film that just felt like it wouldn't end. Being the fan of Anderson's that I am I feel like this film was a waste of time. Even if you end up liking it (which I personally would not understand) you'll see what I mean.

Paul Thomas Anderson's seventh film, Inherent Vice, is a surreal, kinky, and stoned epic of mammoth proportions. The fact that Anderson decided to be the first director adapt the wild prose of Thomas Pynchon is an achievement in of itself. Set in Los Angeles in the early Seventies, Larry "Doc" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) awakens from his stony stupor when his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) tries to find sanctuary from her real-estate mogul boyfriend, his wife, and her boyfriend. In traditional noir fashion, not all is simple as it sounds as a bigger presence is involved with a cavalcade of characters thrown into Doc's world; a heroin-addicted sax player from a surf-rock band (Owen Wilson), a coked- up dentist with the libido of a rabbit (Martin Short), and an LAPD officer/failed actor (Josh Brolin) busting anyone with long-hair and forming a strange love/hate bond with Doc.

The film is a hybrid of comedy, romance, and mystery inspired by the major film-noir flicks of the 1940s, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep and Fritz Lang's Ministry of Fear, except that rather than having Sam Spade chain smoke cigarettes and drink gimlets, you have Doc Sportello smoking endless joints and drinking tequila zombies. Anderson's perspective of Los Angeles in the Seventies has been shown before in Boogie Nights in all its hedonistic glory, but in the case of Inherent Vice, he manages to capture the mood of L.A. in an earthy, yet naive glow that mirrors the energy and fear that erupted in the wake of the Manson murders and the rise of Nixon's silent majority. No matter how you slice it, Anderson's film fits in the tapestry of other L.A. noir classics like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, but with the comedic antics of a Cheech and Chong film or an episode of Gilligan's Island. 

Joaquin Phoenix gives a brilliantly-nuanced performance as Pynchon's anti-hero private eye. Unlike his last collaboration with Anderson on The Master, Phoenix reigns in his eccentricity with a relaxed, yet stoned, approach and manages to not make Sportello into a clich√©d character of the counterculture thanks to the sharp wit and dialogue of Anderson's screenplay. Josh Brolin's performance as Bigfoot Bjornsen is brilliantly comical and tragic as he tries to walk amongst the Indica-smoke streets with the power and authority of Jack Webb from Dragnet. Katherine Waterston gives a remarkable performance as Doc's former flame as she gives a raw and naked performance that is both sympathetic and mysterious. Despite being on film for only ten minutes, Martin Short gives a performance of comedic gold with the eccentricity and insanity as equally as funny as his alter egos like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick. Among the other actors who fill out the film, Reese Witherspoon as an assistant D.A. and Doc's part-time love interest, Benecio Del Toro as Doc's confidant and Owen Wilson each give solid performances. 

Jonny Greenwood, in his third collaboration with Anderson as composer, creates a score that mirrors the Noir-fashioned sounds of Jerry Goldsmith mixed with the psychedelic sounds of the Laurel Canyon music scene of the early Seventies. Also, the music of Neil Young's Harvest album adds an emotional depth to the romantic interludes between Doc and the women in his life. Robert Elswit's cinematography is as excellent as his previous collaborations with Anderson as he manages to capture the long, strange trip into the underbelly of Los Angeles. Inherent Vice may be at times incoherent and somewhat dense as Pynchon's novel, but it is one hell of a trip!

I was fortunate enough to see this at the 52nd New York Film Festival; the centerpiece of this year's festival, Paul Thomas Anderon's Inherent Vice (adapted from the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name) will no doubt divide critics and audiences. It certainly divided me.

Immediately, the plot starts rolling. "Doc" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix in his '70s glory; mutton chops and scraggly hair), a pot-head private detective, is disturbed by the arrival of his ex, Shasta Fay (Katherine Waterston). She clues Doc in on a mysterious plot to kidnap a real-estate mogul (Shasta's current boyfriend) for his money, and the scrappy "gum-sandal" ventures off into the the beach-towns and high-hills of California. Receiving help/hindrance from his "friend" at the LAPD, Lieutenant "Bigfoot" Bjornsen (a clean-cut, hippie-hating Josh Brolin), Doc rubs shoulders with no shortage of strange and potentially-dangerous characters. And that's about as much plot as you're going to get out of me. Doc's adventures are almost episodic, and connecting the dots from A to B to... G? can be difficult. I have a somewhat-strong idea of how things unfold, but the specifics are lost on me. And I even read the book! However, I believe this wasn't entirely accidental.

In describing Inherent Vice, Anderson has made reference to all kinds of classic detective stories and zany comedies. On the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest, he said "Tell me again how he (Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill) gets to the middle of the field with a plane after him? I can't. How does he get to Mount Rushmore? I don't know, but it's great." PTA goes for a film that is high on emotion and fun situations and low on intricate story. I describe it by saying "There's a lot of story, but so little of it matters," and that's in the best way possible. Doing so allows Anderson to focus on his eclectic cast of characters.

Phoenix's Doc is most-definitely comparable to The Dude (Jeff Bridges) of Big Lebowski fame, but he's a far more human character than "The other Lebowski". He has opinions, he's far more active and realistic than The Dude. He has moments of violence (one in particular that shocked me and, I'm sure, the other thousand people in the theater). The trailer's narrator mentions something like "Doc's not a do-gooder, but he does good." An apt description. Complimenting this burnt-out detective is Josh Brolin's charismatic badge-holder, "Bigfoot". Brolin plays Bigfoot as a straight man whose anger can burst out in comical brilliance. Even ordering pancakes with this guy is funny. The supporting players are equally on their game, but they have such little screen time it really boils down to Phoenix and Brolin. Martin Short appears for a scene that many I know are already considering to be the film's funniest; Owen Wilson plays a great character whose very nature I find hilarious; Katherine Waterston is excellent as Shasta, being morose and desperate. The others among the star-studded cast are all at least "good", but I won't delve into their roles, which are more like cameos.

Now, it may come into conflict with what I've just said, but to me, Inherent Vice isn't particularly hilarious. The trailer certainly makes it appear to be an almost Tarantino-esque crime/comedy, but truly the tone is more melancholic. It's not a "downer", but the pale, sort of washed-out cinematography of Robert Elswit is far more subtle and restrained than something like Pulp Fiction or Anderson's own Boogie Nights. This came as a shock to me, as many were touting Inherent Vice as (paraphrasing) "Anderson's most-anarchic film since Boogie Nights". Perhaps so, but it never reaches that film's levels of kinetic energy and life. It's the yin to Boogie Nights' yang, to get metaphorical. It's more The Master than Magnolia, to keep the comparisons coming. However, with Inherent Vice, Anderson applies some of his hallmarks in new and interesting ways. His incredible tracking shots in Boogie Nights are replaced with more subtle long takes that will sometimes follow the action, but often stay nearly-static on a conversation for minutes. This immersive, unflinching approach allows you to become invested in the performances.

Similarly, Anderson's knack for putting together a soundtrack is tested in a new way. Rather than blaring '70s rock tunes, the Jonny Greenwood score and licensed tracks are included in a far more subtle way. Greenwood's score ranges from classical noir-ish tones to beach-like guitar music. It's an interesting choice, and one that didn't immediately strike me upon first viewing.

Some have called Inherent Vice meandering, and I'd say they're partially right. Depending on how they mean that. It wanders like a lost dog, yet clearly there's a story going on. It's fragmented, maybe like Doc's mind as he's stoned, but it isn't exactly a first-person view we're getting. It's odd, to say the least, but not in an in-your-face way. It's odd because you'll walk out likely-unable to connect the story, but you'll remember distinct scenes. Even those scenes though, may have subverted your expectations.

My "review" here probably sounds inconclusive, and that's because I'm still not positive how I feel about Inherent Vice. It's definitely worth seeing; Anderson is an incredible force with a pen and some film stock (nicely, we were shown 'Vice on 35mm; referring to the Film Society of Lincoln Center's slogan, Anderson said something like "Tonight, film really DOES live here!"), and I truly believe him to be one of the all-time greats already, with only seven films under his belt. So hopefully my little pontifications have been of some interest. Able to hold you over until this goes limited in December, or for some of you, wide in January. Temper your expectations, take the trailer with a grain of salt, and I'll see you on-line when it opens again--I need to see it again!

Not more than 10 minutes in, excited as I was to see this movie, I thought maybe I was loosing my smarts...

There is no plot, way too many cameos, it pushes way to hard to be something cool, but falls flat. Lots of non cut a aways....which made it seem like I was watching an acting class. Just didn't feel natural, the pace of duologue awkward, and Phoenix, much as I love the guy, he looked like he was acting... I left feeling like i was back in High School, forced to watch a movie for film class, trapped, couldn't leave, no bathroom break, looking at the clock, and hoping there would not be a quiz later, Cuz I couldn't make sense of what the f*** I was watching....very disappointed...

Larry "Doc" Sportello, an unorthodox private-eye (Joaquin Phoenix) smokes a joint in his California shore-house--the waves on one side, and a whole mess of bad vibes on the other. Then in walks his ex-old lady, Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston), brining some of those bad vibes with her. She's with a married man now, Mickey Wolfmann, and his wife wants her help to make off with his money and get him sent to a loony-bin. Through a cloud of marijuana smoke, Doc barely manages to mumble, "I think I've heard of that happening once or twice." Agreed, Doc, that does seem pretty predictable. But then Wolfmann disappears and so does Shasta and the body count begins to climb. What follows is one of the most unique and unexpected trips of 2014. Inherent Vice throws the audience into the year 1970. Everyone wants to just smoke a joint and love each other, but they can't seem to stop the wave of paranoia that's overtaking them. As Doc delves deeper into the seemingly infinite mystery that unravels, neither he nor the audience is ever sure who to trust. One of these beautifully morally ambiguous characters is Lt. Det. Christian F. "Bigfoot" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who gets plenty of screen-time and spends most of it eating frozen bananas and railing against hippies. Brolin and Phoenix's on-screen chemistry is off the charts, and the complicated relationship between their characters is explored through scenes of extreme hilarity. At the same time that I was questioning Bigfoot's moral compass and how dedicated he really is to justice, I was watching the screen through a filter of tears from laughter. 

Many have been calling Inherent Vice a combination of Chinatown and The Big Lebowski, and that's a pretty accurate description. It blends the beautiful look and complicated plot of neo-noir films with an almost surreal kind of stoner-comedy and it meshes perfectly. It also pulls from retro-noir films like Sunset Blvd. and utilizes a large deal of narration. Noir films usually blend exposition with character development in their narration--The male protagonist narrates and his beautifully crafted sentences highlight how tough he is and how fed up with everything he's become--but Inherent Vice takes a different route entirely. Sortil√®ge (Joanna Newsom) narrates and exposition comes packaged together with an almost sentimental poetry that adds a layer to the loving, yet distrustful view of the Californian landscape. Sortil√®ge is a highly mysterious character that takes a lot of the narration verbatim from the novel by Thomas Pynchon that this film is based on. She's a seemingly omniscient, psychedelic chick who navigates the screen on a physical plane, but also enters and leaves Doc's mind through voice-over when she sees fit. 

Paul Thomas Anderson directs and this is another movie to add to his seemingly air-tight repertoire (Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood, Magnolia). He lets the actors navigate the screen with minimum editing and allows entire dialogue scenes happen in one take. This is a risky move-- cutting is usually used to increase humor or add suspense, but somehow this movie manages without it. I can't stress enough how humorous Doc's interactions with other characters are. And the more tense scenes thrust Doc into danger with little to no warning and effectively get the heart racing. 

I'm sure a lot of people will complain about the complexity of the plot in this one. As Doc makes his way through a haze of pot smoke, conspiracies, and government corruption more and more names are dropped and exactly what's going and on and who's pulling the strings becomes almost impossible to make out upon first viewing. This is because plot takes the backseat to the film's powerful entertainment value and its themes. When I watched it for the first time, I honestly didn't know what was happening after the half-way point, but I barely had time to think about it because I was so engrossed by the little episodes that the movie presents. One of my favorite scenes features Doc and Shasta in a flashback as they run through the rain with Neil Young's "Journey Through the Past" playing in the background. The music takes priority over the dialogue and I wanted to weep for this beautiful moment that was now lost in the "city dump" of Doc's memory. It cuts to Doc navigating the same area in present day and the vacant lot that him and Shasta had been running freely through has now been occupied by a building shaped like a Golden Fang--a symbol of the criminal organization that plagues the characters throughout their journeys.

And that, to me, is what the movie is all about. The simplicity of blissful ignorance being slowly replaced with growing knowledge of the darker side of the American dream. 1970 is the perfect year for this drama to unfold--characters can't stop talking about Charles Manson, and distrust of police is just beginning to evolve. Something wicked has been lying in wait and the movie takes place in that small window where optimism began to shrink back in the American mind and people began ignoring hitchhikers and locking their doors. The insane complexity of the plot only serves to highlight this more--great evil is operating under the surface, but Doc can never be totally sure how much of it is just in his head, or who is pulling the levers. Or maybe everyone's got a lever except for him. It's tough to tell when you're lightin' up a J and just trying to help somebody out.

This film tells the story of a private detective in Los Angeles who investigates the disappearance of his former girlfriend and a rich real estate tycoon.

"Inherent Vice" has a super incoherent plot. Not only do I not understanding a thing while watching it, I still don't understand it even when I paused the film and read the plot synopsis regularly. So the detective investigates the case, then somehow the case is completely forgotten because a prostitute tells him about a shipment of heroin. There are just far too many characters in the film, each one of them doing their little bit in the story that does not glue together as a whole. Every subplot gets mentioned them dropped, without any satisfactory resolution. This film is a tremendous waste of time!

Break out a pen and paper cause so much is going on it's hard to follow watching this for the first time. So many characters, so many plots surrounding sub-plots surrounding plots, you could easily lose your place if your attention wavers in the slightest. I felt like I needed to make an outline to make sense of it all. The movie is very hard to follow and needs a second viewing to fully grasp the whole thing.

My first impression is much like Joaquin Phoenix's character, a hazy pot soaked mind looking for a murderer with Bigfoot's help. No, no, he's looking for someone who was kidnapped by the Golden Fang Consortium of Nazi Heroin Smugglers led by dentist cokehead Martin Short. Or was he looking for Bigfoot's partner Littlefoot? I don't know nor do I care. One scene seemingly does not follow from the next and the whole movie became a big jumble I had no interest in solving.

All I have left in my brain are foggy recollections of details to what felt like an infinity of plots and characters. While some scenes have 'A Big Lebowski' vibe to them and were entertaining, they're sadly not enough to make me sit through this a second time. And I'm afraid without that second viewing, I'll have to live with just a brief glimpse of what might or might not be a good film. But if you have the 2h:22m to do it all again, muster up some patience, make a pot of coffee, and take good notes (some help at 1h25m). And for you truly bold viewers out there, reading the book might help.

Let's start this off with a reward offering. I'll pay anyone $20 if they can explain to me, in detail, the full plot and synopsis of "Inherent Vice," front to back. That's a good place to start, eh?

The New York Film Festival press and audiences given the gift of a first look at Paul Thomas Anderson's hotly anticipated "Inherent Vice" starring Joaquin Phoenix and an all-star cast. Based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon, rumors flew about for months that the novel is a tough read and that the translation from book to film could be confusing in the hands of an auteur filmmaker like Anderson. Well, to a certain extent, they are absolutely correct. "Inherent Vice" is such a mind trip, one that will probably make you want to enroll in drug rehab by the end credits. What's amazing about it is even though you, nor I will probably "get it," and there's way more questions than answers at the moment, I cannot wait to revisit it again to start seeking those things out. You can see a little of Anderson's entire filmography.

Our "basic synopsis" is the story of Larry "Doc" Sportello, who in the 1970's, begins to search for his missing former girlfriend. The other things that accompany those facts, is a hallucination of laughs, satire, and magnificent filmmaking abilities.

Let's start with thanking the good Lord for Paul Thomas Anderson and his love of 35mm. Even though the screening did not show the film in that quality (the public screening however did), there's a charm that's still embedded within all of Anderson's film that pays homage to all the classic films of history. This is also partly thanks to Academy Award winning DP Robert Elswit, who can frame a scene to tension and success. Much like his past efforts such as "The Master," "There Will Be Blood," and "Boogie Nights," there's a magnitude of a visual master's exercises on display. He crafts provocative and engaging players that fully mesmerize you for its duration. 

On the top of his game, once again is the genius that is Joaquin Phoenix. He's hilarious, and nothing like "The Dude" as many will compare him. He's a three-dimensional character with layers, fully invested in the story, and best of all, utterly believable. In a quirky, detective mystery such as this, you expect some outrageous behavior that can sometimes run false. Call me crazy, I believed nearly all. Phoenix is pure, ludicrous, and keeps you fixated entirely. You couldn't ask for a more dependable thespian at this time in cinema. There's even a weird but obvious comparison to Freddie Quell, as if Freddie's illegitimate child got into drugs and missed out on the alcoholism.

The supporting players are as rich as any Anderson creation before. Finally back to large ensembles, where he has shined time and time again in films like "Magnolia," he assembles one of the strongest casts seen in 2014. Like a rock and roll star, Josh Brolin owns the stage with a savage and vicious dedication to his character, he stands out as one of the finest performances of the year. I adored him, and it might be his finest outing yet, and something that could ring him some much deserved awards attention. 

If you don't know her name yet, Katherine Waterston will be on the tongues of many for years to come. As Shasta Fay Hepworth, you'll find an enigmatic character with an entrancing and sensual aura. At times, feeling like a mixture of Rollergirl from "Boogie Nights" and Claudia Wilson Gator from "Magnolia," Waterston is one of engrossing and compelling characters of the year. It's an awards worthy performance, baring the soul of a performer that understands her purpose, Waterston is plain magnificent. 

You will get big chuckles from Benicio del Toro, Owen Wilson, and Martin Short, all of which make their mark. In one strong scene, Jena Malone leaves her mark while Michael Kenneth Williams could have set the screen on fire with more time than what he was given. Sasha Pieterse (fabulous as always), Reese Witherspoon (reminding us why we loved Johnny and June Cash together so much), Eric Roberts (yearning for a larger role at this time in his career), Joanna Newsom (our new female Morgan Freeman of this generation's narrators), and Maya Rudolph (who needs to team up with hubby more often), all shine.

Why the world isn't recognizing Jonny Greenwood as one of the most innovative and talented composers yet is beyond me. Once again, everything on-screen is elevated by his eerie composition and whimsical take on the 70's aura. Not to mention, the soundtrack may be THE album of the year. You can't tell me that you won't have that on repeat seconds after viewing. You also get a richly realized costume design by Mark Bridges and honest sets by David Crank and Amy Wells. It's a technical masterpiece for sure.

"Inherent Vice" is such a strange demon. Hard to say you love, if you don't comprehend it all yet, but with enough magic to keep coming back for more. It's one of the best offbeat and pecuilar monsters seen on screen this year, and you just might fall for its potent nature.

I saw this movie at the cinemas because it looked like an interesting detective mystery with old fashioned noir roots and intertwining plots and characters. These sort of films are among my favorite and it doesn't hurt that I am a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson to begin with. I personally look at him as being one of the more exemplary filmmakers of his time with classics such as Boogie Nights and Magnolia. His style is much like Scorsese's and his execution reminds me of Kubrick in many ways, cementing him in Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with. 

So you can imagine my disappointment when this film nearly bored me into a coma.

This film was so bad, that I not only walked out on it- reflecting on how I could have spent ten bucks on such drivel- but also wept at having wasted nearly 100 minutes of my life on absolute trash. Yes, that is right...100 minutes and this film seemed like it wasn't anywhere near the finish line. Just scene after scene after scene of some of the most boring, expository dialogue ever delivered by a million characters who have nothing to do with anything but talk about a plot that would require the viewer to trip out on DMT to even understand it. The structure makes no sense, the constant reminder that our main protagonist "Doc", a whacked out PI who never showers, is just a second rate version of "The Dude" from The Big Lebowski becomes very tedious, and that voice-over....why? And I thought Blake Lively's voice-over in "Savages" was bad. The voice-over in this movie did absolutely nothing for the meandering plot. It was nothing but a bunch of incoherent, pseudo- intellectual ramblings by a stoner hippie girl that grates your ears worse than a cheese grater. I always thought a voice-over should serve as sort of the icing on the cake. It should only accent the story, but with the viewer still able to comprehend what is going on even without it. If you want examples, watch any film by Scorsese. That's how you do it. This movie was just a train wreck. A 7.3 rating? I am still wondering how anyone who wasn't a doper of the 70s could call this an "entertaining movie". The only decent thing in this waste of celluloid is Josh Brolin's performance as the banana loving, wise cracking detective named Big Foot. However, one performance cannot save a pointless, never-ending drug fueled mess of a film.

Unfortunately Paul, you struck out this time. Absolutely terrible.

"I never remember the plots of movies. I remember how they make me feel."

- Paul Thomas Anderson, 10/5/2014, "On Cinema Masterclass", New York Film Festival

It's nearly impossible to talk about Inherent Vice, PTA's new stoner noir, without providing some context.

It's crucial to know, for example, that the film is an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel. It's also crucial to understand the novel's subject matter and setting: a sprawling conspiracy, which may or may not exist, that involves a real estate mogul, hippies, the LAPD, and a heroin cartel named the Golden Fang, all against the backdrop of Southern California in 1970, the year after the Manson Family Massacre. Some familiarity with Pynchon's literary output¬ñboth his prose style and unique narrative structure¬ñis helpful as well, almost required. Finally, to really grasp Inherent Vice, it'd be useful to know PTA's relationship with plot, which can best be understood by reading the quote above and thinking about the trajectory of his career (a career marked by films that have become more and more "plotless").

So, when we put all of this together, what do we get? To a large degree, we get exactly what we should have expected: a filmmaker creating a nearly-flawless adaptation of a nearly-impossible-to-adapt author. Wacky humor, a never ending stream of new characters (some of whom are neither introduced nor explained thoroughly), dialogue that sometimes feels like it's written in code, abrupt jumps between characters and scenes, unapologetically deep cultural references, long and wordy voice-overs, seemingly random occurrences that don't tie together, and a continual sense of paranoia that grows from the viewer (or reader's) inability to decipher what's real and what's imagined. Make no mistake, at the center of Inherent Vice is PTA's unyielding dedication to Pynchon's vision and his desire to put that vision, in full, on screen.

But, PTA's decision to remain so faithful to Pynchon's imagination comes with its faults. The only character we really feel invested in is Doc, the stoner, private eye protagonist played by Joaquin Phoenix (Phoenix is in almost every scene and deserves another Oscar nomination for his fantastic work). The other characters end up feeling peripheral, almost like they exist only to drive forward the narrative of Doc's detective search rather than exist as individual characters we should care about. Even Doc's love interest, Sashta, who shows up at Doc's house in the first scene and asks for a favor that sets in motion the goose chase at the heart of the film, is difficult to care about. Her presence in the film, while strong in certain moments, doesn't seem to stick because it's so ephemeral, dreamy, and enigmatic.

This is a flaw sometimes overlooked in novels (see DeLillo or Foster Wallace in addition to Pynchon), but it often distances viewers when done in films. More importantly, it's a criticism totally inapplicable to PTA's previous films. Boogie Nights and Magnolia also centered around ensemble casts, but in those films the viewer deeply cared about each and every character, whether it was Quiz Kid Donnie or pornographer-turned-speaker- salesmen Buck. The difference: PTA creating his own characters from scratch versus PTA capturing another artist's vision in uncompromising fashion.

It's also important to remember that many of Inherent Vice's viewers haven't read the book. I can't imagine how wild of a ride Inherent Vice will be for them. It'll certainly be a confusing experience, somewhere between trippy and surreal, almost Lynchian in its opaqueness and lack of narrative continuity. Perhaps it can best be summed up by the words of a girl who sat behind me at PTA's "On Cinema" talk at the New York Film Festival the day after Inherent Vice's world premiere: "It was good, but don't ask me to tell you what happened." This confusion and general inaccessibility will turn people off, much like The Master left some people enamored and others disappointed and unfulfilled.

Another important piece of context surrounding Inherent Vice, as always with highly anticipated films, is the prism of expectation. Many people predicted (and, I think, hoped) that Inherent Vice would be a return to form for PTA, a Boogie Nights Redux of some sort. They anticipated that the similarities between the films¬ñ1970's content, drugs, an ensemble cast¬ñwould unlock a time machine that catapulted us back to the earlier stages of PTA's career. Others, myself included, thought the film would split the difference between The Big Lebowski and L.A. Confidential, perfectly balancing the stoner laughs with tense and mystery-driven drama. These expectations were only furthered by Warner Brothers' decision to release a late and deceptively cut trailer, which I can only assume was a marketing decision made in reaction to The Master losing money at the box office.

But, the simple reality of PTA's films is that they are so good and so unique precisely because they can't be predicted. In that sense, Inherent Vice is no different. It's a ludicrously ambitious film crafted by a director who appears more interested in challenging himself as a filmmaker than anything else. It's a film that's long on dialogue but short on plot (shortest on plot of all PTA's films, which may shock some people, especially those who weren't fond of The Master). It's a film that, for two and a half hours, takes its viewer on a journey, leisurely meandering through a certain time and place, all while fluctuating in tone from romantic to paranoid to stoned. While Inherent Vice is neither what some thought it would be nor what many wanted it to be, it's exactly what it is, and more importantly, perhaps it's exactly what it had to be.

'Straightforward' is not a word I will use in this review to describe Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film Inherent Vice. Lying somewhere at the crossroads between a '70s neo-noir film and an absurdist stoner comedy, this neon-tinged detective story is two-and-a-half hours of increasingly absurd psychedelic mayhem. It's dense, confusing, chaotic, and absolutely riveting in its amorphous plotting and paranoid atmosphere.

Musician Joanna Newsom plays Sortil√®ge, the film's narrator and our guide through the hazy story of hippie-turned-private-detective Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). The story starts off simply enough, with Doc hired by his ex-girlfriend Shasta (Katherine Waterston) to locate her missing lover, but it all quickly spirals out of control into nearly a dozen different sub-plots featuring neo-Nazis, real estate, dentistry and everything in between.

As the first filmmaker to adapt a Thomas Pynchon novel to the screen, there was a great deal of pressure on Paul Thomas Anderson to successfully translate the source novel's complex prose into a relatively understandable film. Pynchon's work is known for featuring dozens upon dozens of characters involved in a variety of loosely connected plot lines, which makes it nearly impossible to faithfully adapt his novels. Of course, anyone who has seen Anderson's epic ensemble drama Magnolia can confirm that the director is more than capable of seamlessly interweaving countless characters and story lines, and in the case of Inherent Vice Anderson truly does an astounding job of packing so much dense material into a feature-length film. Although the plot is hardly comprehensible upon the first viewing, a second or third viewing reveals that, while intensely complex, the story is entirely coherent thanks to Anderson's clever, brilliantly- crafted script.

That comparison to Magnolia may be misleading, however, as Inherent Vice occupies a unique place in Paul Thomas Anderson's filmography. While Anderson has dabbled in comedy in the past, most notably with his dark rom-com Punch-Drunk Love, his humor has always been a cover for the far more deeply rooted melancholy that permeates all his films. While Inherent Vice's humor does take a backseat to the film's central mystery, it's nonetheless far brasher than that of any other PTA film. Anderson himself compared the film's comic timing to that of '80s screwball comedies Airplane! and The Naked Gun, a comparison that is uncharacteristic of his typical style to say the least. While it's surely more a neo-noir than a comedy, the film has more than enough laugh-out-loud moments to make it PTA's funniest movie to date, as well as a unique next step in his evolution as a director.

While Anderson's script does deserve its fair share of credit for the film's absurd humor, what really makes Inherent Vice so funny is the acting, especially that of Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin. Phoenix's portrayal of our perpetually stoned protagonist Doc is universally spot-on; with a wonderfully out-of-it expression frozen on his face, Doc stumbles through the movie dazed and confused in a marijuana-induced haze. The smallest details, such as Doc aggressively slapping himself in the face mid-conversation to focus, are what make his performance so consistently enjoyable. Brolin, meanwhile, steals the show as hippie-hating cop Christian "Bigfoot" Bj√∂rnsen, who both antagonizes and collaborates with Doc to unravel the film's tangled web of mysteries. Bigfooot's many idiosyncrasies, including the inadvertently suggestive way he eats frozen bananas and his not-quite-mastery of Japanese, make him by far one of the funniest and most colorful characters of the film, and Josh Brolin plays him with just the right mix of hotheadedness and cluelessness.

Despite Inherent Vice's one-of-a-kind style and atmosphere, it's still ultimately not going to work for a whole lot of people. It's virtually impossible to follow the plot the first time around, and its many subplots and manic storytelling style will surely frustrate and alienate many viewers. For those that can tolerate its eccentricities however, it's a rambling drug-fueled odyssey worth taking and, while it may not be his best work, yet another impressive showcase of Paul Thomas Anderson's incredible talent and versatility as a filmmaker.

Yeah, probably : under the paving stones, the beach. But we'll never know. The 60's are over, the dream is gone and the pavement which imprisons it is thick. Pynchon's vision and nostalgia are summed into this genius slogan from May 68 events in Paris. As for the movie, well, it is almost impossible to review. There's too much going on in. I thought it was the finest and most complex blend of comedy, drama, historical, cultural and political recalls I have seen in years. It is utterly funny if you do not mind not catching every bit of the plot. Some shots and most of the dialogues are truly beautiful, every single moment involving Shasta in particular. You will need to pay attention at the details, at what's going on in the background and offscreen. I can only urge you to go see it.

Inheret vice in a marine insurance policy is anything that you can't avoid. Eggs break, chocolate melts, glass shatters. And Doc wondered what that meant when it applied to ex-old ladies.

Inherent vice introduces us to drug-fueled, psychedelic, , ever-changing,70's LA and it's many interesting and interconnected characters. The movie has two main themes ¬ñ the strange disappearance of Mickey Z. Wolfmann, the local real estate big shot, and the never-ending appearance and doings of a mysterious organization known as the golden fang. 

Now, the first theme has a direct relation to our antagonist, stoner detective Larry 'Doc' Sportello, who's ex-old lady Shasta, who was at that point Mickey's old-lady, had also disappeared. From this point on every new client that comes through Doc's door seems to be somehow connected to the Wolfmann case. Moreover many leads start to be associated with the golden fang, that nobody quite knows anything about. On top of that, Lt. Bigbfoot Bjornssen and the LAPD appear to have a strange stake in the case too.

A nod to the dawn of the free spirited lifestyle of the 60's California, Inherent Vice is truly about something one can't avoid. For Doc it's Shasta Fay. With all of his stoner charm he acts as if in a dream, which always ends with Shasta. For Bigfoot it's the death of his partner and revenge. The renaissance detective has carefully navigated Doc in his own interest, starting from staging the disappearance of Mickey and ending with skillfully feeding Doc information about Prussia. For the golden fang ¬ñ it's something that ¬ñthey- can't avoid ¬ñ dominance, with a subtle reference to the rise of big corporations in the 70's. The golden fang is a heroin cartel that takes things full cycle ¬ñ they produce, transport (through their boat), distribute (Rudy Blatnoyd(s) and Puck Beaverton(s)), and their biggest front is the institution where such addicts (Coy Harlingten) get brainwashed (Japonica) and institutionalized before they can go out on the streets and score some more ¬ñ the full cycle.

The interesting part is to really think about what moves and motivates Doc. Is it Shasta? Is Doc just genuinely a good person? He ends up helping Coy and Hope in the end without keeping any money to himself, neither does he seems to be really angry at Bigfoot. And this is the beautiful mystery of Inherent Vice, it's none of these reasons, it's just the scene, something Doc can't avoid. Like in a spider web the series of events seem to suck Doc in before he even knows it. 

Most importantly Inherent Vice is about a gradual end of the free-spirited-piece-and-love era that were the 60's. Hippies are becoming increasingly more suspicious and the bureaucracy is slowly taking hold. Law enforcement are constantly thirsty for blood. We are allowed to witness this decline first-hand through a number of hilarious and vivid characters, Doc's doped out eyes and Newsom's cotton voice. 

With John Greenwood's remarkable, moody soundtrack, PTA beautifully guides us through this inevitable change, which no one can reinforce, much like Inherent Vice itself.

"Inherent Vice" is the first outright comedy that Paul Thomas Anderson has made and it's only the second film he's made based on someone else's work, (in this case Thomas Pynchon, whose dialogue he has faithfully reproduced). Consequently the film has been somewhat side-lined and underrated so while it may not be "Magnolia", "There Will Be Blood" or "The Master" it is still head and shoulders above anything else out there at the moment. The plot may be virtually impenetrable, (but then who gives a toss about plot these days), yet as a snapshot of a drug-fueled LA in 1970 this is close to priceless. If Anderson was Altman in a previous life then this is his "The Long Goodbye" by way of Howard Hawks' "The Big Sleep".

When I said the plot was impenetrable I think I should have said it was more or less irrelevant since it is easily summed up in the opening and then conveniently disappears down a rabbit-hole. 'Doc', (a terrific Joaquin Phoenix), is a spaced-out PI 'hired' by former girl-friend Shasta, (newcomer Katherine Waterston), to track down missing billionaire Michael Wolfmann, (Eric Roberts), whom she believes has been kidnapped by his own wife. He isn't very far into the investigation when he wakes up beside a corpse and finds himself surrounded by the fuzz, chief among whom is one Bigfoot Bjornsen, (a never better Josh Brolin). After that you really need to pay very close attention or just go with the flow as more and more characters slip in and out of the frame and an organization called 'The Golden Fang' begins to loom large. Oh, and I did mention this was a comedy and a very funny one, too. It's the kind of surreal, psychedelic comedy movies don't do these days and in that respect it's another throwback to independent Ameriican movie-making in the seventies.

As well as Phoenix and Brolin, both at the top of their game, there is Reese Witherspoon as a promiscuous Assistant DA, an amazing Martin Short as a very peculiar dentist, (and on screen for much too short a time), Owen Wilson as some kind of whistle-blower, (at least I guessed that was what he was), not to mention cameos from the likes of Jeannie Berlin and Jefferson Mays. It's a fun film though it might confound Anderson devotees and anyone who thought him incapable of doing anything other than "The Master" or "Magnolia" and, of course, it looks the part. As well as being a great writer, Anderson has always been a great visual stylist and here DoP Robert Elswit imbues the film with a Vilmos Zsigmond hue. Yes, this is a film that isn't just set in 1970 but which could have been made then, too. It may not be Anderson's best work but it is absolutely essential nevertheless.

When my friends and I went to the cinema just a few days ago, we didn't know what to expect. I, at least, had heard about Pynchon and knew what kind of an author he was, while my friends, on the other hand, had absolutely no way of knowing what they were getting themselves into. The movie started playing, and for a little while we weren't quite sure what to think. It took some time for us to get into the atmosphere and understand what we were actually dealing with here. Once we got it, we just started laughing. We fell silent. We laughed. And we kept on laughing throughout the film. And when I left the cinema and walked out on the street and took the train home and went to bed, I kept laughing to my self in the darkness. What was I laughing at? I'm not sure, but God damn was it funny. The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the music, the endless amount of new characters, everything about this movie makes a lasting impression. It is a movie in which every scene is memorable. And a movie you can keep on quoting again and again and again for ages with your friends, and still laugh about it. Rather elegantly it avoids jokes of poor taste, and focuses instead on a kind of black humor that will remind you of another time and another place, probably long before you were born. It's not for everyone, I'll admit that. Some people may not like it, and that's OK. But I reckon that this movie will be watched for years by a small but dedicated following. I won't be telling anything about the plot. You'll have to experience that for yourself. So all in all. The humor, the wit, the elegance, in my opinion this movie is an instant cult classic.

Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the few auteurs left in Hollywood. He gets to do what he desires, which makes me very happy. "Inherent Vice" is like no other film that came out in 2014. It can't even be compared to Oscar-bait movies like "The imitation game" or "The theory of everything" (who I by the way have trouble separating).

What the film focuses most on is the atmosphere, like most great films. It's not really about the story, in fact the story gets harder and harder to follow as the film progresses, but that's not the point. The atmosphere creates this strange feeling inside of you and you get caught up with the character's relationships with each other and the strange situations surrounding them. It's a movie to re-watch (like most of Andersons movies).

"Inherent Vice" is hysterically funny. There aren't that many jokes, but the situations themselves are incredibly funny. Much of the films humor comes out of Joaquin Phoenix's performance. And of course I can't forget about Josh Brolin, he is outrageous in this. The cast overall did a terrific job.

I think "Inherent Vice" is a huge step forward from Andersons last movie "The Master". It's more playful, atmospheric, thematic. 

Don't go into the cinema expecting anything normal that you can just watch to pass the time, expect something unique and something a bit too puzzling. It's not a movie that you can take a leak during. 

I haven't read the book, and I probably won't, because I find the film just so vivid and entertaining, I don't feel the urge to. Paul Thomas Anderson challenges the way of mainstream filmmaking, and even though this film probably won't achieve either award-success nor audience-acclaim, I think it should. Well done, Mr. Anderson!

Now the thing about this film is, it's great. I stood in line for over 2hrs just to see this movie and wow what a pay off! This movie does few things movies do these days and that is be itself. It's this semi-ground breaking cinema that shows Paul Thomas Anderson is not scared to have fun and be serious at the same time and doesn't need to play it safe or do what you expect at the movies and neither is the original writer of the book Thomas Pynchon and boy are they a match! Now most people who see this film and those who won't like it are the same people that probably don't like or have even really read Pynchon, so let's forget about them and accept this for what it is a great film based on a good book by an amazing author. Joaquin phoenix is perfect as Larry Doc Sportello a stoner detective looking into the kidnappers of his ex-girls beau and real estate tycoon Mikey Wolfmann they both apparently just go missing and this leads Doc to a very many colorful character semi stereotypes of the 1960-1970's Era which all seem to center around something known as the golden fang what it is couldn't tell you, but what's apparent in this movie is the dying of a culture and all the things that go in between in late capitalism. Once when there was hope and promise once again now there is greed and control,the film is very deep and sad and romantic in this sense and the fact that no one saw it coming because they were all caught up and confused in smoky haze (as we in the audience are) it's sad because they are losing these hopes and promises, "lost sight of" maybe because of certain vices and only have to look forward to a grim future is what makes this films emotional center. The film kinda takes on the same dimensions as Doc's regular weed habits the funny bits are truly great, Phoenix is great at physical comedy him and Brolin are meant for each other and the other cast members just shine the few minutes when they are on screen honorable mention is Martian Short boy is he wild in this one! All in all this is the best I've seen all year this one defiantly takes some time and repeated viewings but like all great films There Will Be Blood included is worth the effort.

Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. Weird, hard to follow and just just too odd! No risk of a spoiler here, I literally couldn't tell you what happened! Made no sense and didn't hold my interest whatsoever. In fact, this film so bad I'm writing this review before it has even finished! If you're thinking about watching this, don't waste your time. That's 2 hours ish (which felt much longer) of my life that I'll never get back. Plus a waste of ¬£4.99 in rental! !! Now, to add to my evening of frustration, I've spent ten mins ( due to website glitches) registering for IMDb to warn you off and tell the world how I feel about this film, only to be told that I can not submit any review which contains 'less than 10 lines of text'. What is all that about? I've said what I want to say and have heard of text limitations but not text minimums! ... Okay, have I written enough to submit yet?!

I haven't read a single line of Thomas Pynchons prose thus far. But after watching Paul Thomas Andersons sublime work based on one of his books, I must say, it would be a sad state of affairs to leave this world without having read some of Mr. Pynchon's words.

This weird tale of corruption, sex, greed, counter-culture and lost chances may rank among the finest recreations of the much epitomized sixties in America. During it's entire running time I had to think about "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" more than once. "Inherent Vice" seems to be strangely connected to Hunter S. Thompsons work and Terry Gilliam's adaption, which also showed the afterglow of this decade of idealism. And both movies star Benicio Del Toro as a lawyer.

Within the plot of a detective story lies a very touching core concerning ¬Ña generation of thrill-seekers" as Thompson wrote, who were ready for everything except some sort of real intimacy. 

The acting is as perfect as can be, and the production design, sound, camera-work are as it has become a trademark of the director and his collaborators, specific and fully realized.

So, after having heralded the obvious, there's one last note to be made. The movie smoothly glides through 1970 Los Angeles in the wake of those societal changes and left this viewer who was not even alive back then, with a deep sense of regret. The atmosphere that "Inherent Vice" exudes is druggy, surreal and yet strangely tied to all the unanswered questions and real tragedies (Altamont, the Manson Murders etc.) that made the revolution come to a screeching halt. What was left were the drugs, some glorious memories but also a feeling of distance. As much as there was a sexual and intellectual liberation, it seems those ¬Ñthrill-seekers" were unable to commit to something tangible. To commit wouldn't have been hip, and to be square meant to be dead. And by evoking such thoughts and emotions, the movie delves into something inherently human and therefore something truly precious.

I have enjoyed Paul Thomas Anderson's previous cinematic outings, but this one was a beautifully filmed incoherent mess that simply fails to engage the audience.

Don't be fooled by the other reviews: this is NOT a companion film to The Big Lebowski, which, unlike this one, is actually a film that has a coherent and engaging narrative.

It seems to me that the positive reviews of this movie are built on two problematic justifications:

1. The drug taking element of the plot should be considered a justification for the confusing, uninteresting and incoherent way the film is put together.

The problem is that this is not how filmmaking is meant to work - and movies like The Big Lebowski are testament to the fact that visual storytelling and narrative are not meant to go out the window just because drug taking is a major element of the plot.

2. The suggestion that you need to read the novel the film is based on in order to understand the movie.

Once again, that's not how filmmaking is meant to work.

The film is meant to be an adaption of the book that is accessible, in a standalone fashion, to people who encounter the story solely through the medium of cinema.

If your audience needs to do supplemental reading - in this case, the entire book the film is an adaptation of - then the filmmaker has failed at filmmaking 101, which is supposed to be about creating a cinematic version of the source material, not some sort of filmed addition to the original work that is incoherent as a standalone artwork.

Just in case you're wondering, the reason I gave it 4 stars was because the cinematography here is up to Paul Thomas Anderson's usual high standards even if the storytelling isn't.

Those who don't get it, will never get. Those who do get it, will have a ball. Inherent Vice is the most psychedelic film since Robert Downey Sr.'s "Putney Swope". It doesn't make sense.... It's really not supposed to make sense. It's delightfully confusing and eclectically bewildered in the fumes of it's own bong water. This isn't the same P.T.A. you knew from "Boogie Nights" and "There Will Be Blood". Here, he slams down on our heads a Thomas Pynchon book, and laughs at us for not getting it. It's a delicious assault on filmmaking. It's also a genius, loving tribute to the end of the Hippie revolution of America in the early 1970's. It may never win an Oscar, but it ought to be tried for the Palme D'or at Cannes. Uncompromisingly, I loved it.

Inherent Vice just doesn't give a f@#k. I don't mean that as anything more than an observation, and understand this as you watch the film because otherwise you'll be a little lost. The film just doesn't care whether you think this or that is good acting or a funny joke. It doesn't care what you think is happening. It will go on. Despite any perceived awkwardness, it will continue to be itself... and there is awkwardness.

Fortunately, "itself" is absolutely beautiful. P.T. Anderson has mastered that Jacques Tati style wide angle and mixes it in with his earlier Boogie Nights fluidity for a confusing and awesome new style. He's done this before, of course, (The Master) but this time is pretty different. You'll notice it the moment that beautiful first shot appears. While I'm at it, I should mention the cinematography. There are colors in this film that I never thought I'd see again.

From a story telling perspective, Inherent Vice almost seems like a Terrence Malick movie at some points. The narrator comes in and out like hypnosis and there's this air of evil always lurking behind all that beauty. There's love too, and the ultimate message, if you can call it that, falls within the great rule of pop: it's best when it's bittersweet.

After the huge disappointment I took with The Master, director and screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson redeems himself with Inherent Vice, an unusual hybrid of classic "noir" and "head movie" which challenges expectations and gradually involves us into the clich√©s from both styles, which are somehow transformed into something fresh and fascinating. In the context of Anderson's filmography, Inherent Vice can be considered a complement of Boogie Nights, whose tribute to the '80s was as detailed and complex as the one Inherent Vice makes to the '70s; but in this occasion, the characters are involved in an even more tangled and confusing story... and even like that, it's perfectly clear if we carefully follow the investigation (and accept the methods) of a detective impulsed by love and marijuana, and who is not afraid of employing "alternative" sources of information, such as an ouija and a postcard which revives old memories of a romantic moment with his ex- girlfriend. That's the general tone of Inherent Vice... a cloudy "high" in the sunny coast of California, interrupted by bizarre character who get in and out the story with additional information which gradually outlines the surroundings of a big conspiracy. I also have to say that we will never find a clear explanation of the events investigated by the main character; but it's relatively easy to deduct the necessary if we pay the corresponding attention to the cryptic comments and incongruent scenes we find, which are usually filtered through the sensory cloud from the eternally drugged detective. Regarding the "noir" part, Inherent Vice shares the tone and structure of such influential films as The Big Sleep and The Third Man, including femme fatales, missing tycoons and a tough policeman who is against the main character's diffuse methods, despite chasing the same truth. Joaquin Phoenix brings a perfect performance as the "stoner" detective, and he has a wonderful chemistry with Josh Brolin, who also makes an excellent work as the tough and intolerant policeman who is proud of his violations to civil rights, because the "hippies" don't deserve to enjoy them. It would take too much space to mention all the actors who leave an important mark in the film despite having a limited screen time; so, I will just say that they all make a brilliant work in their roles, highlighting Martin Short and Owen Wilson. And a very special mention to Joanna Newsom as the omnipresent narrator whose sweet voice perfectly contrasts with the rough jargon similar to authors such as Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. In conclusion, I liked Inherent Vice very much, but I understand the fact that its affected style and tangled screenplay will divide the audience and leave away those spectators who were seeking a more "normal" detective story, or a funnier comedy in the traditional sense. But, in my personal case, Inherent Vice was a fascinating experience, and I left the cinema with a smile which accompanies the "buzz" this film transmits after intoxicating us through the view of a world which exists half in dreams and half in reality.

Wow!Just finished watching Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film "Inherent Vice" and thought it was incredible!At it's heart it's a 70's film noir that captures the spirit and feel of the 70's perfectly but in it's whole it is sooo much more than that.It's a rumble tumble roller coaster of a watch that whilst conveying a sense of the main protagonists tenuous drug fuelled grasp on what is going on still manages to maintain a coherent narrative right to the end.It's got elements of classic film noir,70's counter culture movies (the voice over reminds me both of classic noir and the radio station from "Vanishing Point"),70's "cinema of the paranoid" and dashes of "The Big Lebowski".All the while there's an underlying religious parable, (that I think I'm gonna have to watch it again to fully grasp what he was getting at) with one image in particular mirroring "The Last Supper", themes of resurrection and many other little references and images relating to Christian dogma.To top it all off one character virtually transforms into a metaphor for "the man" (which he always was throughout the film but it's just more blatant in the scene I'm referring to) without it seeming clumsy or forced.Oh god.Love,love loved this film!

Underrated. That's the first word that springs to my mind when I think of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest mystery cum comedy epic masterpiece. There are many adjectives to describe 'Inherent Vice'; tragic, hilarious, enticing, sexual and magnificent. Yet they do not do the film justice. This is one to watch on the big screen for sure in all its colourful glory.

We are drawn into the film from the off, and are transported to the groovy seventies where everyone is either tripping out or making love. Joaquin Phoenix plays the eccentric Doc a private investigator and part time pot head. His ex-lover Shasta Fey Hepworth played by Katherine Waterstone with sexiness and charm asks him for a favour, he must investigate the eluding Mickey Wolfmann. What follows is a cascade of confusing, illuminating and ultimately wondrous scenes, all of which make up a grand whole.

Phoenix undoubtedly gives us a performance like no other. He is always fun to watch and lights up the screen whenever he appears. From the way his character moves to how he interacts with others he bedazzles us and effortlessly. It's almost as if this is an actual person, the way he embodies his characters innate quirkiness.

You may be curious as to whether the supporting players are noteworthy and they all are. From the brutish Josh Brolin playing a police cop to the stoned laid back Jena Malone all of them bring something together. They make this fascinating tale fell real and grounded which is exceptional given that the further the film unravels the more the audience begins to feel that they are high. If I was to just talk about other characters then my review would be never ending ¬ñ they are that well realised.

Now, many have taken issue with the films storyline. The further that Doc embarks on his quest the more confusing all the plot points become. But Paul Thomas Anderson is aware of this fact and he takes it into consideration. Later in the film we see Doc filling out a white board with all the separate names and connections. He stares at it in bewilderment, just like the audience trying to explain the plot to a friend. But do not fear this mind boggling plot has a purpose. You can never second guess the film and it always keeps you on your toes. Surely this is the essence of cinema? Everyone that worked on the film must have realised that they have crafted something that will be talked about for years, scratch that decades to come. It is very close to other hardboiled detective stories like 'The Big Sleep', but this is deliriously entertaining for audience members of practically any age from teenagers to adults. It also means that to re-watch the film is to gain further understanding of it. The fact that this film is in a haze of smoke only adds to its grand scale.

For a film just shy of 150 minutes it never feels bloated or unnecessary, all of the scenes lead to somewhere. Whether that be one of the funniest scenes in the film. As Doc remarks to one guy 'Does that man have a swastika on his head'? To which he replies 'It isn't. It is an ancient Hindu symbol meaning that all is well'. I do not remember laughing this much for a long time.

For fans of Paul Thomas Anderson it will come as no surprise that the film looks awesome. Whether that be the neon glow of green from signs or the over saturated orange faces, the colours leap off of the screen. Dare I say it gave me joyous celebration enough to feel like a six year old who had just been handed crayons and a drawing pad. Just like 'A Most Violent Year' perfectly captured the dark look of the eighties, 'Inherent Vice' translates the seventies to the screen with mesmerizing results. If only I had a time machine.

The soundtrack only adds to the sense of fun which the screen offers by the barrel load. Almost anyone anywhere in need of a good time and high entertainment value would be a fool to miss 'Inherent Vice'.

Paul Thomas Anderson has woven a seamless, energetic if not entirely understandable film into a masterwork of art and beauty. Even if we are confused at least it gives us more reason to come back to the film time and time again why should we not be thankful? The screen shines brightest with Phoenix at the helm, supporting characters and even Reese Witherspoon are true acting talent to be reckoned with and the cinematography will leave you drooling for more. It has to be said that this is the most stunning film I have seen from the twenty first century. The script is witty and devoted with loving care, the music turns the cinema into a disco and most importantly the film always intrigues and never ever thinks of the audience as dumb. If you do not have the time of your life with 'Inherent Vice' then you may have to reconsider whether you have had any fun in your life at all.
