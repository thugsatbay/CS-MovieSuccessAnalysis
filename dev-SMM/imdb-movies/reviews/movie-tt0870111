### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
A remarkable performance by Frank Langella as Richard Nixon transforms this unexpected Ron Howard film into a gripping and unforgettable experience. The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon/Langella thinking. It was difficult to forget that Michael Sheen was not Tony Blair but David Frost. Sheen's Frost is an entertaining foil to Langella's somber,sad, desolate portrait of the former president. Ron Howard finds a winning pace giving the true tale a fictional slant. Unfortunately I never saw the stage production and the film never betrays its theatrical origins. In a bizarre sort of way this is Ron Howard's most cinematic film. I highly recommend it.

The Frost/Nixon interviews are fascinating. Not every second of them, especially not when Nixon rambles on and on, avoiding questions by offering anecdotes in place of answers. Yet, they are an invaluable historical document, which allow us the rare privilege of seeing a major politician as a human being and nothing else. As interesting as the interviews themselves is the lead-up to them, the circumstances surrounding them, and the characters involved, particularly Frost and Nixon, of course. One could say that you only need to watch the actual footage, but there's ample room for a great dramatization, but it needed an even-handed approach, and certainly needed no political preaching.

I have a personal dislike for Ron Howard as a director, a result of my sensibilities mainly, I suspect. Howard strikes me as a particularly heavy-handed, didactic director who has wasted many great concepts on mediocre films (out of 18 films I've seen by him, I only genuinely liked "Apollo 13". I was expecting the worst with "Frost/Nixon", but instead was met with one of the most entertaining films in a while, and a remarkably well-acted, even-handed, quality character study. I suppose I should have been prepared for a quality screenplay given the success of this Peter Morgan play in New York and London, but I was hardly expecting something this good. It's glib, funny, well-paced, expertly-structured, clever, observant, and intelligent. It creates a fascinating Nixon, played brilliantly by the great Frank Langella, though this is not quite up there with the likes of Oliver Stone's sadly under-appreciated "Nixon" or Robert Altman's endlessly fascinating "Secret Honor". The film is almost surprisingly well-directed, although there is a bit of the old TV trick of shaking the camera a bit, panning too often, to give the illusion of motion and energy when there's really just people in a room talking. The conversation's interesting enough, there's no need for that. Oh well, I suppose I am nitpicking.

As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes (which are truly, truly excellent), Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all, the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism, but overall the nature of the script works in its favor, makes those scenes more interesting, more ultimately rewarding.

"Frost/Nixon" is an entertaining, exciting film, around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of, particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding, both manage to accurately portray the real-life men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tony-award winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon, but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavy-handedness, no political 'messages', just a fun, clever script and a great cast in a well-made film.

It didn't seem so in the run-up to the event, but British talk show host/interviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon was great, historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably, the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747, Nixon's "smart" seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente, and the impressive, downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering, dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks; and Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall), the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character, and the "monkey suit" blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier; we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version, both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy, aggression, and self-pity; Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted, hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.

It's important that the fakery should work well, because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works, the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film, and the actors don't have to yell. The camera, sometimes annoyingly jerky, but in the best moments simply direct and relentless, does their yelling for them.

So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay, and he's no stranger to such efforts--notable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen; a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts, till it gets to Watergate in the fourth, Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to prevent an abject breakdown, Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality, and there is the question: does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary, Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar (Toby Jones) to get $600,000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.

The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too, but he let Nicon play him with small talk (despite the man's claim that he was no good at it) and temporize with lengthy self-serving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter, jubilant at first, pathetic at the end.

Ultimately both in the play and the film, Frost's victory seems a hollow one, of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena, this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way, he was losing every sponsor, and later he lost his Australian show, having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back, and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television, but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be "worth Â£20 million," with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead, and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews, his legacy is tainted.

The show belongs to Sheen and Langella, but Bacon is excellent as the stiff, loyal Col. Brennan, and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat, the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors, far more than in the stage production, and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's ocean-side estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version, but they were groundless.

I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was "Tricky Dickey's" playground.

The acting duo of Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen (Nixon & Frost) are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language, pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed, the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life (read intimacy) into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.

Make no mistake, this is by no means a two man show, quite the contrary. In fact, the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould, Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who, brick by brick, constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.

Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan, who has, without question, penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history, but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.

Not to be missed, this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.

It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling "what will happen" drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.

This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance, but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director Â he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference Â the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.

For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film Â one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.

For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.

Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.

Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role Â instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.

I thoroughly recommend this film.

Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play (who also scripted and co-produced here) dramatizes the famous Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film, Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on "Nixon the man". To which Nixon retorted, "As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?" Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews, the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandal--straight from the horse's mouth.

Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with "The Queen", he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost word-for-word dramatization of said event. Also, like "The Queen", we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board, who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talk-show host and man-about-town David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage, faux-post interviews with the secondary players, and the dramatic reenactments of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going, the final interview where Frost takes Nixon head-on about the Watergate cover-up is a payoff well worth the wait.

Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance, and the way it connects with the audience, is wonderfully layered. On one level, we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering close-up after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering close-up on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual close-up they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense, Langella truly became Nixon, and his performance will not soon be forgotten.

Frost/Nixon is one of the best film of the year, and certainly a strong contender for best picture. Langella's marvelous performance as the bedazzled Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen's terrific portrayal of the rigorous David Frost combined with Ron Howard's magnificent direction make the movie a memorable one. Not only that but the supporting cast- including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Matthew MacFayden and Olvier Platt- was also phenomenal. Frost/Nixon is an epic, an epic that involves not guns and human sacrifices but words and tense emotions. It's also a historically significant film, for all who crave to know what really happened and whether or not Nixon didn't "obstruct any laws." In short Frost/Nixon is an amazing film filled with sharp dialogues, amazing performances and tense and provocative sentiments as well as an explosive yet subtle ending.

10/10 Go see it!

I almost skipped "Frost/Nixon," and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.

My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).

Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.

The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of "The Last King of Scotland" and "The Queen") engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.

Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.

I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching "Frost/Nixon": even if some future film "humanizes" (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen.

Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is truly moving in this remarkable film by Ron Howard, which gripped me for its entirety. As someone who grew up during the Watergate hearings, and who reviled Nixon as the embodiment not just of corruption but of the worst kind of interventionist, even genocidal, American politics, this film gives substance to a man who, in later years (especially the GW Bush years, which make Nixon look like a political and intellectual colossus), achieved something of a place in history beyond the scandal of Watergate.

But what Frost/Nixon - and in particular Langella - does is give humanity to the man. We see his arrogance, his love of power, his need to win (hinted at wonderfully in a moment when he is jogging in his San Clemente home to rousing music), but we also see his inner conflicts, his regrets, the fact that perhaps more than simply his crimes regarding Watergate haunted him - that the impact of his decisions on South East Asia were not entirely remote from him, either. And in a sequence that I will not reveal, to avoid spoiling the plot, we also see a hint of his madness, for it is that, I think, rather than senility. (You have to see it to understand this.)

Ron Howard and playwright/screenwriter Peter Morgan have achieved a remarkable feat in adapting the stage play, which sadly I did not see. Not for a moment does this feel stage bound; instead it is a compelling human portrait of two men - for Frost is fascinating, too, and Michael Sheen captures both his much criticized (at the time) surface gloss and also his deeper fears - but above all of the impact that each of our decisions, large and small, and not least if you are leader of the "Free World," have on us all.

Frost/Nixon was indeed a good movie but the question is "will it stand the test of time?". I seriously doubt it. The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.

The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with, I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.

The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy, it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.

I liked Frost/Nixon but it is not a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture, best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year.

I had never seen the real interview between Frost and Nixon and so came into this movie totally fresh. The story is engaging, the script enjoyable and the acting fine. At the end though, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a "he said it!!" moment.

The film implied that Frost had gotten Nixon to admit to something no-one else could (i.e. something illegal), thereby condemning himself to political wilderness. However, instead I was left feeling that Nixon was an OK guy - an intelligent, quick witted, sincere and strong guy who did what it took to get things done. Whereas Frost came across as a chancer, who was a bit lucky. At the end I wondered what the purpose of the movie was.

I have now seen the actual footage of the interviews and can only conclude that the movie's purpose was to show Nixon in a much more favourable light than he would've come across in the real interviews - because in the real interviews, he stinks. In the real interviews you can see the panic in his face, you can see the often painfully contrived shows of friendliness in his mannerisms and you can hear the uncoordinated logic of his answers. Whereas in the movie he's smooth with his answers and his mannerisms.

Any Brits out there should liken Nixon to our very own Gordon Brown - a man as bereft of any social attractiveness as Nixon. By getting Langella to play Nixon, it's like getting Alec Guiness to play Brown. I.e. a brilliant actor, but a million miles away from the truth.

And THAT'S the problem with these recent "real life" movies that focus on people in high offices of state - The Queen, The Special Relationship and now Frost/Nixon. The films make the people in high office appear to be totally articulate, very quick witted, sincere, at times funny and always strong in character and determination. Whereas the truth is anything but that. We've seen footage of a supposedly eloquent Clinton and he is anything but. We've seen the Queen deliver her speeches and "sincerity" is never a word you'd associate with her.

I know the counter argument is that it is only a movie and we shouldn't take it literally. But that's just it, by giving the film "real" characters and "real story" lines, the film makers are implying it is real. In fact, it is the very suggestion that it might be factual that draws the audiences in. Otherwise where would the attraction be of seeing a film about a fictional President's relationship with a fictional Prime Minster? Or a fictional queen's reaction to the death of a fictional daughter in law? There would be no attraction. So the makers have lured us paying public to part with our hard earned cash to see something that promises fact but instead delivers fiction.

So yes, I enjoyed the "story", but ended up resenting its total fiction.

The morning after the Watergate break-in, I brought the newspaper to my university, showing the brief article to everyone who would look. "Tricky Dick is at the bottom of this" I insistedÂ"NO! He wouldn't be that STUPID!" most of them replied.

In FROST/NIXON we get an insightful look at a gifted, multi-faceted, conflicted personality in all its haunting glory. Nixon was many things. Stupid was not one of them. A Ron Howard Movie about a TV interview? I was very skeptical, to say the least. One viewing made me a believer. Ron Howard has crafted an instant Classic masterpiece. Ripe with couched metaphors and subtle tripwire dialog, the film's power flows from Ron Howard's ability to present us with the cinematic equivalent of a 100 minute TV close-up of its title characters.

FROST/NIXON turns a microscope on both Nixon's strengths and a shopping list of inner demons. Simultaneously vindictive, petty, rancorous, insecure and ever ready to play the victim, more than anything else, Frank Langella's uncanny performance evokes not hatred, but great pathos. History is replete with flawed geniuses. But only during the past half century has there been a media obsessed with exposing them for the entire world to see.

Michael Sheen is inspired as David Frost, undergoing a great on screen catharsis. And the re-creation of the interviews is sublime! Cleverly and convincingly Presented as two deftly talented sparring partners, FROST/NIXON is an immensely entertaining/informative slice of history that should satisfy even the most discerning cinematic gourmet.

There's a brief but memorable moment in "Frost/Nixon" where one of Nixon's most ardent haters, a researcher played by Sam Rockwell, is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet, despite a brief hesitation, he gives both hand and respect. That says it all, there's the politician, there's the man, and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.

No one can resist it, much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media -which is the film's essential theme- I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people, something will cease to be natural, and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So, when Frost (Michael Sheen) decides to interview Nixon, with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer, he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon (Frank Langella) advised by Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) accepts the challenge, a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.

It all comes to this : either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation, the only one in History, or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt (Matthew McFayden), Bob Zelnick, a TV journalist (Oliver Platt) and James Reston, Jr. (Rockwell) expect from the interview, anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges, the premises could be that of a boxing match. And "Frost/Nixon" is indeed a duel (the slash is relevant) with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos, starting with Frost, a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows, the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.

But Nixon plays in another league, being the epitome of 'unpopular culture', a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams, including his own. In 1995, Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon, with no concession. Still, we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now, I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself, ambivalent to the best, with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'larger-than-life' President. Anyway, he's not an amateur and during the interview, he's like Goliath ready to frost David.

Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable right-hand man (Kevin Bacon) who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV, he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960, so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview (we might as well call it a round) starts, Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate "why didn't you burn the files?" Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut, Frost was literally knocked down, tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers, we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment, before he could recover.

The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win, yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a dead-end and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome, and by throwing himself in that crazy project, Frost lost his show, 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career, maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend, Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks, she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview, destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed, the two men bet a lot in this interview, and it's like two destinies crossing one another.

The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon, one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process, on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots, or use his adversary's weapons against him, not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once, the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close, yet so different from each other.

It is between the two men and the others are only spectators, filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match, and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men, and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes, truth hurts, but how relieving it can also be!

What I am about to say may sound a little mean. However, until recently I never took Frank Langella all that seriously as an actor. With film credits like "And God Created Woman" (1988), "Masters of the Universe" and "The 12 Chairs", I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However, here in "Frost/Nixon" he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wrong--he is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderful--especially when it COULD have come off as a parody--like Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But, he was able to capture the man very well--and, provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.

As for Michael Sheen, who co-starred and played David Frost, he was excellent as well--but he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon character--even if they dislike him.

As for the movie, it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me, I'm a retired history teacher, so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned, I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So, when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the cover-up are discussed, it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this, reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.

Looking at the film's box office receipts, I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all, the acting and writing certainly were not at issue--they were top-notch. And, I must also admit, the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies (you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end, but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd). An amazingly good film.

Peter Morgan adapted his wonderful stage play Frost/Nixon for film with tremendous success. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of the famous series of interviews.

For all many of us who lived through the Nixon presidency and Watergate, this is not the stuff of nostalgia or happy reminiscence. And when the Nixon tapes were published and his bigotry against just about everyone was revealed in explicit "expletive deleted" language, it was time to get disgusted all over again.

Here, portrayed by Frank Langella, we see Nixon as a lonely, vulnerable, angry, and bitter human being, a man who's made a bed he must sleep in for the next twenty years. We also see a manipulative and highly intelligent individual who, despite a great deal of success, had no self-worth. It's the feeling of being an outsider, of never being good enough, that led him to some atrocious decisions.

It's Langella's performance and Michael Sheen's wonderful performance as David Frost -- playboy, comedian, talk show host, and party-giver turned investigative journalist -- that anchor "Frost/Nixon." They are given great support by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's protective assistant, Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston, determined that Nixon pay for Watergate, as well as Oliver Platt, Matthew Mcfadyen, and Toby Jones.

I found the determination of Frost as he attempted to raise financing for the interviews and get networks interested -- with no luck -- very admirable and inspiring. And his gut instinct paid off for him big time.

I transcribed an interview with Nixon that took place in his home in the 1980s, as well as a speech he made during one of the Presidential election periods. He was a brilliant speaker, and as an interviewee, when the interview was over, he engaged the reporter in a very friendly personal conversation. In the end, both those listening experiences made me sad, as did this film. For everything he achieved, Richard Nixon had undeveloped gifts and potential. He robbed the world of a lot more than the ability to trust government. But in the end, as the film shows, he robbed himself the most.

Nixon might had lied countless times but this film doesn't, except for some artistic license or other that is necessary to make the story more spicy or to fill a drama and tension that might have never existed during the famous Frost/Nixon interview. 

Ron Howard directs "Frost/Nixon" a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television, and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and English TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen) after the President's impeachment. This meeting will be just like a long awaited boxing match between two heavyweights and it will take all of their power, intelligence and courage to make of this event something memorable and it will be memorable. Behind these two fearless men there's a great team assisting, played by Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew McFayden, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones.

Transforming a play of success into a film is a very difficult job but writer Peter Morgan adapted it perfectly, with wonderful dialogs exchange between Sheen and Langella and all the actors, balancing drama, comedy, heated discussions, and of course, using quotes of the real interview, one of the most successful events ever presented on TV, very historical. 

Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides, a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician, always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons, face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field (a serious interview with a former president) where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career, his reputation, but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments. The supporting cast is top-notch and is amazing to see all of them together in such a brilliant project.

Explosive in its content, thrilling in its presentations without losing the rhythm and the movement, "Frost/Nixon" comes as one of the most absorbing films ever made. It was everything I expected and more! Brilliant! 10/10

The sole reason I did not watch this in the cinema two years ago was that I could not find a theater near me that played it, and I was, as I am now, a busy student. That caused me to have to take breaks in my viewing of it, and I have to say, it was not easy to do so. It is, simply put, immensely gripping, and the ending is pitch perfect. I haven't seen the play, but I understand that this expands upon the people around the two who were engaged in the verbal boxing match, especially Cushing. The two leads are the same, and I can get behind getting them to do both versions. They are immensely talented(they had the material so committed to memory that they only flubbed once each), and Sheen is an absolute chameleon, disappearing entirely into what he portrays(I can just barely believe that he played Lucian in the Underworld trilogy... great job in those, by the way). The cast is fantastic, and everyone really delves into their credible and swiftly developed characters. This manages to not paint anyone as a one-note good or bad guy, and I have to admit, I did not feel any sympathy for the former president before this film. The acting is amazing. Dialog is excellent. A little of it was improvised; so was most of the camera-work, and it helps make it feel dynamic and natural. This builds tension rather well. The drama is compelling. There is a short sequence of disturbing content, infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track by Howard, a well-done 23 minute behind-the-scenes production, 22 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, and two well-made featurettes of 7 and a half minutes(about the real interview) and six minutes(about the Nixon library), respectively. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject. 8/10

Hollywood heavyweight Ron Howard adapts playwright Peter Morgan's West End hit for the silver screen with this feature focusing on the 1977 television interviews between British journalist David Frost and former president of the United States,Richard Nixon in the movie,Frost/Nixon. It is a historical drama film dramatizes the Frost/Nixon interviews of 1977.It stars Michael Sheen Frost and Frank Langella as former President Nixon.

At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office in '77. The Watergate scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds, and he had remained notoriously tight-lipped until he agreed to sit down with Frost. Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and- coming British broadcaster, and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview. When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth, fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected, or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared, what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain.At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency, it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office.

The film excels in recreating that landmark interview and the behind- the-scenes look at the power struggles between the two people.Also,it tells us how the former president was able to come up with memorable quotes such as "When the President does it,that means it's not illegal" through the British broadcaster's interviewing skills.Also,Ron Howard succeeds in providing interest to the viewer in a rather mundane,ordinary and not-so-interesting interview that makes the movie engaging,absorbing and worth watching. With respect to the performances of the actors,Langella excels in not mimicking the former president but rather in trying to bring the his natural personality and demeanor. In summary,Frost/Nixon succeeds in providing an unlikely tension and suspense in an unforgettable event.

This is, without a doubt, the best made film of the year. I will see this at least one more time before DVD. I know, with that comment, some people are going to say "No, it was The Dark Knight!" So take into account that I said that it was the best MADE film of the year. TDK's one flaw was Maggie Gylenhaal. But, hey! This isn't a Dark Knight review! This is Frost/Nixon.

Let's get going.

The Good: Flawless performances by everyone from the extras to the actors that are only in this movie for like two minutes. Despite the fact that it is all about an interview, it never gets boring because of how tense it becomes. I've heard people compare this interview to a boxing match. Hell yeah! This is so close to being a boxing match, that I half expected them to parody the ending scene of Rocky using Frost and Nixon. You like all of the characters for one reason or another- I actually felt sorry for Nixon at times. Like in a scene where he's giving a speech and you can see that the people aren't interested in what he's saying. Then comes this dialog between Nixon and Kevin Baken's character:

"I can't stand it, Jack! Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes! I feel like a circus animal doing tricks! AND I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR, I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON WATERGATE! DAMN IT! As soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate. It's as if all my other achievements cease to exist."

Some of dialog from the supporting characters is even funny at times, mostly coming from Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell. I felt Frost's frustration with trying to get money and sponsors as the sweat poured down his face. I was as frustrated as he was when nobody believed he would go anywhere. Jesus! In addition, the pacing is perfect. Being 2 hours long, and being about an interview, I expected this to drag like the When a Stranger Calls remake. I need to, last of all, give a lot of credit to Frank Langella. He may not look exactly like Nixon, but he's a damn good actor and I actually saw Nixon's face on his the entire time. Give him best actor.

Bad: Umm... jeez. Nothing.

Michael Sheen (aka the actor who you call upon to play every famous person who ever lived . . . . ever) plays David Frost and Frank Langella plays Richard Nixon in this movie adaptation of the successful stage play, that featured both of the actors playing the very same roles.

Ron Howard directs and does so with the same steady hand he has used on projects such as Apollo 13. The material is all there and he doesn't need to change much of it at all, just to point the cameras and capture the performances of two men acting out roles they are completely at ease with. The most impressive thing is how cinematic it all feels, there's a lack of staginess throughout despite the core of the movie simply revolving around one man interviewing another.

For those in the dark, the movie relates the tale of the defining, impactful interview between David Frost (a TV personality more used to the business of show than that of politics) and disgraced President Richard Nixon (a man who had shown no remorse or even admitted any wrongdoing for his part in the Watergate scandal) that had so much more riding on it than either man would have considered as they set the thing in motion.

For the cast Howard assembles a number of pitch-perfect performances. Sheen and Langella are, as can be expected, simply superb but the support from the likes of Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt, Matthew Macfadyen, Toby Jones and Rebecca Hall is just as good with everyone nailing their respective roles.

It may sound like dull subject matter but Howard sets things up very much like a prize boxing match and the last 20 minutes or so are amongst the most gripping I have watched in the past couple of years, with my partner and I sitting in stunned silence as we eagerly awaited the resolution of these two men jousting each other.

You already know the outcome, you already know who did and/or said what and you may have even already had your fill of Watergate and everything that came out about it but, trust me, you will still be entertained by some damn fine performances in a damn fine movie that's amongst Howard's best.

See this if you like: Nixon, All The President's Men, The Contender.

In an age of movies which are mostly eye candy this movie is a rare and special treat.

Based upon a successful stage play, this movie outlines a battle of wills, and a contest of minds in a way that attains high dramatic tension. Both the hero (Frost) and the anti-hero (Nixon) are made fully human, so the viewer becomes emotionally involved with both, each in different ways. Frost is the light-weight underdog, using words and strategy to trap the more experienced, cagey, but tragic character of Richard Nixon, a man who aspired to greatness, and actually did many great things, but was brought low by his own acts of conceit and arrogance. He is shown, despite his having attained the highest office in the US, as a tragic everyman, a person from the ordinary world of semi-poverty and a nondescript background who tried to enter the world of the elite, but never felt fully accepted.

But this movie is not just a wordy talk-a-thon. It is high drama of a cerebral kind. What will happen? Who will win? Will Tricky Dick slip out of the net cast by a light weight entertainer who is no reporter or interviewer? Will David Frost rise from low-level entertainer/moderator who interviews the Bee-Gees to become the man who got from Richard Nixon what no one else could get, an admission of culpability? Knowing history's final outcome does not detract from the drama of the events as they unfold.

If you love the art of cinema, then you will truly appreciate this film. It is a masterpiece, and a fine example of all that makes Hollywood great, and not just box office.

Throughout the history of the Presidency, there is but one man who was dishonorably forced to resign his job; Richard M. Nixon. Although no deal was suppose to have been made between Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, the first act President Ford carried out was to pardon his predecessor for a crime, he insisted he did not commit. In this film called " David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon " English Talk-show Host, David Frost, seizes a great opportunity to boost his ratings and secure several new TV shows, by arranging to interview the former Man in the White House. David Frost (Michael Sheen) plays Himself and is less convincing than his flaunted screen image. For this movie, Richard Nixon is played by exceptional actor Frank Langella, who does a remarkable job of playing the self-centered, egotistical and politically conniving ex-Congressman from California. The interview itself is fraught with planned attacks and defenses on both sides, each seeking to score points with the T.V. audiences watching across the country. Frost and Nixon hope their real motives for the Interview displays more style, than substance. Yet, after watching the entire movie, one believes there could have been more secured than ethereal coronets and self pity. The highlight of the film leans towards Langella when emotion, not confrontation becomes the final victory. This is one movie which should be seen by History and Political Science students in every school dealing with Watergate and Presidential authority. ****

Before seeing Frost/Nixon, I didn't think much of Ron Howard as a director (both A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 struck me as no more than mediocre commercial jobs). Despite my long admiration for Frank Langella's work on stage and for Kevin Bacon's work on screen, I expected no more than a moderately OK movie). Underwhelmed by most of the new 2008 movies (f'rinstance, except for Cate Blanchett, Benjamin Button disappointed in every aspect), the best 2 new 2008 movies I saw were Edge of Heaven and Stop-Loss (OK, I'm quirky, so what?). Until Frost/Nixon, that is. Its excellence in every area astonished me. Best movie of the year, best directing, best acting by the male lead, best adaptation. The supporting actors were admirable, especially Kevin Bacon, which came as no surprise (though if I were a voter, my vote for supporting actor would go to Robert Downey). I cannot praise Ron Howard enough for using his commercial skills as solid building blocks for a film partly about people selling entertainment and themselves in a mass medium. Nor can I give enough praise to Langella, whose decades of acting experience paid off in what may be his most challenging role--of a man whose decades of performing for his own audience was, in a way, his own most challenging role.

I thought that Ron Howard had lost his touch after Da Vinci Code's lack of chemistry between the actors. Frost/Nixon is a whole other story.

Frank Langella will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for his absolutely brilliant performance as Richard M. Nixon the Thirty Seventh President of the United States, and he would've won if it wasn't for Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Torino being his last. Langela becomes Nixon in the same way that Heath Ledger became the Joker. I think that Langella's accomplishment is even greater, because people knew what Nixon sounded like, people knew what Nixon was like, and Langella nails Nixon from the walk, the hunched over back, the accent, the speech pattern...everything.

Michael Sheen is excellent as David Frost, a British Talk Show host, who takes the huge leap, to interview the greatest Political Criminal in American History. Sheen does an incredible job of showing the stress that Frost was under when he underwent this strenuous interview. Sheen won't win an Academy award, but he matched Langella perfectly.

Kevin Bacon is very reliable again as the faithful Jack Brennan. Bacon does an excellent job of showing Brennan's loyalty to Nixon. The rest of the cast does a stellar job as well.

Ron Howard is a masterful director. He makes a very conventional movie, with very basic, but brilliant shots. He does a great job of flashing ahead, and showing the "Post Interview" interviews. The music is very well incorporated, due to Hans Zimmers incredible score. Zimmer will get nominated for most likely his second Oscar of 2008 for this incredible score.

The movie just captures the whole mood of Nixon's "Post Watergate Life" so well. It is almost like a biography of everything Nixon went through after he resigned the Presidency.

This movie is very...very good. You might just want to see it, because of Frank Langella's chilling performance as Richard Nixon, but it also is very interesting, and extremely detailed. 10/10

I'm old enough vaguely to remember the televised Frost/Nixon interviews. Even the presidency. And the U.S./Vietnam war. I shared the popular sense of moral outrage. But I'm not an American citizen, and I couldn't get worked up about, 'giving Nixon the trial he never had.' What difference did that make to me?

Something halfway through this movie changed my mind. Mid-interview, attempting to get a reaction from Nixon, Frost's team run footage of carnage in Cambodia caused by American carpet-bombing. I guess perhaps because I was in Cambodia only a few months ago. It made more of an impact. For all my intellectual appreciation of events, I hadn't been prepared for such devastation of a nation's psyche. An NGO worker looked into my eyes one day at a truck stop. She said, "And when I got here, I just cried every day for weeks." I think she knew, as our eyes met, that I, a grown man, had been crying in helplessness towards these people trying to hide my tears for days. Visiting the ancient temples and aid workers, but meeting villagers too, it was hard not to cry. I have never seen a people so psychologically annihilated. The first thing that had struck me was, here is a nation for whom the very idea of hope has been long ago discarded. I wanted Nixon to pay.

The horrific footage doesn't move Mr President, the way it moves me. I want him to have that trial. But Nixon is a heavyweight in every way, just as the actor portraying him. Frost, on the other hand, is almost a bit of a joke. Hardly a man to bet on. Yet from that moment I was rooting for him. The only person with a chance of bringing light into Nixon's disingenuous stonewalling. From that moment, I was emotionally hooked. I would happily overlook all but the most egregious of flaws.

Fortunately, like the real interview series, the film only gets better. As if it has been playing with us for an eternity before packing its punches.

I've never been much taken with Martin Sheen (Frost). I kept thinking of his performance as Tony Blair in The Queen and how, here as in The Queen, it seems too much like an impersonation. Rory Bremner on a good day. But it is almost Sheen's fallibility that allows the rest of the film to shine. Taking us off guard, just as Nixon was taken off guard. A cheap punk on the street who you walk past disparagingly, only to realise he's the mafia boss and you're surrounded. Then there's Kevin Bacon. Haven't I seen that suit in one too many movies? So when he hits me with real emotion towards the end (he's a very good actor) it has a profound shock. Both these men know how to play supporting actor in the true sense, supporting the lead role and the whole production Â rather than constantly making us notice their own lapels. But it's Frank Langella's towering interpretation of Nixon that eventually makes every other character real. Low-angle camera shots emphasise his power and he looms over us. The most powerful man in the world. And once we buy into that, everything we see in his 'world,' by definition, has to be 'real.'

Frost/Nixon is about as watertight as you get. Adapted by the man who wrote the play (and also wrote The Queen and Last King of Scotland); then an Oscar-winning director who only agrees to do it if he can have the two lead actors from his polished stage version. Remember how Ron Howard pulled it out of the bag with the equally dry-seeming, A Beautiful Mind? Well, he's done it again.

But for all the triumphant battle cries as Frost walks him into a trap, in the end it is Nixon that gets my sympathies. Even more than Frost gets my admiration. As I watch Nixon face his inner hell, I recall every speck of darkness in my own soul. How I never managed to make my father proud before he died. How I risked my career once when I stole a long international phone call in the office. How I cheated on the one woman I loved more than any woman in my whole life. Some sins just don't go away. Nixon becomes the Nemesis within Everyman.

Nixon, like a Judas Iscariot or Lady Macbeth, has no way of ever coming completely clean. But, through the ironic good fortune of an interviewer who outwits him, Nixon receives the gift of being able to say sorry. Sorry to the Americans he betrayed. His legacy, the symbol of ultimate duplicity Â the "-gate" tagged on to any word so to indicate scandal. See him fall Â is it then possible (for some perhaps) to open hearts and forgive?

The second biggest thing that is striking about Cambodians is their lack of ill-will. To the one who destroyed their country. Having never hated, they have no thing to forgive. A senior monk instructed me, while I was there, on a Buddhist method of mindfulness. One of the results of this mediation is that one focuses everything back on one's own action, and hence one's own moment-to-moment responsibility. It strikes me that for Nixon, Frost was like the senior monk. The guy who showed him how to face who and what he was. His catharsis. Not that anyone will ever say thank you (to Nixon, that is.)

And coming full circle, that's what cinema can do. It can take something that is intellectually discernible and make it real Â through an emotional investment. And it does it by means of fiction.
