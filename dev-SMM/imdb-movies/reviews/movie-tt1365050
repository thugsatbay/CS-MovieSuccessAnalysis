### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Child actors are a dime a dozen, yet Abraham Attah is something else. He transcends the category and remains such a demanding presence throughout the entire film, matching even Idris Elba's poise. His character's transformation is just one of the remarkable feats of storytelling that Beasts of No Nation graces us. A gripping account of modern day war seen through a child's eyes, Beasts of No Nation is easily one of the best of the year.

The first thing you'll notice is how beautiful the film is. The stark landscapes of West Africa draw you in, and the color palette for the film is quite something. Director and cinematographer Cary Fukunaga makes sure you remember the reality of this not-so-fictional story, paralleling Agu's family life and how his world was flipped upside down when he joined a group of mercenary fighters. Initially, Agu has no choice and uses them as an escape and a way to reunite with his mother, but the ruthless commandant (Elba) changes him.

The writing is fantastic as you see the war through Agu's eyes, and it's not pretty. This kind of situation is almost completely unfamiliar for most audiences, and Fukunaga manages to supplement fear for grace. He never lets us forget the harsh realities of war, touching on familiar themes like family but going a step further by making it personal for Agu. As the film is his story through and through, the adult details of war are kept to a minimum. The audience is just like Agu, unaware of exactly why there is fighting but rolling with it because it's his only choice. There's no strategic battle scenes, no planning on a map or signing peace treaties, as we are thrust into moments just like Agu is.

When the violence does break out, it's brutal and harrowing. Young actor Attah is ferocious yet sympathetic, and he brings these battle sequences down to earth. The creative risks that Fukunaga takes with these sequences might come across as pandering, yet they make sense cinematically and come across as action poetry. There's a certain lyricism to the war torn villages and jungles of the continent, and it's beautiful and unforgettable.

There isn't much dialogue in the film, but when there is it's brilliant. The unnamed commandant's ideology becomes clearer as the film goes on, and it reaches a disturbing peak. Fukunaga contrasts him with the initially innocent Agu and the two are at odds yet retain respect for one another. There are times when Agu could simply point a gun at the commandant and be done with it, but there's a humanity to the film that respects all lives. War isn't pretty, and Beasts of No Nation knows that. Yet this risky piece of entertainment remembers to be a film first and everything else second. The result is a rhythmic work of art with one of the best young performances I've seen.

I was sceptical of watching this film at first. It looked like a low budget, and amateur attempt for Netflix to get bigger in their original film business. I went to IMDb to see what people had to say, noticed it got decent reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me say, this is one of the best films I have ever seen within this genre.

Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is about the general civil warfare that exists in Africa, something most western, shelterd Americans have never even fathomed and have only learned about through movies. The film doesn't specify what part of Africa it is, but you know it is something that is real.

Netflix doesn't hide anything about the realities of what happens to families, children, fathers, and brothers, as well as the numbness the war leaders (on both sides, really) have toward excessive and brutal violence. Imagine: the film shows all of this through the eyes of a boy, probably only 12 years old. He is forced into a mercenary squad after his family is torn apart, and he experiences something that is even darker than hell itself.

That young boy, played by Abraham Attah, puts on a performance I have never seen before in a child actor. Given the mature content of the film, it is quite unbelievable that the torn emotions any child would have, given this situation, is so clearly displayed and authentic. Every scene just tore at my soul; I wondered if it was really acting. And he wasn't the only one; women, children, and the "extras" in the film: are these people really doing their first major film? Each scene left me speechless.

The emotional involvement I had with this film as a viewer is astonishing. I felt ashamed at myself for thinking my life had problems, for thinking my life was hard. I felt foolish realizing my immaturity in life, and felt embarrassed for us as America in general, for caring so much about things so materialistic and shallow, when people in Africa (and other parts of the world, no doubt), are fighting for their lives every day, being torn apart by corrupt leaders and greed.

To compare this film, it is similar to The City of God and Blood Diamond, but in an of itself, it is certainly unique. It's a masterpiece.

Originally known for his first two films Sin Nombre and Jane Eyre, Cary Fukunaga was put on the map for most by his audacious work on the first season of HBO's True Detective last year, unconventionally directing every episode. He got all-time worthy performances from Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey and boasted a palpable bleak mood from his photography, earning an Emmy for the episode "Who Goes There" with that captivating long take. He could do whatever he wanted after that, and so, tip toeing past comfortable studio gigs that may or may not have landed on his desk, he ventured out to the African jungles with Idris Elba for the most stressful shoot since Apocalypse Now. Catching malaria, filling in for an injured camera operator, and constantly rewriting the script due to the actors dropping out, the haphazard conditions shows on the film for better and for worse.

Coppola's film is an apt point of comparison for the effect of Beasts of No Nation, as well as Platoon and The Thin Red Line. Battered by explosions and gunfire, you come out of the film wearing the same thousand yard stare as its characters. At that point, it's easy to forget the delights of the first ten minutes as Abraham Attah's Agu playfully hustles his living, selling shells of television sets with his friends. It's not a perfect life, but the energy is reminiscent of the less dangerous sections of City of God. It's only from that light that the darkness hits hardest and invests you in Agu's plight and losses. However, this is as rocky as the roller-coaster gets. The next 2 hours is an absorbing barrage of misery and brutal dilemmas. The narrative thread is very loose, and perhaps some is lost in translation with the character's thick accents, but this is part of its point, especially in utilising child soldiers who won't know the ins and outs of what's going on anyway.

This aimlessness of the mission and the way that the war is so much bigger than the soldiers and battalions demonstrates that there is no way into peace from war. The kids are fighting for a future that they won't be able to find solace in, neither from eventual living and economical conditions, nor inner peace from the atrocities they've committed. These bleak ideas hit hard. And like Malick's The Thin Red Line, a relationship with God in war is challenged. It's questioned whether it's possible or fair to have spiritual happiness after such sins. There is very poor foresight in war, and after only briefly touching a jarring scene where they visit the higher ups, it benefits no-one on the battleground. The film never preaches these messages, instead relying on the fact that we know how heartbreakingly true it is despite how far removed most of us will be.

Abraham Attah absolutely disappears into his role. He's not showy, but just completely immersed in the film whether he's soaking in events or lashing out against them. He's easily the biggest discovery here. However, I expected great things from Elba after the hype and while he is good, it wasn't the tour de force performance I anticipated. That's just not how the character ended up being written. He has memorable moments but he teeters undefinably on the line between a manipulative villain and a manipulative mentor. He's no doubt an opportunist, but the film doesn't explore his character to the full extent, and the most dramatic moments are quite familiar as they're staples in other war films. Beasts stands out by having such a young boy other end of those dilemmas. Elba is perhaps too polished to go with the inherent rawness of the rest of the cast.

Fukunaga's cinematography is quite good, not boasting the same tricks as True Detective, but also clearly battling against the elements. It certainly has atmosphere. The style favours ambient music over montages of the war scenes and while that makes it flow together it also means that its surprises fall by the periphery. I can imagine that this will play well on Netflix, granted you give it full attention on a big HD television. The cinema projection does suffer from added graininess but that is rarely a problem via the internet and should compliment Fukunaga's cinematography a little more. I imagine that it will garner a divided reaction, with some finding it too hard to bare through the whole thing, but I can't imagine it getting much Oscar traction based on passion alone. It will be a pleasant and worthy surprise if it does score any nominations. At least an admirable effort that will be being remembered as one of the most notable war films of this decade.

This is quite simply one of the best war films of the 21st Century. Netflix's first outing on the big screen is a huge success thanks to an absolutely harrowing tale of conflict that makes for one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking movie experiences you've had in a long time.

The story follows this young boy, Agu, as he becomes deeper and deeper involved in the rebel army under the wing of the Commandant, played by Idris Elba. Both of these performances are simply excellent. Elba is often terrifying as the warmongering troop leader, and his unnerving performance is key to making this such an unsettling and disturbing film.

However, even Idris Elba is outshone by the stunning performance given by the young Abraham Attah, who plays Agu. Attah does a brilliant job at showing his character's transformation over the course of the story, from an innocent young boy to a hardened warrior in one of the most brutal wars on the planet.

This ties in perfectly, then, with the main theme of the film, which is all about the way that war destroys innocence entirely and replaces it with only doom and despair. In that, you can see that this is clearly an anti-war film, but it fortunately doesn't present itself so much as that, only giving you its powerful message if you concentrate hard enough and look for the details telling you about the destruction that war has brought to this place.

I say that because this film is, on the whole, not the most fast- paced, and if you watch it with your brain turned off, you'll likely be bored, because it's quite long, and hasn't got much action at all, it's the power and emotion of the underlying themes that provides the horrifying punch that makes this so compelling and upsetting.

Cary Joji Fukunaga's directing is also stunning. As well as making a simply beautiful film to look at, the way he directs every scene works brilliantly in tandem with whatever the film is trying to say. There are so many astonishing long shots of individuals' faces, particularly focused on Agu, and they just have such an incredible emotional power when you really look deep into their situation.

Abraham Attah's performance as a young boy who has clearly been through hell is of course integral to making that emotion clear, but the inventive and beautiful directing really aggrandises that feeling of total despair and loss of innocence, which is why this film is just such an incredible one to watch.

It's not often that a film induces a genuine change of heart in me, but this one did. I used to simply hate and despise the raggedy rebel armies of West Africa with their child soldiers, their cruel atrocities and apparent primitive mindless violence towards civilians in general. But this film showed me a side to them that I had never considered. I found myself feeling sorry for them, and the cynical way in which they were used. I realized that they must also have courage, and discipline, and belief in the cause. Like any fighters, they must advance into deadly danger. The lead actor is a child, yet more than holds his own with Idris Elba, a great actor by any measure. By the end I was shaken. I will not forget this film. And I will never think the same way again about the tragic and pointless wars of Africa.

Compelling with beautiful shots and music. Watched on Netflix where other options and distractions are a abundant, but I did not put this down. It is quite the untold story about such a huge political and inhumane problem within Africa today. Casting was great, very memorable faces. I would say this is what American Sniper should have been like. The changes in characters was gradual and smooth, PTSD and other issues were presented much better. Eye opening in a way old stories used to be. This was much more than entertainment, but more of a virtual experience like Saving Private Ryan was. Quite gritty as well, which doesn't bother me, but for those that are sensitive this will be a hard watch.

Greetings again from the darkness. Cary Joji Fukunaga has quickly established himself as an expert storyteller with his previous writing and directing of SIN NOMBRE (2009), JANE EYRE (2011) and the fascinating and conversation-sparking first season of "True Detective" (he did not direct the much-maligned Season Two). He goes even deeper and darker this time by adapting Uzodinma Iweala's novel about a child soldier.

When first we meet Agu, he is but an enterprising and fun-loving kid who thrives on mischief such as trying to sell "Imagination TV"  the empty shell of a console TV, complete with Agu and his buddies acting out scenes for those who peer through the picture tube opening. Agu describes himself as "a good boy from a good family", and we believe him.

Somewhere in Africa is all we know about the location, and soon enough Agu's village is under siege and he is separated from his mother, and forced to stay behind with the men  including his father and big brother. More terror forces Agu alone into the forest until he is brought into a mostly young group of rebel forces led by the Commandant (Idris Elba). It's around this time that Agu begins "talking" to God through voice over narration that allows viewers to understand what's going on inside Agu's head  often quite contrary to what is happening on the outside as he transforms from mischievous kid to dead-eyed child soldier. When Agu stops speaking to God, we understand that he believes he no longer deserves to be heard, but his words to the universe (directed to his mother) let us know, this boy has not yet lost his soul.

Though we never understand the war, or even who is fighting whom, this uncertainty is designed to help us better relate to Agu. He may be a tough-minded soldier, but we also never forget that he is mostly a little boy hoping to re-connect with his mother. Idris Elba plays the Commandant as part father-figure, part war lord, and part cult leader. He is a menacing presence one moment and a soothing voice of reason the next. When we (and Agu) learn the full story of his multiple sides, we are both sickened and disheartened. It's the performances of both Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah (as Agu) that make this such a devastating and fascinating movie to watch, and it's the filmmaking of Fukunaga that keeps our eyes glued to the screen when we would just as soon turn away.

This is one of the best films of the year! Cary Fukunaga swings and hits the ball out of the park and the ball hit a windshield! A film with so much savagery that it also makes you feel for this boy and what he is going through! A must see and one of the many reasons to go and get a Netflix account! Idris Elba gives the best performance of his life as the Commandment! Abraham Attah is amazing and has one of the best child actor performances ever! It is as good as True Detective and one of Netflix's best pieces of entertainment! Hopefully those Adam Sandler movies don't ruin their perfect line up(which it probably will).

From the beginning I had high hopes for this movie and it lived up to my expectations. From beginning to end The Child goes through his stages as he is more exposed to violence. He was at first a very innocent kid scared to be apart of the fight but when circumstances force him to join the violence he has only one choice. The children acting in this movie are amazing, it is one of the best movies where a child grabs your attention. The director did a great job on here. And can't Forget Idris Elba, not an outstanding performance but still great. Idris's character also goes through his stages on this one too just like the kid. The Scenery was beautiful and it wasn't really nothing special but it's hard for me these days to come across a movie that I can rate over a 7 and this one is a 8 in my book. With this one Netflix proves that their originals are one of the best nowadays.

The problem with Beasts Of No Nation is a problem familiar with all depictions of Africa - the absence of any kind of context.

Things happen for no reason, allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with previous propaganda, making the viewer believe that their previous misconceptions have now been confirmed.

Beasts Of No Nation was made by Cary Joji Fukunaga, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow. The Rockefellers own among the world's largest extractive industry corporations owners/founders - ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, United Fruit/Chiquita, and many more. A similar family started Royal Dutch Shell, which exploits the people of Nigeria for their oil.

Which brings me to the decontextualization - this story is set 'in a fictional African country', however the writer of the book is a Nigerian national. If the Idris Alba character would have been working for someone, it would have been Shell, maybe Anglo-Ashanti Gold, or his direct superiors would have been working on their behalf.

This is lost in the war porn, as it always is. Because Beasts Of No Nation is just one in a long line of 'mood setting' rather than informative movies about Africa, all of which are funded by the same extractive industry corporations and the families that own them.

Blood Diamonds was made on behalf of the Kimberley Process, which tried to restrict diamond exports from Zimbabwe and the Congo DRC. It was driven by Nicky Oppenheimer of Anglo-American De Beers, the world's diamond monopolist in the 20th century, and even today the world's biggest diamond miner with 40% of global diamonds mined and traded.

The Interpreter, with Nicole Kidman, another movie 'set in a fictional African country', however clearly based on Zimbabwe, where De Beers covets the huge Chiadzwa and Marange diamond fields, which could supply 20% of the world's diamond supply and crash the world's diamond price. Mugabe And The White African is in a similar vein, trying to demonize the government of Zimbabwe, while extolling the virtues of Rhodesia.

Then of course there was the propaganda of Eve Ensler, trying to hyper-focus the destruction of Eastern DRC by the Rwandan government's M-23, into 'the Vagina Monologues'. Again, leaving the actual culprits out of the picture, and focusing on mercenaries/soldiers and war porn instead.

De Beers lost 117,000 hectares of land in the land redistribution of 2000, and they want it back. And if that means portraying Africans as psychotic 'Beasts Of No Nation', well that's what they've been doing for over 100 years.

The problem about a film on a child soldier in Africa is that child actors are hard to direct and are usually not good actors. That cannot be said for Abraham Attah who embodies his character and makes us feel all his pain as the movie progresses. The first part of the movie where everything is good is all the more heartbreaking when everyone gets shot down. We slowly see how a child's mentality can be twisted and controlled by a charismatic but ultimately shallow Idris Elba who as always kills it in his role. The action sequences remind me who directed the movie as the controlled chaos is very Fukunaga and he excels at those scenes. They all have emotional motive and impact and are very realistic. The problem that the movie has are too many minor plots and minor characters take too much screen time. The commander's second and command and Agu's foil/ friend are well utilized but extend the movies long screen time. The ending was a bit of a letdown as Agu and the army leaves the commander in the jungle without any real payoff.

I guess it's time to start talking about awards season with this new amazing film Beasts of No Nation directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga starring Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah, the powerful child lead. 

Though I am glad Netflix is entering the arena of producing major motion pictures, I wish there was a theater near me that was brave enough to show this film because this movie deserves viewing on a large screen. As it was on Netflix, I often paused it and did other things before coming back to it because life is busy, not because this film ever lost my interest. The Revenant is going to have to be one amazing film to compete with this masterpiece.

This story needs to be told and I applaud Netflix for taking this brave step, not only in cinema distribution but in the topic at hand. Abraham Attah plays the young boy Agu and almost immediately reveals himself to be a talented, charismatic young actor. I am curious to see the behind-the-scenes to see how he handled such complicated shots and intense sets. I've heard some amazing stories about the filming but that the film fell heavily on this young man's shoulders and he pulled it off so well is really a credit to everyone involved and should signal a bright future for Mr. Attah as actor if that is his pursuit. His voice-over pleas to God throughout are chilling.

Idris Elba delivered another powerful performance, something we've all come to expect and possibly take for granted. At this point, it's his supporting actor award to lose and I'm not sure what other performance has generated as near enough buzz to compete. Surely not Seth Rogen but I should catch Steve Jobs later this week so we'll see. As the Commandanat, Mr. Elba has the opportunity for powerful speeches and intensely personal scenes and he plays them all like a true professional. I am rooting for him to go all the way with this one.

As for the plot, this movie is so harsh and unrelenting and Fukunaga's camera style captures every detail with his signature tracking shots and tragically powerful images that give you no place to hide from the violence that plays out on screen. This was a great follow up choice to True Detective for this director. 

I don't know what the reception will be for this film over time as it has taken such an unorthodox way to be distributed but I do believe this is the future of cinema and theaters will have to adjust. It is really telling that such a powerful film serves as the pioneer for the popular streaming service. I hope it does receive the recognition and accolades it deserves.

Based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Uzodinma Iweala, 'Beasts of No Nation' is well-acted, but unevenly written! The sad part is that this tale, as brutal as it is, it still isn't as powerful as it proclaims to be.

'Beasts of No Nation' is A drama based on the experiences of Agu, a child soldier fighting in the civil war of an unnamed African country.

'Beasts of No Nation' is well-made, but not very well-written. And thats its minus point. Cary Joji Fukunaga's Adapted Screenplay doesn't engage entirely. I was definitely aghast at times, but the monotony put me off. Once Agu is taken under the wings of the villain, the sequences tend to repeat & what follows also, doesn't turn out to be gut-wrenching. Fukunaga's Writing needed to be more harrowing. His Direction, however, is realistic to the core. 

Performance-Wise: Idris Elba as Commandant, is terrifying. This is a performance that Elba can boast for a long, long time. He creates a human in the monster he portrays & that's a really big achievement. Abraham Attah as Agu, is tremendous. The child slips into this difficult, disturbing part & portrays it without a single false note.

On the whole, 'Beasts of No Nation' needed to be more powerful. Watch it for the superb acting nonetheless.

Since its release consecutively in cinemas and on Netflix - who hold the distribution rights - Cary Joji Fukunaga's Beasts of No Nation has been caught up in controversy. Feeling the traditional 90-day exclusivity to cinemas was being breached with Netflix subscribers also able to stream online, many cinema chains boycotted the film and reduced its circulation to selected independent theatres. This non-traditional form of release could also be blamed for its omission from the Academy Awards, with Idris Elba's Best Actor snub the most glaring eyebrow-raiser in the #OscarSoWhite debate.

Of the film itself, Beasts of No Nation is an intermittently excellent portrayal of child soldiers in an unnamed African country that works best when focusing on innocence lost and the relationship between narrator Agu (Abraham Attah) and his Commandant (Elba), yet hampered by pacing issues and an exhausting running time. Fukunaga has proved himself to be a skilled director already with Sin Nombre (2009) and the first season of HBO's True Detective, with the latter's awkward second season certainly feeling his absence, but while Beasts can be commended for ambition, he is perhaps not ready to join the big boys just yet.

One of the movies biggest strong points is the cinematography, done by Fukunaga himself. With a bleached colour palette that evokes old war photography, Fukunaga finds a way to keep the film grounded in reality while delivering delirious set-pieces. In one particularly memorable sequence, Agu and his comrades, all hallucinating from drugs, raid a village as the visuals turn a trippy purple, heightening the insanity and horror of the senseless brutality on show. Elba really is terrific too, careful to keep his monstrous character toned-down and believable. He is fair and unforgiving, tender and brutal, and his boys worship him. Attah as Agu is equally impressive, and the moments in which the Commandant's veil begins to break is when the film is at its most dramatically powerful.

The main question I had with the movie is why make this movie now? For the most part, Beasts is a series of war atrocities in which only Agu, the Commandant and Agu's mute friend Strika (Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye) are distinguishable in the crowd, so if the point is that various countries within Africa are routinely devastated by revolutions and government overhauls driven by personal greed or ambition, then I would point you in the direction of Johnny Mad Dog (2008), Jean Stephane Sauvaire's powerful piece tackling the exact same themes. The funny beginning and the gut-churning middle is where the film is most effective, but Beasts drags in its final third, struggling to round up Agu's story in a digestible running- time.

What to take away from this film - Cary Fukunaga wants to play with the big boys, but he shouldn't just yet. There are a number of questionable directorial choices made in Fukunaga's film, but the biggest problem is that the good choices aren't nearly as effective as they should be. Child soldiers, rape, murder, grenades stuck in people's mouths - this should have turned my stomach but I watched the whole thing with indifference and the main thing I've taken away is its excruciating run time and poor pacing.

Beasts of No Nation's first act is very promising - a group of kids are playing with old junk. Its necessary in films like this to establish innocence before we can establish that it has been lost. It goes on a bit too long but we meet our main character Agu, played by the exceptional Abraham Atta, a young actor who excels whenever Fukunaga gives him the opportunity. When his village is sacked by government forces during a civil war, Agu flees and falls in with a battalion of soldiers (including children) led by the fierce Commandant. Idris Elba has been gathering Oscar buzz for this role - he is certainly a good actor, but the Commandant fails to leap out of the screen and be a manipulative father figure like Steve Carell in Foxcatcher or a commanding leader like Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland. Besides Atta, the other highlight comes in the form of Jenny Eagan's costumes - everything ranging from the Commandant's distinctive blue to the warrior who wears nothing but a jockstrap to Agu's evolving outfit are noticeable and do a great deal to telling apart all these interchangeable characters. 

Throughout the film, we watch Agu smile as an innocent, and then smile in spite of war, and then smile because of war. It corrupts him and soon he begins to do unthinkable things and almost relish in it. The story has a great deal of potential, but Fukunaga's questionable choices undermine it in places. Battle sequences are shown from multiple angles but from only one side's perspective, making them almost impossible to follow. Bizarre scenes of Elba and his men dancing before a battle and children singing played in the background while the atrocities are committed are tonally inconsistent and make the film messy.Characters are either paper thin or never fully explored - some implications that the Commandant is a pedophile or the mystery of why young Strika doesn't speak are never explained or revisited, instead giving cinematographer Fukunaga more time to frame shots of grass and trees. I could have easily shaved half an hour off this film in the form of unnecessary conversations and framing shots. We get it Cary, we're in Africa. Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan make you feel filthy just watching the characters roll around in the dirt. The dirt and stink doesn't radiate here like in that movie, just highlighting again the Fukunaga isn't ready to join the big boys like Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg.

More than one "artistic" scene ends up making the whole movie confusing - if Agu hallucinated his mother here, did he hallucinate his brother's girlfriend later? There are some very nice scenes - including a silent empathy extended from Strika to Agu after Commandant molests the latter - but for the most part the film is completely hollow. The film's third act - during which Commandant goes rogue from his leaders and takes his men into the wilderness - is one act too many and wastes its potential. Even its climax, where Agu and the others turn on Commandant and leave him alone and sad, feels completely lacking in feeling and there is no feeling of relief as Agu finally breaks away.

I have seen several documentaries about the insane fighting throughout Africa, such as in the Congo. Rebel forces often consist of little more than private armies of mere children brainwashed into committing the worst atrocities. And, they long ago lost track of their goals of freedom or power--and are simply bend on destruction and death. The Netflix film "Beasts of No Nation" is a dramatization of such an army but the exact countries involved are never mentioned...and it could be one of several across the continent.

The film centers on a boy who appears to be about 8-10 years old, Agu. When the film begins, he's living in a zone controlled by the UN, though true to form the UN troops soon leave and the village is destroyed by government forces. Agu runs into the bush and eventually comes into contact with the rebel group, the NDF. This group is run by the Commandant (Idris Elba)--an awful combination of father, prophet, guru, rapist and the Devil. The process by which Agu is brainwashed and turned into a killing machine makes up the most of this film.

So is this any good? Yes and no. The film is very well made and compelling. But, it is also hellish and awful--so awful I cannot imagine anyone WANTING to see it. Viewing the film is more an endurance contest than anything else. In other words, can the viewer even watch it to the end since it's thoroughly unpleasant...so unpleasant that it makes "Hotel Rwanda" seem like a Disney film by comparison!! Pedophilia, rape, brutal murders and death...this is "Beasts of No Nation" in a nutshell. Documentaries on the same subject are easier to watch and just as informative.

War is a tough time for any nation, and especially any child. War can be an even more brutal affair if this child is left to fight in it. Beasts of No Nation tries to depict this and does so quite well. From its disturbing visuals to its increasingly touching dialogue, Beasts of No Nation depicts an African Civil war near perfectly; except for a few crucial aspects. Beasts of No Nation poorly displays its characters and gives them an unrealistic mindset. I will touch on this and many of the things that director Cary Joji Fukunaga does magnificently in this review. (note: this movie isn't a casual Saturday night film to watch drunk in your fraternity house eating cold cuts off of your stomach, it is quite deep and VERY disturbing.)

This film follows a young African boy named Agu (Abraham Attah). His village gets attacked, and he finds himself in the middle of a full out civil war. He joins the anti-government rebels (which don't fly X-wings) and becomes a child soldier in a battalion led by the malicious yet caring character of "Commandant" (Idris Alba). 

While Attah's acting was above adequate, certainly for a child, I found that in certain scenes he lacked the drama and raw emotion that a young child would have during a war. He does, however, deliver very touching narration. In some films, narration is the director's cheap way of telling a story. In this one, it really added some much needed emotion to Agu. Alba, while not being as likable or witty a character as in The Wire, still delivers as Commandant in this film. Towards the start of the film he is portrayed as a legend, immune to danger or fear. However, as this film progresses, Commandant's flaws begin to show, and Alba captures this perfectly (and rocks that African accent).

The action sequences are fine. They really brought nothing new to the table, but instead of seeing Bruce Willis taking down bandits left and right, we are shown fearful children with guns fighting for what they believe in, which was refreshing. Additionally, not every action scene was intended to gather pity, which I liked. If you are going to include an action scene in something described as a "war movie", it better be adrenaline filled. Beasts of No Nation delivers on this front.

This brings me to my favourite aspect of this film: the "in between" scenes. In between the large and tough battles that Agu's battalion goes through, Fukunaga does us the favour of showing us how these "soldiers" live life. Here we are exposed to what hints at slight character development (something this movie really lacks), the disturbing atrocities committed by both Commandant and the rest of the battalion, and the brilliant narration given by Agu.

With all of this in mind, it will be shocking to know that my biggest complaint with this film is it is hard to care about many of the characters. I don't mean to sound like a heartless Sith Lord, but I really couldn't get invested enough in Agu's character to truly sympathize with him. I did indeed wonder why I had this mindset, and even worried at one point. Then I came to a conclusion. Fukunaga's focus on creating disturbing scenes and decent action sequences led him to neglect character and context of the story. 

I feel that had act one been slightly longer, we could have gotten to know Agu and his family a lot more. As a result we care for them a lot more. Had Agu's thought process been slightly more childish and innocent towards the start of the war, it would better highlight his loss of innocence as the war unfolded. I also feel that had we been given more historical background and information on the war being fought, we would better understand the situation of this African country (which I don't even remember having a name the movie!).

So do I recommend you watch this? Sure, if you are willing to excuse unrealistic character and accept it as more of a war story and less of a drama. (which I don't mind!) Hey, maybe I am a Sith Lord and have no heart, so if you enjoy the drama in this movie, I am jealous of you!

Grade: B+ (7.3/10)

Well, not exactly... I did like it overall, if maybe liked it a lot. But there was some disconnect between a lot of what I was feeling. Visually and directorially, I think it's a great achievement. Fukanaga really knows how to carry a scene, and he doesn't milk anything for sentimentality. Technically, the film is a marvel. But something about it was also making me doubt how much I was liking it. I was getting lost in its world and something kept nagging at me, and it wasn't until it was over that I sort of realized. Elba is great no doubt, but by making his character be the central conflict in the film, I feel like the film forgets what the real horror here should be, which is the war. It definitely comes down to the screenplay. There's nothing inherently bad about it, it's definitely not a bad screenplay by any means. But it also works around what its themes should be too easily. There's such a clear structure and formula at play here, and some of it (like I said previously, mostly revolving around Elba's character and the conflict there) just seems to rise from obvious tweaks and manipulations in the script. Yes, all filmmaking is a manipulation, but the key is to not make the audience notice. The second half of this especially felt like it was playing it too conveniently. I don't know how to exactly word what I am feeling, but all I know is that, thematically, what it did concentrate on should've been able to hit harder because of a connecting link to the atrocities of war and humankind. instead, that's not how the film comes across by the end. Something. just. didn't. click. Not to any totally debilitating manner, I still like the film. But something here wasn't handled as well as it should've.

Yes, Elba is totally supporting and that should be his Oscar campaign. He makes the role work wonders, hiding some of the script's weaknesses. Abraham Atta is amazing though.

Never overdoes any of it and the film is all the better for it. I definitely need to rest up more on my thoughts on this film to see if I have less (or more) of a problem than the one I mentioned here.

I kept putting this film off when I would see it listed on Netflix. I am not sure why, because it was very enjoyable. I won't claim to have very much knowledge in the area of African civil war, but the movie seemed to convey the story in a way that was understandable for me. The relationship between all the characters was full of an unsettling comradery, which for me definitely made the movie. It was well filmed, well directed, and well acted overall. The only negatives, and they aren't even that negative, are that in some parts I had an issue understanding the accent and had to rewind, not that often mind you. The second was I felt it could have been just a little more dark in regards to the culture of the rebels, I have seen some documentaries on the subject, and those people are/were ruthless. They did touch on some of the things, drug use, cannibalism, etc. So it was gritty, but I prefer super gritty, maybe just me though. Therefore it gets a 7/10 check it out.

A very painful movie to sit through. Not because that it is bad, not at all. It was a very magnificent film. However some of the scenes and the things that the main protagonist, a child: Agu was put through and experiences is at times hard to watch. However unreal these things are it is hard to believe that in fact the film only reflects reality, the stone cold truth of some of these more rural regions in the world where political corruption, warlords, guerrilla warfare and child soldiers are a reality. 

This is a visually stunning film, completed with powerful lines delivered brilliantly by the cast. Abraham Attah who played Agu was a definite highlight in the film. Along with Idris Elba who gave a wonderfully disturbing performance. I think that it is very interesting that this whole event is set in an unnamed country and Idris Elba's character was simply named, 'commander'. In fact other than Agu I don't think there are any characters with a 'real name' they are either unnamed or has some sort of an alias. This to me has very special implications, it is a very interesting choice made I believe to represent that these people are simply, 'the spoils of war' those who are never going to be known or seen by the world. Which makes all of them and their experiences all the more meaningful.

Oddly I would say that this film is a coming of age story. But instead of slowly gradually understanding how the world works through meaningful and enriching experiences, we have this character who is basically forced to grow up, he is thrown into a world of drugs, violence and death. At the end of the day he realizes that he can no longer return to his childhood he has lost that childish innocence. 

"I saw terrible things... and I did terrible things. So if I'm talking to you, it will make me sad and it will make you too sad. In this life... I just want to be happy in this life. If I'm telling this to you... you will think that... I am some sort of beast... or devil. I am all of these things... but I also having mother... father... brother and sister once. They loved me." This is a modern war film that reflects 'war' in this modern day and depicts the very true aspects that are ironically not seen or known by many. In many ways the character of Agu and the many child soldiers in these more rural areas are much more experienced.

***Possible spoilers ahead*** What's good: The acting- Something I've heard time and time again is that a good actor will make you forget their name and see who they are. This certainly the case with Elba and Attah. Nothing seemed over-the-top in their performances. Both portrayed the right amount of darkness along with the appropriate amount of humanity. Storytelling: This film managed to keep my attention with a great plot, dynamic characters, and masterful pacing. What could be better: The irrevocable effect on this movie is that it breaks hearts. The end of Attah's story arc is shown. I'm happy for him, but I know he still has a long road ahead. I don't think there should be a sequel showing his recovery, but the ending of the film seemed abrupt. Maybe that was by the design of Fukunaga.

This movie with 2 hours and 17 min have a really long story, but thats OK because war is long, war is insupportable, war is brutal. And this movie makes you feel it. Sometimes is hard to watch because of the brutal scenes.

The camera is really great, i also liked the color grading of the movie. 

Actors and Story was also very good. Idris Elba as the commandant was really great. His Voice provide the movie a manic atmosphere.

Don't watch that movie if you are tired! This movie need attention while you watching it.

I was in two minds about watching this movie - I wasn't sure that the subject matter and location really appealed to me. Boy was I wrong!!! This is a very powerful drama which is totally realistic. Superb acting - especially by the lead young boy Agu. The movie contains some very harrowing scenes - it's not an easy watch, but it is worthwhile.

The movie is well directed and gives you plenty of food for thought. It will undoubtedly change your views and opinions on what actually happens in these civil wars in relatively unknown countries and regions of Africa. I'm seeing and understanding things differently now - mostly because of this movie.

If you are in two minds about watching this, there are some very eloquent reviews in praise of this movie. I was one of those people. I'm glad I chose to watch it. Very worthwhile.

The fact that Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah, and Idris Elba weren't even *nominated* for Oscars is criminal. This was a moving story that shines a light on the sort of things going on with child soldiers in Africa. While set in an unnamed fictional African country with fictional characters, it clearly draws inspiration from the fighting in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In fact, at one point, Commandant call a soldier "SBU," possibly a reference to the "Small Boys Unit," a child soldier unit of the Revolutionary United Front militants who fought in Sierra Leone. Commandant also has similarities to Joseph Kony of the Lord's Resistance Army.

While Idris Elba is the big name and was extremely convincing as Commandant, it's Abraham Attah as Agu who stole the show. Attah's strong and nuanced performance, particularly in light of the emotionally difficult material, was mesmerizing. Hopefully we'll see a lot more of him in the future.

To the Academy, shame on you for overlooking this movie and its performers, particularly Attah and Elba!
