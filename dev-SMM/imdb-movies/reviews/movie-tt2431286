### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). Both British films have strongly emotional undercurrents leavened by wry humour, feature outstanding performances from the leads and are based on true stories.

Judi Dench, as the Irish woman whose out-of-wedlock son is taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold to a rich American couple in the 1950's, has never been better. She imbues the role with a mix of wisdom (after all, as she reminds us repeatedly, she was nurse for 30 years) and naivet√© that would seem to be impossible were it not so deftly handled. While the cynical atheist portrayed by Steve Coogan rarely misses an opportunity to poke fun at her, more often than not she enjoys the last laugh.

Despite the consummate acting, and Frears' slick directing, the greatest treat of the film is Steve Coogan's screenplay. Given its subject matter, the story could easily have veered into melodrama, but just when it is on the verge of doing so Coogan pulls us back from the edge. Thankfully, Coogan himself is there to convey precisely the proper blend of sarcasm and compassion.

Having lived the mother-baby home experience in Ireland (born at another of the Sacred Heart homes, Bessboro, in Cork in 1960, and trafficked to the US in 1961) and working as an advocate for the rights of adopted people and survivors of Irish Magdalene Laundries for more than twenty years, I'm always prepared to be either underwhelmed or angry at the film industry's ineptitude with subjects like this, I have to say I have not been as pleasantly surprised since Mike Leigh's excellent 'Secrets and Lies' and Peter Mullan's superb 'The Magdalene Sisters'. Frears, Coogan, Dench et al give Philomena's very true story such punch, truth and pathos, a heady accomplishment given the subject matter.

I look forward to the film's US release and urge my fellow 'Banished Babies' to see it, although I recommend going with support as it's very triggering. Let's hope Philomena's strength and tenacity, so powerfully portrayed by Dame Judy, coax more mothers living in shame and denial to reach out to their lost children before it's too late.

My wife talked me into going, I wanted to see Captain Philips but she was adamant this time. We both grew up in Ireland and I didn't want to see another one of those movies focused on stereotypes, the marketing blob types like the Quiet Man and Ryan's Daughter...stereotypical nonsense that lampoon our history and our culture. Steve Coogan and Judy Dench, especially Judy got it just right from the very start. They were smart, witty, serious and most of all, Judy was 'Irish' They really got the spirit of an Irish mom, that cocktail of guilt, generosity, inferiority and a heart to care for the entire world spot on. Dench in the hotel thanking everybody for being 'so nice' and getting who her son was as a child as others were today trying to 'break the news' to her...she wasn't just a step ahead, she was years ahead. Really excellent, really well done. Beautiful!

Steve Coogan deserves utmost respect for producing and writing this film. His script is excellent, consistently witty and engaging on the surface whilst spinning many more layers beneath the surface which became unconsciously stirring. Normally with these kinds of films I find the humour becomes contrived, forced or inappropriate, like the writers/director buckle under a need to impress and please the audience. You won't find those jarring moments here - Philomena is expertly judged and balanced. The story itself is fascinating, and again Coogan's script steers clear from overt sentimentality to allow the humanity to speak for itself. A gentle, funny, heartbreaking and unforgettable film. I actually much prefer it to the Kings Speech.

Sometimes I get the feeling filmmakers have lost their way. Formulas work and make the basics irrelevant so we get carbon copy blockbusters appealing to the masses clearly showing a reckless disregard for what filmmaking is all about: visually telling a story. And then a film like Philomena comes along and reminds us of the magic that can happen when a true craftsman and artist skillfully blends the basic ingredients of story, character, camera, and music into an exhilarating and powerful work of art. This film is satisfying at every level and gives me hope that some people still know what they are doing when they take the money and do their job effectively. The folks on this one should be extremely proud of their efforts.

The most remarkable thing about Stephen Frears' remarkable film "Philomena" is just how unsentimental and just how funny it actually is. Human Interest stories, the phrase Martin Sixsmith, (played superbly here by Steve Coogan), uses to describe exactly what it is he is doing in taking on the case of Philomena Lee, usually leave me cold for the very reasons Sixsmith describes in the film. But this is no ordinary 'human interest' story but a study of goodness triumphing over evil in a very real sense for surely Philomena Lee, as portrayed here, is a truly good person and the system she found herself fighting, though hardly by choice, namely the Catholic Church in Ireland, is in this instance anyway, evil. It's a heart-wrenching story but told with a good deal of natural humour and a distinct lack of lachrymation, (though you would need to have a heart of stone or no heart at all not to be moved to tears). The director is Stephen Frears who almost takes a back seat and lets the tale tell itself. The script is by Coogan and Jeff Pope and it beautifully encapsulates the book that Sixsmith wrote about Philomena Lee's search for the son who was taken away from her by Irish nuns and sold to an American couple simply because she had given birth out of wedlock at a time when such 'sins' were considered almost unforgivable. But Philomena never displays bitterness nor does she feel hatred. It simply isn't in her nature and in the end it is she who forgives rather than feel the need to ask for forgiveness. All the performances are first-rate and in the title role Judi Dench is simply phenomenal. This could so easily have become a display of actorly histrionics but Dench underplays almost to the point of invisibility. We certainly never see Dench up there on the screen but the incredible woman she is playing. Her performance is heart-breaking but then so is the whole film. Oscars are just not good enough.

The film starts with the message that it is based on true events. Although you might wonder what was changed for the film, you soon forget that and accept it as a whole. In short it was brilliant. It could have been a predictable story but instead it had other dimensions and took unexpected directions with strong characters and some humour. I thought I knew an outline beforehand and was pleasantly surprised when that part was covered in the first twenty minutes. It was intriguing where the story would take us and that happened a few more times later. In addition to Philomena's journey, there was also Martin Sixsmith's journey from the beginning as just a detached journalist doing a human interest story on someone, whom he thought was beneath him, to being totally involved and offering not to publish it. To illustrate the depths of this film you can see how it attacks cruel, narrow-minded, sanctimonious Catholicism and at the same time shows how the faith gave strength to Philomena and the ability to forgive rather than to wreak vengeance. The acting was totally convincing. It is going to be a competitive year but Judy must be up for another Oscar. Just watching Steve Coogan's almost imperceptible expressions of irritation as Philomena told him the interminable plot of the book she had just been reading, was wonderful. This is definitely the best film I have seen all year. After writing this I read the interview with Martin Sixsmith on the Guardian web-site. It fills in more detail about Michael Hess (Anthony Lee) but confirms the whole truth of the story.

*****May Contain Spoilers***** This heart-warming and humorous drama screened at TIFF this year and I was lucky enough to see this premiere, and this film stars Dame Judi Dench, Steve Coogan, Mare Winningham, & Michelle Fairley. "Philomena" comes to us from director Stephen Frears, and he has been a very successful director for a very long time with films the likes of "The Queen" & "High Fidelity" going all the way back to "The Grifters" & "Dangerous Liaisons".

This tale tells of a woman in her mid to late 60's named Philomena, and she is and has been in search of her long lost son for many years. As a young teenager she got into trouble and gave birth to a baby boy out of wedlock. Now in a last chance effort for Philomena she contacts a disgraced journalist to enlist his help in finding her son. This writer is Martin Sixsmith and he is coincidently very much in need of something in his life at this moment, and together he and Philomena embark on a journey of parental heartache while tackling new frontiers within themselves.

Well people I will start by saying that director Stephen Frears has picked up right where he left off with "The Queen". He seemed to have struggled here and there for a few years, but he is at the top of his game for the second time in the last two attempts. This filmmaker has created drama that is compelling, laugh out loud funny, and solidly entertaining all at the same time, and his direction unfolds the story in a smooth and even manner. Frears knows exactly when and where to be serious, he knows when to lighten the story, and most of all he always keeps the film interesting. There is a plot reveal in the beginning of the second act and it really could've dampened the mood and tone of "Philomena", but instead this director constantly takes us into fresh and enjoyable territory.

The screenplay is delivered by star Steve Coogan & Jeff Pope and together they have countless television writing credits to their names, but I am totally shocked at just how fulfilling a feature film that they have crafted with "Philomena". These screenwriters consistently fill this film with doses of wit and charm, but those moments surround a very interesting and investigating tale. They have created a story full of rich and full characters, and these characters deliver their lines brilliantly. The spoken dialogue is out-and-out bold at times, and even some of the humorous lines had quite an edge to them. On top of all of this the movie is very touching and sincere, and you'd better bring a box of Kleenex when you see this because many were weeping all around me. People will be crying for moments both happy and sad as the tale plays out, but the entire movie will resonate with most people for a while after the end credits have stopped rolling.

This takes me to the driving force of this feature, and that would be to stars Judi Dench & Steve Coogan. Dame Judi Dench delivers to us a wonderful turn on the silver screen, and her performance is quite unique because few can find the line between warm, cordial, and direct all in the same film. She very much sheds her usual hard edge in favor a lovely and humane role. She opens the audience up to a motherly love and passion for finding a child that has been long since gone, and at the same time she swears and brings a blunt truthfulness to many scenes throughout the movie.

Then Steve Coogan trades in his usual straight comedic portrayal and instead gives us what I would say is his best work on the big screen to date. His work as Martin Sixsmith is a wonderful slice of drama, and his combination of serious & light humor couldn't have worked more brilliantly. Coogan must have had a real passion for this project because he serves as screenwriter and producer as well as star, and you can see that passion when you're watching the end result. He is a character that is maturing into a new spot in his life, and to me as an actor he has accomplished the exact same thing.

Now together Dench & Coogan are quite a character all their own, and the brilliant banter between them was definitely the motor that drove this story. "Philomena" thrives on the great and constant confrontations between Martin and his older counterpart, and these two performers actually get the best acting out of each other. The more that they are together in the film the better the movie gets, and as the film plays on they both learn and grow as people because of their interaction together. Just like "Midnight Run" this movie doesn't work without both the ying and the yang, and would have fallen apart without cooperation.

At right around 1 hour and 40 minutes "Philomena" was nothing short of a bright shining jewel of a film. This is one of the most moving and pleasantly constructed features that I have seen all year, and I could easily sit through this one again when it gets a wide push across the country. The two lead characters work so incredibly well together that they should consider working with each other more often. If you are a Judi Dench fan this movie is a must-see, if you are a Steve Coogan fan this is a must-see, and if you are a fan of truly great movies¬Öthen this feature is for you as well. This movie is absolute perfection & that's why Nick's Reel Screen Review is a perfect 4 stars out of 4, and that's for one of the year's best in "Philomena".

Steve Coogan is in danger of becoming a good actor. After the dull thud  that was Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, 2013 has seen Coogan turn heads as  Paul Raymond in The Look of Love and more than hold his own in What  Massie Knew. And now comes Philomena, which he co-wrote, co-produced  and stars alongside Judi Dench. 
Based on the 'human interest' story of Philomena Lee (Dench) written by  out of favour journalist Martin Sixsmith (Coogan), Philomena recounts  the true story of a devout Catholic girl who was abandoned by her  father at a convent when she fell pregnant out of wedlock. The nuns at  the convent, while abusing the many girls in their care and subjecting  them to what accounted to slavery, ran a sideline business in selling  their babies to rich Americans. Fifty years after the theft of her son,  Philomena, riddled with good old Catholic guilt, goes in search of her  son aided by Sixsmith but the nuns, not content with their initial  abuse and kidnapping, weave a shroud of lies to thwart her. 
For those who have seen Peter Mullan's excellent The Magdalene Sisters,  or read the news any time over the past couple of decades, you'll be  very familiar with the many indiscretions of the Catholic church and  the multitudinous cover-ups that have ensued. If ever there was need  for yet another reason not to be Catholic, Philomena is it. But Coogan  and director Stephen Frears are at pains not to make this a  catholic-bashing exercise. Wrongs are highlighted and they cannot  change the opinions of the viewers, but judgment of specific  individuals is held at bay. In the final act, though it's not a huge  shock, there is hope given for humanity, regardless of religion. 
Philomena is a simple story of huge consequence and heartbreak. So  often one finds oneself thinking evil thoughts and relief that it  happened to someone else, and that is a fine achievement of the  director. He unravels the story as he loosens the binds on his  characters. Certain elements feel too good to be true and we find  ourselves dreading the Hollywood veneer that often coats 'based on  truth' stories, but Frears never falls into that trap and stands fast  to tell the truth. Frears is back to the form of 2006's award-laden The  Queen, and Philomena, complete with another Dame in the title role,  looks like taking more gold before the award season is out. 
Judi Dench is wonderful here, but then how often is she anything but?  She brings much gentle humour to the role of a woman who has lived a  very simple life of toil, secrets and hidden emotions, who is unaware  that the drinks on her flight are free. It is easy to view her as a  woman from the backwaters with no experience of the real world, and  then she drops statement that makes it perfectly clear she is aware of  the world around her; she just chooses not to engage in all of its  activities and attitudes. It is an uncomplicated performance that feels  very true, very real and is very affecting. One hopes that the real  Philomena is at ease and comforted by Dench's respectful portrayal. 
Coogan continues to be a revelation. Gone (finally) is his reliance on  Alan Partridge idiosyncrasies and instead he has climbed into a  character that is real and flawed in a natural way. It's not a  performance that is going to make jaws hit the floor but he plays  assuredly against Dench, ensuring she has something more than a plank  to react to. His next big screen outing, Northern Soul with Antonia  Thomas (Sunshine on Leith) is suddenly a very attractive prospect. 
Philomena is one of those fine cinema experiences that leaves one  questioning one's own capacity for resilience and forgiveness. Whilst  the crimes are heinous, is anything truly unforgivable? More than that,  Philomena is a film that lingers. It is never going to have the wow  factor of, say, Gravity or bring forth the smiles Sunshine on Leith,  but it is fine story worthy of your attention an accolades. 
Just not if you're a certain type of nun.

Fabulous piece of work by all concerned. We get to see all sides of a single story without excessive back flips, cartwheels and other cinematic tricks. Coogan has got the measure of this story and pulls off a truly convincing performance as Sixsmith whilst Dench almost manages to do an entire film with a dialect....occasionally lapses but you may not notice. This is a real tear-jerker at points, thought provoking at many junctures and full of ironic humour. That's quite a feat and the more enjoyable for being so. I presume the timescale is roughly ten years ago so attempts at getting tech right for the period is still possible - amazing that so recent history can seem like centuries ago when we see old technology in use. I can see this film being a 'classic' long before it reaches any real age. Its the 21st century version of a 19th century Dickens tale, that it is.

This was a great film. I haven't stopped thinking and talking about it since I saw it earlier today. This is a story that needed to be told: so much better than the typical blockbusters we are force-fed day by day. A very meaningful and poignant tale about what goes on in the heart of man and the secrets that can change lives if only known. My husband and I hugely enjoy the British style of acting with its dry humour and evident realism. A movie which portrays a reality that would be very close to home for thousands of people. Steve Coogan played his part very well. Judi Dench has excellent comic timing, which I haven't forgotten, having watched her in UK sitcoms in the old days. A must see. Well done to all involved.

You've read the story. You may even have read the book. A few years ago former ITN reporter Martin Sixsmith took an Irish widow on a quest to find the illegitimate son she was forcibly parted from 50 years earlier. The Magdalen Sisters at the convent where she had the baby (and where he was sold on for adoption in the US) are coldly unhelpful, but Sixsmith uses his journalistic contacts to follow up the adoption. As Philomena is quick to admit, Anthony did far better in the US than he would have done in Ireland, but she longs to know that he has missed her as much as she, for all his life, has missed him. You somehow know that this story is not going to have a happy ending. 

Judi Dench gives a lovely low-key performance as the painfully unsophisticated, doggedly determined Irishwoman. Steve Coogan totally casts off his comic 'baggage' to play Sixsmith, the initially reluctant Sancho Panza on this seemingly hopeless quest. As in THE QUEEN and THE KING'S SPEECH, director Stephen Frears gets the mood exactly right with a careful attention to period details and the nuances of this slight but gut-wrenching story. 

Philomena's story is a circular one, which ends back at the convent where Anthony was born and then torn away from her. One of the nuns from 50 years ago is still alive and totally unrepentant at the callousness with which these sinful young mothers were treated (dozens of them, perhaps hundreds). Martin Sixsmith's rage in this scene comes across powerfully in the script Steve Coogan co-wrote.

I don't personally believe in an afterlife but I found myself thinking that perhaps women like these heartless Fundamentalist nuns are the virgin houris with which fanatics from another faith are rewarded (in Hell, obviously: it cannot possibly be Heaven) for flying planes into skyscrapers and blowing themselves up in marketplaces. They somehow deserve each other.

Philomena is undoubtedly a film and a story that pulls at our heartstrings. (Do hearts have strings? Seems I'm falling back into old fashioned rhetoric.) It's the story of great injustice, cruelty, that was doled out to young girls of 50+ years ago who had the misfortune in society's eyes to become pregnant out of wedlock. It's easy enough to say that this attitude is a byproduct of the Irish Catholic Church, but that would be like saying that antisemitism was German. It would be a misreading of both history and the facts. Thus, although the nuns and priests who were complicit here are not given a pass (you should have heard the quiet condemnatory outbursts from my fellow audience members) this is not a story of the Catholic Church vs. the more caring world, but rather a look back in time to a series of widely played events whose ramifications still echo today.

This is the story of one woman, Philomena, as portrayed in her old age by Judi Dench. She is a stoical, quiet, but yet lighthearted woman who has an undercurrent of great sadness. We begin the story with her finally telling her daughter about the son she had at age 18 who was taken from her and adopted away. She had never spent a day in the ensuing 47 years without thinking of him and at last admits that she desperately needs to seek him out, "I just want to know that he was loved." We follow along on her journey, driven along by her daughter catching the attention of a journalist, Martin Sixsmith, who is at loose ends and rather reluctantly agrees to help her in her search using all the considerable skills of a long professional career. This is a true story in that there really is a Philomena Lee, whose son, Anthony, was taken from her at age three by the same nuns who had been sheltering them, and using her for free labor. And there really is a Martin Sixsmith, the journalist who helped her. The story takes some flights of fancy, playing with the facts as I understand from interviews with Philomena Lee herself, to keep it watchable, but the underlying story elements are correct and the emotions are authentic.

But what makes this film so very watchable are the performances. Judi Dench once again proves that she is one the finest working actors of our age. Her performance is absolutely exquisite. I found myself almost holding my breath in a few of the emotion laden closeups of her face. Steve Coogan, as Sixsmith, is also very, very good. And very much worth mentioning is Sophie Kennedy Clark who plays Philomena as a young woman. But as I frequently find with a film which contains such stellar leading actors, the supporting actors also all do a very fine job. I even like the glorified extras who played the hotel staff.

Much effort has been made to assure that this film is entertaining. It has humor, twists and turns, and real drama. I don't think anyone will be leaving the theater with a happy little gait. However, I think I can promise you will be profoundly moved as well as thoroughly entertained.

Real world meets religious malady. A young girl's child is taken from her and fifty years later she enquires about his whereabouts. The catholic church (the very same who protects and nourishes child rapists) thought it a grave sin for a girl to become pregnant out of wedlock and went out of their way to stop her. Her paths are crossed with a shrewd journalist and a voyage of discovery begins.

I found very poignant that two such opposites, in terms of personalities came together. Without this combination this endeavour would have been an exercise in futility. The on screen chemistry of Dench and Coogan is superb where when required each will take the lead and the other will back off to give the space required.

A tragic true story, filled with emotion and conveys the spirit of a torn mother. Philomena is plain utterly lovable.

Steve Coogan has said that Philomena is his reaction against cynicism - his attempt to make an honest and fundamentally sincere film. The biggest compliment that can be paid to him is that, in these goals, he has succeeded.

It tells the story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench, who is as brilliant as ever), an elderly Irish woman whose child was taken away from her 50 years ago by an austere Catholic convent. Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) is the cynical, know-it-all journalist turned government spin doctor, recently sacked, who is on the look out for a story. After a chance encounter at a party, Sixsmith reluctantly takes up the 'human interest' story of Philomena's search for her son, Anthony.

The key to Philomena is the relationship between the titular character and Sixsmith. And it works. It really works, in fact. His cynicism, bordering on arrogance, is matched perfectly by her simple and completely sincere belief in common human decency. It could easily have been overly sentimental, but Judi Dench in particular does a remarkable job of keeping it grounded. 

There's some very dark stuff here, and it's a testament to the script that the film does not become overwhelmed by it. The Magdalene laundries were awful places, yet this story is not about revenge. I was almost cheering when, at the end, Sixsmith gives one particularly odious nun a piece of his mind. But moments later Philomena accosts him and gives me a slap on the wrist. She does not want revenge or angry confrontation. She just wants the truth. It's a remarkable act of forgiveness, and one that, like Sixsmith, I could not agree with. But then, I'm just another cynical and bitter atheist. I have to say, this film made me angry at myself for being one. And yet it also made me pleased I wasn't a Catholic. Go figure. 

Philomena is an incredible and heartfelt story. It's desperately sad, yet never overly sentimental. There's some genuinely funny moments, mainly emanating from the contrast between the wide-eyed and refreshing simplicity of Philomena's world view and the weary wryness of Sixsmith. If you get a chance, see it.

"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time."

Philomena surpassed my expectations considering I thought it would be just another pairing of two unlikely companions on a road trip (the terrible Guilt Trip comes to mind here), but I was surprised to see how well the two main actors played off each other sharing a great chemistry on screen and how well balanced the script was, allowing me to feel completely moved by the story. First of all Philomena is based on a tragic and upsetting true story, but somehow director Stephen Frears (The Queen) manages to tell it with such grace that it feels subtle and humbling at the same time. It never feels like Frears is trying to manipulate the audience through all the sentimentality, on the contrary he treats the subject with light heartedness. A lot of credit has to be given to Steve Coogan who adapted the script along with Jeff Pope (it's actually ironic that it was written by a "Pope" considering how bad the Catholic Church comes off here) because it is extremely well written delivering genuine moments with an honest tearjerker. The emotional weight was handled perfectly. I would have never thought a film dealing with such a dark subject could be so inspiring and uplifting, but it was mainly because Philomena decided to respond to the cruelty and injustice very differently than we would (which would be with outrage), and chose to forgive instead. That is how they turned a sad story into an entertaining and enlightened one. Simply put Philomena is a clever film with genuine emotions.

The film is based on the true story written by former BBC correspondent and political journalist, Martin Sixsmith (played in this film by Steve Coogan), The Lost Child of Philomena Lee. After a political scandal which leaves Martin without a job, he accepts to write a human interest story when he hears about Philomena (Judi Dench), a woman in her late 60's who had her son taken away when she was forced to live in a Catholic convent after getting pregnant as a young teenager in Ireland. Martin begins investigating her story which eventually leads to some surprising discoveries and a trip to America. Martin and Philomena learn several things about each other despite their differences and uncover some astonishing answers along the way. 

Philomena is a highly entertaining and feel good movie which reminded me a lot of Saving Mr. Banks in the way the story was told without being manipulative and looking for the easy emotions. Steve Coogan and Judi Dench also proved to be quite a powerful duo in this enjoyable film. Philomena is also extremely well balanced, mixing genuinely funny moments with dramatic ones. It also includes mystery elements and the actual procedural part of the film is what hooked me the most. I enjoyed the way in which the discoveries were being made and how they reacted to each new revelation. Philomena is a charming film that deserves the four Oscar nominations it received. The two main actors are given complex characters with a lot of depth and they deliver brilliant performances, however the secondary cast doesn't do much more than get the procedural moving. Philomena deserves to be considered amongst the best films of 2013.

What if one of us had a child and suddenly lost him because of our actions? Philomena it's one answer to this question. The story shows us the raw way that so many girls we're blamed for a "crime" they hadn't commit and how easily they we're separated from their child as another punishment for what they supposedly had done. Philomena astonishes for being a real person. The lady existed and was present during the 2014 Oscars. That adds a lot to the movie, because it's not some cute old lady with an outstanding ability to forgive that Steve Coogan invented. Philomena it's real and so it's her story. For that the movie isn't a surprise the entire time, but an amazing piece of reality brought to the big screen. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan did a great job bringing it and as a result we're presented with a delicious movie about the power of love from a mother to a son and a woman that didn't loose her smile, her heart or her soul despite the events. It will be difficult not to connect to them and some of the actions of the son will make us wonder how much our genetic code matters in who we are.

"Philomena" tells the story of a deeply-religious, elderly woman named Philomena (Judi Dench) who is content on searching for her long-lost son after being forced to give him up for adoption 50 years ago. Aided by a down-on-his-luck, secular journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), Philomena embarks on a journey of a lifetime to rediscover her long-kept secret. Although I have failed to realize it until recently, these biopics/dramas have really grounded a special place in my heart. "Philomena" fits in beautifully among the class of "The King's Speech," "12 Years a Slave," "Saving Mr. Banks," and "Behind the Candelabra." Although the story of Philomena Lee is lesser known, her story is one of the most beautiful. At first I thought the movie would be quite boring, dragging on like "Lincoln" did. I was wrong. Judi Dench gives a performance well Oscar-worthy, perfectly capturing the flurry of emotions that would overcome a woman in her position, while Steve Coogan serves as a great complement on her journey. After having sex out of wedlock, Philomena is forced to serve the Catholic Church, working in a convent to repay the sister nuns for delivering her baby. However, as punishment, she is only allowed to see her son one hour a day. One day, new parents arrive and take her child away, leaving her heartbroken and without her son. Fast-forward to 50 years later, Philomena is a deeply religious, empathetic woman who now has a daughter. In search of her long-lost son, she employs the service of Martin Sixsmith, who had lost his job with the BBC. And so the journey begins with Philomena and Martin, like mother and son on a journey to discover a mother and her son.

What I enjoyed most about this movie is how simple and non-dramatic it is. The film never comes off as unrealistic, not too stretched-out. Lasting just an hour and 40 minutes, "Philomena" tells a story that makes you just as emotionally tied to the journey as Philomena is. The use of sprinkled-in humor adds some more smiles and laughs to the plot, but more importantly serves to demonstrate the mother-son complex that seems to build between Philomena and Martin during the movie. In helping Philomena on this journey, we can see his own journey come to a head. He begins as a proud, stern journalist who claims to want nothing to do with a human interest story. However, by the end, we see his growth as a human being, no longer wanting to publish her story. He begins to respect the human interest story, seeing how sometimes it is the simple things that can be the most extravagant. An unlikely hero, elderly Philomena, helps turn his life around, showing her true colors of wisdom and love throughout. When he is being rude and condescending, she teaches him, saying, "Be nice to people on your way up, because chances are you'll meet them on your way down." 

In the very beginning of the film, they begin at the convent where Philomena had last seen her son. The nuns claim to have lost all of the records, except her contract to never look for her son. Coincidence? After a long search, Philomena and Martin take to the United States where they finally discover her son to be a former government worker who had already died. Even more interesting, Martin had previously met him at a White House event. Philomena is overcome with pure joy and tears as Martin recalls him having "a firm handshake and polite manner." It is amazing that such general details mean so much to Philomena. With no other knowledge of her son, these seemingly meaningless details mean the world to Philomena, reminding us of how important the little things in life can be. The film beautifully comes full-circle, returning Philomena and Martin back to the convent after learning that her son's dying wish was to be buried back in Ireland near his mother. All along the son had searched for the mother, while the mother had searched for her son. Just knowing this is enough for Philomena. When Martin learns of the nuns' determination to keep mother and son apart, he lashes out at the elderly nun. However, Philomena does not share this angst. Rather, she forgives. In some of this final dialogue, Phiomena describes her forgiveness:

"Philomena: But I don't wanna hate people. I don't wanna be like you. Look at you. Martin Sixsmith: I'm angry. Philomena: Must be exhausting"

At last, Philomena kneels before the grave of her son, finally being reunited with him. And so the journey goes. Mother and son together at last. Through this journey, we learn to laugh, to appreciate the small things, to recognize the close ties between mother and son, and to forgive. "Philomena" is one of the most heart-warming films of 2013. In what has become a crowded Best Picture race, "Philomena" is surely close in the discussion. While it lacks the special effects, costume design, and popularity of the other films, "Philomena" is sure to stand out in my heart, regardless of its Oscar fate¬Ö.reminding us of that human touch and connection in a much more realistic, heart-warming, and successful fashion than "Her," "Philomena" is a must see for any individual of the human race.

PHILOMENA is an undoubtedly sentimental film, the tale of a quest by the eponymous heroine (Judi Dench) to discover what happened to her son, who had been taken away from her in the mid-Fifties by Irish nuns, and sold for adoption in the United States. Aided (or should that be abetted) by Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) she begins her journey in England, travels to Ireland and the United States and returns to the convent where her son was originally given away. Stephen Frears' film has its serious points to make about the strictures of the Catholic Church, especially in days gone by, when its dedication to religion rode roughshod over people's feelings. There is a climactic scene involving an elderly nun (Barbara Jefford) that sums up this viewpoint. However the quest narrative is enlivened by two delightful central performances: Dench is alternately humorous, naive and highly moving as Philomena, while Coogan gives quite simply the best characterization I have ever seen from him during his career. He has always had the makings of a good serious actor; this film vindicates that promise. On the other hand the script has a fair share of good jokes at the British and American people's collective expense. Definitely worth watching,

Based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist Martin Sixsmith, 'Philomena' is A Gem Of A Film! It narrates a heart-breaking true-story of a lost mother & son, profoundly. A Wonderful Film in all respects.

'Philomena' Synopsis: A world-weary political journalist picks up the story of a woman's search for her son, who was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and was forced to live in a convent.

'Philomena' is marvelously written by Steve Coogan & Jeff Pope. Its so emotional & so engaging. Not for a single moment, does the Writing fall apart. A job very well-done! Stephen Frears's Direction is excellent. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are brilliant. 

Performance-Wise: Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, delivers a stupendous performance. As usual, the legendary actress sinks her teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith, lends great support. 

On the whole, 'Philomena' is a must see.

A bittersweet tale of a mother's search for a loved one from her past forms the core of Philomena, a real life semibiography of atonement and forgiveness amid ignorance and the passage of time. As directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, My Beautiful Laundrette) from a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith's book, "The Lost Child of Philomena Lee", it features impressive acting and an affecting story.

Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is an unemployed news writer in Britain who is searching for direction in his life. At the same time, an elderly woman, Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), prays in church and commemorates an anniversary of the pain and loss of her illegitimate son. She recalls the distant memories of working at an abbey in Ireland and being forced to give her young boy for adoption. Her plight makes its way to Sixsmith who at first is not interested in human interest stories, but Philomena's anguish kindles a curiosity within Sixsmith and eventually grows into a crusade that has the support of a publisher. Stymied by false leads and lost records, Philomena's desperate search for her adult son leads to a revelation and the truth despite the dogmatic doctrines of a holy institution.

Simultaneously a love story of a mother for her child and an investigative mystery, this is essentially a two person play, in which Philomena and Martin are contrasts in personality and background-she has a na√Øvety about her while he is a born cynic. That she must experience a full spectrum of emotions during her journey from shame to anticipation to despondency contrasts with Martin's determination, anger, and frustration.

As expected, Dench (Skyfall, Notes on a Scandal) excels in the sensitive role of an older woman anxious to reconnect with her son. She even gets the nuances and behavior of a woman who has had a sheltered, broken life and lacks the sophistication and social graces of normalcy. This detail is nice texture to her character. Like the sole photograph she has of her son, she clings to memories and hopes of redemption. Coogan is quite convincing as the determined reporter, quite a contrast to his comedic roots in British television and film.

There is liberal use of flashbacks to show Philomena's life as a teenage girl. Sometimes dredging old memories can cause great pain not only for Philomena, but for other people who hold clues to her son's whereabouts. What become of him? What kind of relationships and profession did he have in life? And perhaps, most importantly, did he ever wonder about his birth mother? The film shows how life can be a series of events punctuated by remarkable links and coincidences particularly in one revelatory moment that serves as a remarkable thread that binds the principals together. Some antiquated themes recall the stigma of being an unmarried mother and the practice of adopting illegitimate children through the church. In some ways this film is the flip side to The Cider House Rules.

It calls into question how much an institution like the Catholic Church may or may not have been complicit in the knowledge or whereabouts of her son. It seems too obvious to place responsibility and condemn the Catholic Church, the very foundation of faith, and its nuns as villains. In fact you wish you could learn much more about the motives and thinking of the older nuns and countless other nameless victims that passed through the abbey; Philomena is but one story. What about Philomena's life beyond the abbey? We see that she also has a grown daughter, and yet we don't have those details.

After all that has transpired, the detective work, and globetrotting from Europe to the United States, there is only the love between a mother and her son. In the end, a mother's hope and a reporter's quest become a heartfelt search for the truth, a truth born of love that transcends time.

Turns out Steve Coogan is not the untalented hack "Hamlet 2" and his other outings would lead you to believe. In a smart and nuanced portrayal of a London high society castoff opposite the peerless Judy Dench, his understated performance allows the audience to feel rather than just observe his character's emotions. And emotions aplenty there are. The story follows the true story of an Irish nurse's breaking of a fifty-year silence about an unwed pregnancy and it horrific aftermath as it twists across the sea to Washington DC and its suburbs and back. Ironically, Coogan's editor (after a life in the halls of power, his character is reduced to writing this presumably puff piece) berates him to define the woman's story in terms of "goodies" and "baddies" while the film itself allows no such simplicity. It may be perceived as a deserved attack on the Irish Catholic Church but it does not really play out that way with Dench's nurse absolution of the convent that either took her in or imprisoned her depending on your point of view. The beauty of the film precisely results from it allowing you have that point of view. It may be a terrible date movie but its a great movie to discuss afterwards and that discussion will be both heated and satisfying. In short, mature audiences will thorough enjoy this British import and should see it in the theaters as an inducement for more thoughtful intelligent fair and less "Grown-ups 2".

After losing his job as a Labour Party adviser, English journalist Martin Sixsmith is lost and doesn't know what to do: neither resuming his book about Russian History nor writing about human interests' stories are attractive options. One day he meets Philomena Lee's daughter and she tells him about her mother, a sixty year-old lady who is looking for her son, given in adoption 50 years ago by the nuns of an Irish convent. Although he is not interested in the story, an editorial is willing to publish it. From now on Martin and Philomena will start a journey to find out what happened with that boy.

It's a tough yet beautiful story, specially for the bond that grows between the leading characters, both from very different backgrounds and life stories almost opposite. I admired Philomena's faith the most: despite all odds she shows all the time that she believes in church and in the kindness of people (I wouldn't, for sure)

You will love this movie.

When it has an excellent script, great direction and brilliant performances - especially by Judy Dench. How good is she? At seventy-seven this amazing actress has lost non of her skill and can hold an audience spellbound with her amazing ability to interpret the moment perfectly in every scene. I was a bit worried about Steve Coogan at first, but he pulled off a remarkably restrained but strong performance. Steve also wrote the script, which took me on an emotional roller coaster at times - in a good way. Whilst there is plenty of emotion and drama in this story, it is laced with enough humour to leave the audience feeling positive about the outcome. A must-see for anyone interested in a great example of film story telling.

The story of the Magdalene laundries is not exactly a chapter of Irish history that anyone wants to hang on a wall. For more than 200 years, the Magdalene laundries were an asylum engineered to incarcerate young girls who were either promiscuous or prostitutes or the victims of rape. It was little more than a sweatshop in which the girls were forced into hard labor ¬ñ usually doing laundry - for a certain term and were regarded like inmates. These asylums were sanctioned by the Catholic Church, operated by nuns and privately funded by the government. Many girls were guilty of nothing. Some were pregnant and had children and were only allowed to see their children for an hour a day. Even still, a child could be adopted and sent away without the mother's knowledge or consent. You should know that this is not a story out of The Dark Ages. In fact, the very last of the Magdalene Laundries closed its doors in 1996.

Don't panic, though. Stephen Frear's film Philomena is not an expose of the Magdalene laundries. That story has already been told in Peter Mullan's hard-bitten 2003 drama The Magdalene Sisters. They do, however, serve as a backdrop to the story of one person whose life was affected, for better and for worse, by her time locked away behind the walls of the laundries.

Philomena tells the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish catholic woman who spent most of her life regretting one fateful event that never left her heart. A half century ago Philomena made a mistake, the consequences of which have haunted her ever since. Back in 1951, she was a teenager. She went to a carnival. She met a boy. Things got serious. Nine months later she was living in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea where she gave birth to a son she named Anthony. Later, she was forced to stand by helplessly as her son was adopted by an American couple. Philomena, a devout Catholic, believed that her separation from her son was penance for her sin. Yet, it is something that she has never come to terms with. Half a century later, her sad eyes are a window into painful memories and regret.

Philomena, played in a lovely performance by Judi Dench, wants to know what ever happened to her son, and finds herself in the company of an out-of-work BBC reporter named Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film) who, at first, sees the old girl's story as a sellable human interest piece. Anyone with eyes can see that she is much more than just a sound bite. She's warm-hearted, a bit na√Øve, with a stubborn resolve, yet she's not a standard crabby old bat. She's a cozy soul with a twee Irish accent and too often the perpetrator of TMI.

At first, Martin is purely professional, but as the deep wounds of Philomena's story unearth, he finds himself taking it personally. He is at odds with her passionate faith, because he himself is a newly-minted atheist. He labels himself confidently, but we sense that he hasn't completely rid himself of all doubts. The two are not on equal ground. Martin's mind is a flurry of intellectual cynicism. He's a college-educated journalist who seems to have a quip, an aside, and an answer for just about everything. Philomena, meanwhile, is earnest and straightforward. She sees the world in terms that are purely black and white.

The search for Philomena's son becomes an awakening for both she and Martin. Travelling from rural Ireland to England and to American, the two dig up bits and pieces about Anthony, some of which are a relief, others are painful. What she finds will not be revealed here, except to say that it is not what we expect. Little by little, bit by bit, information about her son comes to light; yet, all Philomena really wants to know is if he ever wondered about her.

What is interesting about Philomena is that this is not a hard, maudlin melodrama. Frears allows a good deal of humor, especially in regards to Philomena's awakening to the rude shocks of the modern world. She's surprisingly calm, especially in her attitude about the sexual encounter that produced her son.

Judi Dench, whose presence in a film is welcomed no matter what she's doing, gives one of her best performances as a woman whose eyes betray a weary heart. Through the years, her missing child has never left her mind or her heart, yet the experience hasn't destroyed her spirit. She is a woman devoted to God, un-embittered by her experience that keeps her mind on the task and won't allow herself to be pushed into outbursts of emotion.

The outbursts are reserved for her travelling companion. Martin reacts more or less the way we would. He's outraged by what he learns about Philomena's experience. He's a man who has slipped away from God in the cold of a brutal world (remember, he's a journalist) and he can't understand her unbending faith. You expect a film that is emotional, but you don't expect one that brings in questions of faith and the meaning of God. During one roadside rant about the meaning of God, he asks her if she really believes all that she claims, and he is stunned by her straightforward, "Yes." Philomena is a very moving film. It is touching when it needs to be, humorous when it's appropriate and comes to an ending that never feels like a manipulation. If there is one weakness it is probably that it leaves several questions unanswered. Those are difficult to discuss without spoilers, but you walk out in deep discussions over some of the issues it raises. This is a beautiful film about the chasms of time, the measure of lingering heartache and the manner in which old wound are dealt with.
