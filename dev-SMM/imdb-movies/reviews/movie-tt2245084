### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.

Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.

Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.

The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.

Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.

The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.

The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.

A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.

If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.

Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.

To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out "OW" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say "I'm satisfied with your work" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's "Cliche" "awful" "boring". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. 

So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think.

The last time I left a cinema feeling anything close to this elated was after Gravity. My heart was racing, I felt so joyful. I never feel like this after a film. Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my No.1, main stream, animated film. 

I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining, action packed, emotional roller-coaster only to see half a dozen vicious reviews ... I feel so somber. I can't believe anyone would loath this film to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site. It was an absolute joy. The whole cinema was ecstatic, both kids and adults. 

I have a 7 year old boy, and even without being a dad, I'd still love this film. Hope it picks up the awards (Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA etc etc) it deserves.

Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself.

I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I have in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews.. "Not a kids film"?? kids would go mental for this.

Animation was nothing short of exquisite

Comedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies)

Story line was really great too

Also made me cry a little... meh

please please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it.

Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. 

Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? 

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!

Having the opportunity to view this film twice really helped me get a perspective of the film that many may not have right now. This film is not FROZEN... it is not filled with songs or magical snowmen.

But this film has something else, it has family, friends, action , drama, and most of all a big robot named Baymax who will examine your funny bone and sense of humor . The film shows what kind of magic Disney can do with super hero's . The story is fast paced for the most part and the laughs and entertainment are high flying, that is if you like heights , but if you don't its OK because this movie knows how to get down also. 

The characters work well with each other, kinda like the scooby doo crowd but twist that with a bit of incredibles and you have a fun filled, action packed movie that will delight boys and girls of all ages and keep parents happy that they took their child to see this. I know my family and I enjoyed it twice and will be back for multiple viewings.

Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros. 

5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name. 

Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's cute and he knows it. 

Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace. 

Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.

Contains spoilers, pass this review if you don't want to see any spoilers, such as end scenes and more.

I actually wasn't planning to watch this particular movie, until my friends told me it was a good movie and that I should watch it.

I decided to try it and see how it goes. I instantly fell in love with Baymax. He's huggable and simply adorable. Along with that, he's a HEALTHCARE companion! It was certainly a HILARIOUS movie, and I enjoyed every last bit of it.

I love how that Hiro, originally a boy who was interested only in bot fights, decides to do something big- starting with joining the nerd lab. There. he meets people like Wasabi, Fred, Go-Go, and more. 

This movie also played with your emotions. And no, not just a little bit, but a lot. Disney seriously did a good job doing that. This movie was one of those that actually almost made me cry. Near the end, Baymax had supposedly "died" and that made me very emotional. I was so happy that at the end, Hiro managed to make another Baymax using the chip the original Baymax had left behind. 

All I have to say is that this movie is definitely one worth watching, especially if you like humorous animated films.

I have seen this animated film a number of times now, and have not grown to become sick of it. I love the plot, the characters (especially my favorite, GoGo) and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for Best Animated Film 2015. The only downside is that my favorite male character, Tadashi, dies, but I understand why the writers included this in the plot, for it had a huge impact on the film and brought great reflection to - especially - Hiro Hamada. The idea that the overall 'hero' is a non-threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further interest to the film, for he ends up saving just about all of the protagonists lives, not to mention he is a very appropriate character for all audiences, as well is the film entirely. All in all, I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence, in my opinion, and look forward to any future works that will come out of this film!

I refuse to believe that this is an awful movie that users around here with such abysmal ratings and thoughts wants you to believe it is. If you happen to read those reviews you'll find that they are only perturbed that the movie and it's story is predictable, filled with clichés, fast paced or being an idiotic film or the fact that they still don't like the idea that Marvel is being owned by the Disney Company and it's certain characters have received some brief changes.

I'm really starting to think that those users didn't take the movie seriously, just because a certain movie happens to be a "Disney" movie it does not mean that every movie from them should be the considered for doing the same typical actions. Big Hero 6 delivers more than just of those prejudices for what Disney is famous for.

If you really want to know how the movie was, let me "just a little bit" tell my experience with it. First of all the beginning of movie worked fine, it showed a good-spirited brotherhood with Tadashi for caring his little brother Hiro and giving him his thoughts of what he really should do with this gift.

Hiro as the main character reminded me a lot of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, sure just like him Hiro was a flawed character but in the movie it showed him how he shouldn't be squandering his gifts as well. I didn't find him bratty or annoying, you will find that deeply inside of him he's a good person despite being a little shy to show it.

The supporting characters are not ghosts or unnecessary filler they are indeed one of the important keys to this movie and its title. We do get to learn them well enough. What's wrong with a movie that happens to be a little fast paced? Fast paced movies can be entertaining too guys, remember Inception? But unlike that movie I got to learn the supporting characters well and they're likable as well with their own personalities. Just to inform it wasn't that extremely fast to follow.

What about Baymax? He is in my personal opinion one of the best robots in movies I have seen. I was glad to see him being both likable and smart at the same time. I had so much fun to see him learning about the humanity from both Hiro and his friends especially the Fist-Bump scenes.

Of course this movie was based upon the Comic books but I don't really understand why some people think that it's title should have been changed just because it didn't become the movie they expected. Look the movie is about how the team got created in the first place while showing a good story and reason to their build up. I strongly disagree that it should have been called Big Hero 1 or 2 no, no, no you must be kidding here :P.

But most importantly I'm happy to see that Big Hero 6 managed to deliver good moralities. I haven't seen a Disney movie having so many good thoughts since "Wreck-It Ralph". I dare to say that this movie surpasses my disappointment from "Frozen". This is not an idiotic film, there's plenty of both the entertainment and good moralities that I don't think I've seen from other previous Disney movies. Like (just an example): be careful for someone you don't know or trust yet. See?

And another thing, ignore those who says its a kids flick and that stupid prejudice about "animated films are for kids only". No! Everyone no matter the age should see this. I wasn't angry at all to find out that it won its Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film and I'm happy that finally a movie with such good-spirited presentation got what it deserved.

Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.

However, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.

Sure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox

An amazing Disney movie.Maybe the best one I ever watched. I have to be honest.The best Disney movie since well, maybe 'The iron giant' or perhaps any other great cartoon. Ignore the haters. Believe me, the haters are dumb. Because it's an action packed, funny, and emotional story with a great plot that you will probably enjoy with your family. It may seem cheesy at times. But you may not walk away unsatisfied. Really realistic animation, and amazing voice acting. Is it for only for children? Nope, I don't think so. I watched this with my younger brother, and we both enjoyed it equally. If you love to watch cartoons, and if you enjoy movies with great plots, and if you want to enjoy a hearty laugh ... This is a great bet. Believe me ... This is an amazing movie, that you'll enjoy with your family and friends.

Where do I begin? Big hero Six is one of the best movies I've seen all year. In one of my previous reviews, I used the term over and over again that Disney has always done what it's done and should stick to that. And this movie has! Running Disney themes have this movie that gets me very happy with Disney. This movie as I said in my previous review brings us back from the god awful frozen. Very original and I'll bring this back from any any old tales or fairy tales, big hero six tells the tale of a young man's struggle to find the men who killed his brother.With great action scenes good moral values and enough strength and motivation in its stride it brings me back to good Faith with Disney. Constant Disney clichés that always want to make me watch this movie over and over again , with a side of no backtracking and no unnecessary characters brings us to believe that Disney's got it back again. This movies originality, good writing, and overall good happy feeling, got me believing that Disney can move on from its mistakes. Disney has shown that it can make a good movie again by showing that you don't need a musical and ridiculous characters to get little kids up and happy to buy your merchandise. This movie spoke to a wide variety of people and not just easily fooled little kids. This movie must've been a stowaway on the crap boat that was frozen and maleficent.This movie is a rare occasion of well done combinations of different elements (superheroes, Disney clichés, etc). If you lost your money to frozen watch this movie so you metaphorically won't waste it.

"Big Hero 6" is a movie that shows the best of both Disney and Marvel. It's funny, has exciting action scenes and has enjoyable characters.

Baymax (Scott Adsit), the inflatable huggable healthcare companion for Hiro (Ryan Potter) was, for me, the best part of the movie. Baymax brings laughs in almost every scene he is in, has a lot of action scenes and you end up loving him. Hiro is the most developed of the human characters (he is funny, his actions, however rash and dangerous, are understandable and he grows and learns from his mistakes) and he along with Baymax makes the movie great. Although the other humans are all fun in their own way, I wish we got to know more about them.

The villain in this movie is good as well. Just goes about his job doing evil stuff in an evil manner and is threatening throughout.

My only issue was with the ending which unfortunately went as predicted. However, this was still a very fun movie which did go places (dark intense places) I did not expect and improved the movie for me. Big Hero 6 entertained me a lot and will be fun for the entire family.

Big Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't like others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated feature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.

The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.

Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.

I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!

Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.

Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is to help whomever he can.

On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.

My issues:

1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's identity and motive feel tacked on.

I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this, but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot let it go.

I popped along to the most anticipated movie of my Babes Inflatables. Big Hero 6. The film surrounds an Inflatbles that sets about saving the a town. How it stats that is that a young kid Hiro has an amazing relationship with his Bro Tashadi. Hero starts with Robo Fighting. His bro Tashadi is exceptionally looking out for him. I've never seen such closeness. He brings his Bro Hiro to a Nerd School college kinda. Hiro is overwhelmed. He meets Baymax(INFLATBLES). He's an Inflatable Robot that is a "Healthcare Companion". They go on a journey in finding out the mysterious person who was involved the fire. 

Overall a FANTASTIC film. Pure emotional at times. But fantastic. I smell a sequel on its way.

(Warning there might be some brief spoilers and please READ before rating!)

For a long time IMDb has been my help for not only watching many movies but also helping me to be aware what movie's are great or awful. But now I think I'm almost starting to lose my respect for this site when a movie like Big Hero 6 is being wrongfully bashed for being clichéd or unoriginal and many other things. To be honest everyone, Big Hero 6 is getting too much undeserved hatred. Why are there so many people who are so against this movie in the first place? 

Now don't get me even started with that "it's a kids movie" crap, I'm a 20 year old boy who loves Animated movies as well enjoys live-action movies but I have realized one thing that I think everyone should learn is that: Just because it's an animated flick it doesn't have to be a true kids thing. I don't care if this is a Disney movie, most of them are great and well- crafted but as well there have been some less better movies lately like "Brave" and "Frozen" (please I don't want to offend anyone I just didn't enjoy them very well for various reasons).

What I have also learned is that there are two kinds of experience when people watch movies; one are those who enjoys them through the whole of their length and the second are those who analyzes them. I usually don't analyze movies but lately it has been useful for me to experience them but I do enjoy them as well depending my interests and vision. I know when a movie is good or awful but a movie like Big Hero 6 just doesn't deserve the hatred it is getting and having seen the movie twice I really can't find and see what's to wrong with it.

People were arguing that "Brave" didn't deliver a prominent story being based on its title, and people were arguing to "Frozen" for the bad moralities it delivered (I admit that some of the morals they showed indeed left me questionable). Did I feel the same with BH6? No not at all. I wasn't just looking for a movie with beautiful animation and some nice humor, I looked for and were hoping for a movie with better morals and I can assure that you will get those in this movie.

Stop thinking that this will be a movie that the kids will find it awesome like a "Ben 10" show-off with no story. This neither was a brain-dead movie like a Michael Bay film and neither was it only made for the kiddies, when I was in the theater not only did the children enjoy it but the whole theater with the adults cheered and were happy that it touched them and realizing that the movie worked without being a commercial of something.

The movie worked fine and yet being based on the comic book and it's "obvious" changes it didn't look something that looked "childish" or "unbearable". The main character and it's adventure did remind me why I loved the first Spider-Man movie from 2002. I know that many people said that the movie was too fast or really fast-paced that you don't get to learn it's supporting characters. OK while I can agree that the movie was pretty fast-paced but I got to learn the "supporting characters" without any problems, they're not one-dimensional trust me even though we get to learn more about Fred which in my opinion was a very nice character which indeed left me surprised for who he really was. 

As for the main villain, I didn't mind if it would have been an important or a special character from the movie but I was hoping to know if it were a true villain for a "good" reason. Be honest you don't like it when a certain villain is a villain for no reason. And it's main reason for me looked alright I wasn't unimpressed or flabbergasted at all. Really Yokai was a much better villain than "Hans" from "Frozen".

Anyways I found BH6 to have the things that kept me enjoyed, good morals, characters that learn and evolves from their flaws, a cute robot like Baymax (who wouldn't like to have a robot like him?), nice humor without being too crude or inappropriate, pretty nice soundtrack, a gorgeous unexpected moment and most importantly; Heart and I do mean it this time. I don't care if a 10 sounds ludicrous, I gave it a 10 because I was so pleased that Disney finally could capture their essence not only what they were made for, but a movie that finally delivers more desirable morals than what both "Brave" and "Frozen" didn't deliver.

So really ignore the poor and negative reviews out there, there not making any justice to this movie. This movie is much better than what you might think it is and stop thinking it like it's meant to be for the children's entertainment where no older people than them can enjoy. Give this a chance especially if you're looking for a better animated film than the last 2 Oscar winners we recently had. And if you ever or somebody you know need a movie that delivers the good morals, this movie will always be there for you.

Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie.

This Disney computer animated film was advertised a good few months before the actual release, including cinemas with a large inflatable rubber versions of the recognisable leading robot character, I was very much looking forward to this feature. Basically fourteen year old robotics genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo and spends his time participating in back-alley robot fights, his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) worries he's wasting his potential, so he takes him to the robotics lab at his university, there Hiro meets Tadashi's friends GoGo Tomago (Sucker Punch's Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). Hiro is also introduced to Baymax (Scott Adsit), a personal healthcare robot Tadashi created, amazed, Hiro decides to apply for the school, presenting his project - microbots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable - to gain admission, school robotics program head Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) is impressed and Hiro is accepted, but a fire breaks out at the university, Tadashi rushes to rescue Callaghan, but the building explodes and both are killed, Hiro secludes himself from others having lost his brother. One day, Hiro accidentally activates Baymax who responds to his cry of pain, i.e. "ouch", the robot notices one of Hiro's microbots moving in its jar and thinks it wants to go somewhere, Hiro and Baymax are led to an abandoned warehouse, there they discover that someone has been mass-producing Hiro's bots, before a masked man controlling them attacks and chases them out. Realising this masked man has stolen his project, Hiro decides to catch him, upgrading Baymax with high-tech armour and a battle chip, and he reunites with GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred, the six form a superhero team, they are all attacked by the masked man but manage to get away. The group discovers a former lab of prestigious robotics company Krei Tech, it was experimenting teleportation technology, the test went wrong when the test pilot vanished into the unstable vortex, the masked man reveals himself as Profressor Callaghan, he stole Hiro's bots and used them to escape the fire. So Tadashi died in vain, Hiro angrily removes Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving him only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan, Baymax almost does so, until the healthchip is reinserted by Honey, and he is restored, angry for their interference Hiro leaves his friends and goes home where he breaks down. Baymax asks Hiron if killing Callaghan would improve his "emotional state", he is not sure, but to soften Hiro's loss Baymax plays several humorous video clips of Tadashi creating and running tests on him during Baymax's development, Hiro realises killing Callaghan is not what Tadashi would have wanted, so he makes amends with his friends. The group discovers that Callaghan wants revenge on Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk), president of Krei Tech, because he blames him for the death of his daughter Abigail (Katie Lowes), she was the test pilot, so with newly formed armour and technological advances they team together to save Krei and stop Callaghan. The microbots are destroyed and Krei is saved, but the teleportation portal remains active and is imploding, Baymax detects that Abigail is still alive, trapped in hypersleep, in the abyss, he and Hiro race to save her, but with most of his armour lost Baymax realises the only way to save Hiro and Abigail is to propel them back out the portal with his remaining rocket fist, Hiro refuses to leave him, but Baymax insists and Hiro tearfully gives in, Hiro and Abigail make it back, and Callaghan is arrested. Sometime later Hiro is trying to move on, but he discovers Baymax's clenched rocket fist contains his healthcare chip (this contains his entire personality), delighted he rebuilds Baymax and they happily reunite, and with their four friends they continue helping those in need in the city, as Big Hero 6. Also starring Maya Rudolph as Cass, Abraham Benrubi as General, Billy Bush as Newscaster and Daniel Gerson as Desk Sergeant. The young leading character is a likable and sometimes vulnerable technological genius, his supporting friends all offer their good traits as well, but it is the hero's robot companion that steals the show with his kind and caring personality, and when he gets added extras he becomes much more the fantastic pal to have. This is supposed to be based on a comic book series, it apparently does not have much relation to the original, but that doesn't matter, the whole family will be enthralled by the high-octane fight, flying and chase sequences, as well as the tender moments, the references to western technology and culture is great, and the animation is superb, it is a fabulous animated superhero action comedy film. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!

Big Hero 6 provides what you'd want in a movie as a kid, and maybe as an adult depending on how in touch you are with your inner-kid. Especially if you have a sibling (brother more specifically) the film's core relationship between Hiro and his older brother - it's not something that we see throughout, due to the first major turning point in the film, but the memory certainly remains strong - it will resonate. But the movie is only intermittently interested in pulling at your heartstrings; it's ultimately about suiting up, getting on the gadgets, and putting together a team. So the film is a lot of things in one - not to mention having an instantly adorable (i.e. lucrative) mascot at the center with Baymax.

By saying that it has "what you'd want" in a movie, I don't just mean super-heroes in the Marvel tradition (though it doesn't have the Marvel banner, this is based on a Marvel title, albeit an obscure-ish one), but anime as well. Many of the story turns, including the ones that are rather startling and the tonal shifts from lightness to tragedy and then swiftly back to lightness and action and thrills, it's like what I might expect to see from Japan directly. Which, of course, is part of the source itself, and the fact that the city is called 'San-FrancTokyo' (ho-ho) and the film has primarily Asian characters - whether they're all played by Asians is another story, but I digress.

I can't be too hard on a film that is just out to sheerlessly entertain the audience like this. It does have some points on the nature of grief and what happens when people are faced with losing someone who can't come back (... or can they?) I think it could've been even better, possibly great, if it had a bit of a better balance on the dark and the light sides of the film. Ultimately, I felt, the tragic parts came when they had to, and outside of that Big Hero 6 is essentially a Fun Ride Of A Movie (in caps), primarily led by a Doctor-cum-Fighting robot in Baymax, and some other supporting characters who are fine, no more no less. Just fine.

But maybe Baymax is enough, and certainly, more often than not, this is a very funny movie. He has the entertainment value of the Genie in Aladdin - like in that film, he's the friendly BIG companion who can help save the day for the protagonist - except instead of the thousands of impressions of Williams, it's the exact opposite that makes him appealing: one personality, pretty straightforward, and the dead-pan nature is closer to, oh I don't know, Jeff Bridges in Starman. He's the perfect innocuous character, but is hilarious for the reasons of reaction and straight silliness.

It should also be noted the last act, the climax, has its predictable points - like most (or almost all) superhero movies, i.e. from Marvel, it has to all build up to a gigantic Must-Save-the-City from impending gargantuan destruction, involving space as well. And a turn from a character kind of comes out of nowhere, which is fine except that the development is kind of off to suddenly be the "villain". However, again, akin to anime, so I can let it slide and still be sucked into the peril of the thing (I mean, hey, they can't all be The Incredibles).

For what it's worth though, there's so much to enjoy with this film that I'm sure if I was younger I'd eat it up with a spoon and want seconds-thirds-fourths-etc. It's an insatiably pleasant film to experience, faults and all. 7.5/10

My family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The atmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the plot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me. If you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've found your holy grail.

Big Hero 6 is now literally my new favorite of all time! It is the most awesome movie in the entire world. I can't wait for the sequel, if there is not a sequel I will die (not literally, just an expression). My favorite part is the immortals scene where they all get suited up into super heroes. I'm not going to say any spoilers, because some people haven't seen it yet, like some of the girls at my school. My favorite character is Hiro, its not just because he is smart and nerdy, but the guy who plays him (Ryan Potter) is really cute. If there is a next movie I think that, Hiro should fall in love and somebody kidnaps Baymax to make it more interesting. Big Hero 6 is amazing and I can't wait for the sequel.

This is a feature based on a Marvel comic book and produced by Walt Disney Animation. There will be spoilers ahead:

The descriptives for this film are legion. It's exciting, funny, poignant, sweet, charming, breathtaking and delightful. I had some doubts when I first heard about this movie. I thought it looked iffy. I was happily wrong.

There are two brothers, living with their aunt, both technical wizards, the younger one (named Hiro) a 13 year old, super smart but at loose ends taking part in robot fights and getting in some tight spots. His brother Tadashi, wanting his brother to have some direction, tricks him by taking him to his school and getting him interested in getting into the same place.

This introduces most of the other characters into the film, including Tadashi's friends, all of them technical wizards as well-Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred-as well as a tech legend, Robert Callaghan and the most important and enjoyable character in the film, Baymax, who is Tadashi's big project, a medical diagnostic tool which is very empathic, capable and childlike.

Hiro has to enter a competition to get in and comes up with a micro-bot which has enormous flexibility and range. It's an incredibly impressive thing, attracting both the attention of an industrialist named Krei and an acceptance letter from Callaghan. Hiro takes the letter and rejects the financial arrangement from Krei.

Tragedy strikes and throws Hiro into a tailspin until two things happen: he re-encounters Baymax and finds out someone is using his micro-bot technology, which he thought was destroyed. This is where the film starts taking off. Hiro puts some additional coding on another chip into Baymax, adding more skills and making him more than just a medical diagnostic machine. The four introduced earlier form a superhero team with Hiro and Baymax, which ties back into the title.

The film is at times reminiscent of the film The Avengers, which isn't surprising, given the source material for the film. The visuals here are great, particularly the look of San Fransokyo, the city this is set in. It's breathtaking.

I really don't want to go into much more on the last part of the film, so I just have two observations left. One, I fully expect there will be at least one sequel coming in the next few years and, two, when you watch this, watch all the way to the end of the film, end credits and all. It's most definitely worth the time. The art under the credits is excellent and there's something nice at the end.

This film is out on Blu Ray and DVD and is well worth watching on Blu Ray if you have that capability. Most highly recommended.
