### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
There is something to be said of a person who does not know when to stop and listen a message that has left them in the past. I watched this film and cried because I have spent my adult life keeping myself and my children out of the "system". I have spent teaching my children that they are more than what white society is trying to pin on them. To read a review that basically regurgitates all of the right leaning rhetoric that, if they watched the film, started at the very beginning of slavery. The US was/is built on the backs of other races that the US has no intention acknowledge. The history that is taught in the US not only white washes (pun intended) but also teaches to have pride in a misrepresented history. To find out what contributions brown and black people made to this country is an elective in college that most white Americans will never even glance at. So to say that this film is one sided...yes it is but white America has had it one sided for over 400 years with all the strength, weight, industrial, and political power at its disposal. SO, go a look at the history from a perspective other than Rush Limbaugh and the like. You just might finally understand that brown and black lives are not a tool for whites to use at a whim but humans that have the RIGHT to be treated the same......

This documentary shines a very bright light on two fundamental issues going on in our country. The power of money and it's influence on profitable incarceration and ultimately perpetual slavery. I think it did a fabulous job of being virtually opinion free and making a point to stay focused on facts. That said, I think you have to be open to the information. By that, whether you lean right or left, it's best to digest this documentary with an open mind free of your own political thoughts and opinions. 

It's foundation is about slavery and how it plays a role in modern events. It suggests that slavery never went away, it merely reinvented itself to "keep up with the times", always having financial gain being the catalyst for it's continued existence. It really shines when it presents it's case on how mass incarceration is today's slavery. The direct correlation between labor based slavery of yesteryear and labor based incarceration of today is frightening in regards to similarity. You can deny it if you choose to, but if you continue to do so after seeing this presentation, then it's simply because you deny fact. 

When Colin Kaepernick protested the flag, though I'm a black man, I was offended by his stance. After watching this documentary however, I look at his point of view with a different lens. I don't entirely agree with his approach, but I have to admit that oppression in this country is still very alive and well. I think too many people look at oppression in traditional views like slavery and the holocaust. But in my opinion, you have to appreciate oppression as the complexity that it is, in order to acknowledge it's existence. Again this documentary does an excellent job of making that case. I won't delve too deep into why, I would just simply recommend watching it.

Word of caution however. This documentary doesn't pull it's punches. It's very dark, very disconcerting regarding politics and if it hits you right, it will make you angry and sad all at once. My two children stayed in the forefront of my mind while watching this, and my heart bled for them throughout, seeing what kind of world that awaits them. I tried to be optimistic about light being brought to this issue in such a well put together way, but I believe that we as a country, still have a ways to go, seeing that someone like Trump could get so close to being President. 

Overall, this documentary is very important and should be seen by everyone able. Whether you lean right or left, you cannot deny some of the dirty deals made by politicians to keep their pockets lined via profitable incarceration. Real change needs to happen without question, but this documentary drives home the point that as long as "the almighty dollar" rules, don't expect much change anytime soon.

It's not enough to look at one thing to analyze what is wrong with it, is a key point that may get overlooked (or simply not exactly the focus, but between the lines) in Ava DuVernay's powerful indictment of an entire society. When you look at the systemic issues of racism in this country, slavery is the key thing, and the title refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution (need a cinematic reference point, see Spielberg's Lincoln for more), and how one small line in the amendment referring to how slavery is outlawed except, kinda, sorta, for criminals, is paramount in how black people and bodies have been treated in the 150 years since the end of the Civil War.

Because at extremely crucial times in history, like right after the signing of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, black people were not in positions of power or government or, of course, in business (as this doc goes very in depth on), figures who spouted 'Law and Order' and "War on Drugs" made life not a matter of inconvenience or difficult for blacks, it was more like a refitting or metamorphosis of the sort of principle that went into slavery - keep everyone repressed and afraid, and if they get out of line they have to work and work for no wages and have little rights - into the modern age. Anyone can look up the statistics about how high the prison incarceration rates have gone up over the past 45 years (this despite the fact that, at least since the 1990's, crime rates have gone down generally speaking nationwide), and particularly for African Americans the struggle is that, well, 1 out of 3 black men will go to prison in their lifetimes (vs how much smaller that ratio is for whites).

DuVernay's film is a mix of a variety of talking heads, muckraking information that might be out of a Michael Moore film about things like the ALEC company and the like who formulate actual legislation that is pro-for-profit prisons, and footage from the likes of Nixon and Reagan's most damning points looking "Presidential" while distorting the truth (and the even more damning points from their advisers caught on tape how they actually were going about specifically going after minorities as "threats" to the system). Constantly here, the thing is, nothing is in a vacuum. What we see from The Birth of a Nation by Griffith (incidentally I saw this doc mere hours after seeing Parker's new film, so this almost picks up where he left off), was that there actually was a film that one can say really did inspire people to commit acts of violence: hyping up the KKK to become a dominant force after years of being dormant and unpopular, by painting blacks as the "savages" that will come and rape and pillage your precious whites.

So much in that film may seem awful and hateful now, but also these sorts of images continue to be perpetuated, is what DuVernay is saying, and things are interconnected all the time; what happened with the Central Park Five in 1989; Willie Horton; Bill Clinton's crime bill; Mandatory Mininums; Trayvon Martin and Ferguson; all of these companies making bills for politicians that they can literally *fill in the blank* with their state name, which calls to question what a country is if corporations are writing bills. There's so much to unpack in the film, but as a director DuVernay keeps things moving at a pace that is electrifying but also never hard to take in. I'd want to watch this again more-so to admire the touches of filmmaking, all of the text pieces she puts up to accompany song transitions (Public Enemy for one), than even to take in pieces of information she puts out.

Also fascinating is how she puts the variety of talking heads here: we get people like Charlie Rangel (who was once very tough on crime and regrets it today) and mayor David Dinkins and Cory Booker and Angela Davis, but we also get to see Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist and a sort of spokesman for one of these ALEC type of companies (I forget his name). Having them juxtaposed with figures who have seen how awful this country has treated people of color in the justice system with drug laws that are meant to make criminal (that's a word that comes back again and again) makes for a viewing experience that can be startling but it keeps you on your toes. Will they possibly say something reasonable or reprehensible? Some watching it may not even know who Norquist is - I should think DuVernay made this film to last, not just for the 2016 year, albeit clips from Clinton and Trump, the latter some of the explosive racist moments at his campaign stops in the crowds, make it timely - but it shouldn't matter too much.

13th gives you a massive amount of facts and statistics, but it's never a lecture, and if it's a plea it's that people should realize real reforms don't or really can't happen overnight. Minds and attitudes need to change on a more fundamental level, where *centuries* of oppression have kept metastasizing like a cancer. And at the center of it is DuVernay creating a conversation and narrative that inspires a great many emotions, mostly sadness and anger, but is just as palpable as in her film Selma. A must-see.

It appears that all reviews of this documentary are in turn reviewed by where people stand politically. I'll side-step that by analyzing this as a film lover who is multi-ethnic and has studied criminology and has worked for many years in the behavioral health system, including rehabilitation and diversion of people entering the judicial system, of all races and social classes. And so it goes...

"13th" or "The 13th" does well in cinematic sense with an interesting photography of the subjects it interviews, and very effective editing. Its juxtapositions of past and present work well for film purposes, although some may object to the sociopolitical comparisons. What was ineffective and annoying was the use of sudden words quite often going into the screen, including the occasional song lyric, not all of which felt like it matched. It often felt like it was there to pad time, which is odd given the wide range of subjects that were interviewed who likely had more to say. That stole from the experience for me, akin to complaints that I've read others make of other documentaries that have done this, e.g. "Nico Icon". As a whole, the narrative starts off potent but loses some traction about 2/3rds through, similar to how I felt about DuVernay's "Selma".

From the criminal justice and political aspect, "13th" does best when it sticks to its thesis: that politicians created a system of mass incarceration for dubious reasons, which are rooted in racism and intentional disenfranchisement, and which is possibly influenced by businesses that make a profit from running prisons and using prisoners as a cheap or free workforce. Yes, it is a long run-on sentence, but that's the thesis. It supports itself well when analyzing politics, and the intentional and unintentional consequences. It alternates between stating one side of a debate as fact (e.g. whether Woodrow Wilson endorsed "Birth of a Nation") and having people who represent both sides of the debate. Regardless, it achieves its effect of a plausible theory, while eliciting horror, anger, and disgust. It is less well supported when exploring the link of current companies that stand to gain from imprisonment. They clearly document that they lobby to expand their business opportunities, including some highly questionable attempts and an inappropriate role in writing laws, but it's less clear that they are a driving force behind the incarcerations. It doesn't help when they use some gross generalizations, e.g. that Aramark sells rotten food. I've seen Aramark serve their generic, fattening cafeteria food to dozens of institutions, and it is never rotten, as in those two awful instances. However, DuVernay does raise an effective alert of a potential threat, that at the very least leaves us questioning the role of commercialization/privatization of the criminal justice system.

She is less successful when she goes off course into tying in Black Lives Matter; it didn't really fit the main narrative, but more of a sub-narrative of law and order being altered by racism. This deserves a larger, longer, more careful focus, as it brings in much debated situations that are too recent, some brought in too briefly. "OJ: Made in America" addresses this sub-topic better, using a greater length.

But as much as DuVernay puts into the film to explore how incarcerations increased, she misses many factors. Racism, explosion in population in the post-war era, political machinations, and introduction of drugs and drug laws are all mentioned. She somehow leaves out the increase in availability in firearms, the development of gangs (ironic, as the Bloods and the Mara Salvatrucha started in US prisons), and a sharp increase in a pro-crime, narcissistic sub-cultures. This is not limited to one racial/ethnic group or socioeconomic group, nor is it recent. But 90s-on gangsta culture has driven in hard a message that life is short; you need to blow massive amounts of money in narcissistic displays of it; that decent jobs will not get you there, that stealing, dealing, grifting and boosting are the only ways; that going to prison is good and inevitable; and that the slightest challenge to your being the center of the universe should be responded to with violence. This culture, when it is bought into by anyone of any group, is the hardest thing to deal with when trying to rehabilitate someone, second only to an abusive family. And I've seen it with white kids from wealthy families, 2nd generation Latinos with hardworking parents with different values and culture, African-American kids with extremely hardworking parents who reject this message, and adults who should know much better. And it is now being exported overseas, with the same result of increased incarceration and police violence. Why skip this? Why not question it as well? DuVernay's thesis suggests that almost everyone in the criminal justice system are only there because of petty drug charges, but she fails to test the null hypothesis. While this is true of a segment of prisoners, it does not apply to all. I bring it up because more than half of felons and people otherwise with repeat criminal justice involvement that I have encountered (of all races) have charges for multiple crimes; it is not just simple possession, or dealing small amounts of lesser drugs, but additional crimes such as those around theft, sudden acts of aggression, forgery, or driving while intoxicated. Are African Americans more exposed to drug crime in general, due to the same factors she lists? And what are the alternatives to incarceration? DuVernay also regrettably skips probing rehabilitation and probation, other than to briefly question the latter as over-done and possibly driven by profit.

In sum, good for discussion of political issues, but not comprehensive in criminology issues.

The documentary is an excellent summary of American History. To a larger degree it is important to address some of the comments made. I find several people's comments such as, "don't do the crime, if you can't do the time" indicative of the very systemic racism that was the impetus for the need of such a piece. The comments are very telling and actually say more about the people writing them than do their intentions to demean the documentary by leaving negative reviews. 

The fact that people can disregard this for the myriad of completely shallow reasons such as, "I stopped watching when I realized it was against Trump and for Hillary" is laughable. The reality is that you don't want to accept America's REAL history. The documentary was well over an hour and the section about the presidential race was a minute fraction of that. 

Again, shallow reasons such as this speak volumes about the people leaving them. America's history is what it is. None of us are proud of these particular aspects or at least you shouldn't be but in an effort to get better we must first accept the truth. This is the truth. Acceptance is the first step towards getting better. It is so not about Trump or Hillary. I almost don't think you actually watched because no reasonably intelligent person would dismiss the piece as you guys did for the reasons you chose.

Preface: Looking at the other negative reviews and their corresponding extremely low useful/not useful ratio I am pretty sure this will also be down-voted into oblivion if not outright denied for publication. However, I feel it is now more important than ever to resist this increasingly tyrannical trend of shouting down every non political correct opinion so I will still try to post this as neutral and comprehensive as I can.

Let me start off with the fact that as a fervent anti-SJW (Social Justice Warrior) I started this movie with extreme reservations. As a libertarian I strongly believe in the power of responsibility and the "live and let live" rhetoric which seems to be ever more misrepresented in this liberal society. My hopes shot up though when I saw both republican (Nixon and Reagan) and democrat (both the Clintons) presidents being scrutinized for their bills and their corresponding negative consequences not just for black folk, but ultimately everyone in America. Granted, Obama was not scrutinized at all (the presidency with the most racial hate crimes in decades!) and we can see both the Clinton's apologizing later on, but the proposed narrative of "equal blame" proved hopeful indeed.

As the movie progressed I did get a better sense of the legitimate grievances of the African American community which did take me by surprise. Although I was already quite knowledgeable about the prison industrial complex I still learned quite a bit. Of course the KKK was put up as a powerful and bloodthirsty group of racist white people while their counterpart, the Black Panther/BLM, were put up as a peaceful yet righteous protesting group. However, you can not be racist to white people so I digress. So far, despite some other obvious race-baiting propaganda like the Zimmerman case, a solid 7/10.

Enter the last 30 minutes of the movie. Like a volcano which has been building pressure slowly but surely, finally the mess explodes into one big biased eruption. We now see several cherry picked parts of one Trump convention were he gets rudely interrupted by BLM "protesters" several times. When the protester didn't cease these extremely rude interruptions the crowd becomes uneasy and Trump replies with some bullish statements such as "in my time they would exit this place on a stretcher".

This is where it gets really crazy. The previously mentioned statement along with a few milder ones are dubbed over quite dramatic black and white scenes of black men being abused and beaten in the streets during the civil rights movement. So we see Trump supporters pushing out the BLM "protestor" rotated with the pictures of black men being beaten in the street for the crime of wanting equal rights. The power of this subtle way of editing is something we haven't seen in a long time ("Der Ewige Jude" comes to mind) and can only truly be conveyed by watching the actual movie. The point is clear, A vote for Trump = A vote for Jim Crow. Whether or not this was intentional, I am still not certain, but unfortunately this does nothing to save the movie. 

The irony in this is that about 90% of the time it is Anti-Trump protesters (BLM) attacking Trump supporters, their properties or conventions and not the other way around. YouTube is absolutely littered with clips of people getting hunted down for wearing a M.A.G.A cap or Trump signs getting stolen from backyards or even urinated on. And that is the problem with propaganda, often it is complete nonsense mixed with a shred of truth and a whole dash of emotional appeal.

In summary, the movie describes the great effort of the media and state to try and demonize black people while ironically doing exactly the same with white people. This glaring hypocrisy made it completely lose its credibility and will undoubtedly only strengthen the bigotry of millions of people and, not unlike Obama's reign, will further increase polarization in the US. If we ever want true racial harmony we will need to come clean with everything, be honest about past, present and future and certainly not make cheap shots such as depicted in the "13th".

The movie is well done but borders on propaganda in my mind. We all know history but few tend to delve into present reality.

This link breaks things down in no uncertain terms.

."in regard to nonviolent crimes, such as DWI/alcohol offenses, blacks and whites both commit crimes nearly identical to their representative population. However, in violent/aggressive crimes, blacks commit them at a rate many times higher than their representative population, while whites tend to commit them at a rate markedly lower than their representative population."

Because it is almost impossible to separate the message from the filmmaking, 13TH is difficult to review solely as a film. It is important to note that this is a documentary, not journalism. 13TH is a propaganda piece advancing a clear point of view while omitting information that does not support its premise. Michael Moore and Dinesh D'Souza have made documentaries that also lack the objectivity of journalism.

Some of Moore's documentaries manage to be entertaining while also advancing Moore's beliefs. 13TH is too strident to be entertaining. That lack of entertainment makes the film difficult to separate from its message. The cinematography is competent but unremarkable. The editing reinforces the message but nothing more. Without its message, 13TH is a slightly below-average film.

Easily 75% of the film presents truths that are tough to refute or argue. However, those accustomed to the objectivity desired in journalism ought to take issue with 13TH when it does omit contradicting information.

Perhaps most glaringly, 13TH ignores homicide statistics. While incarceration rates in the U.S. soared, the homicide rate plummeted. The nation needs to find ways to achieve the lower homicide rate without incarcerating so many people. Police tactics like stop and frisk likely saved lives, but those same tactics also have ensnared too many innocent people.

13TH suggests that secret racism is behind the incarceration rate and aggressive police tactics. By ignoring the declining homicide rates, the film ignores that some of the public support for mandatory sentencing and tough policing is motivated by a desire for fewer racial minorities to be killed.

A good portion of 13TH focuses on the suggestion that the prison system has become privatized and mass incarcerations have occurred for financial gain. While all of these arguments hold water, the film obviously ignores Al Sharpton becoming a multi-millionaire through his racial activism. The prison-industrial complex is not the only source of lobbying funds in Washington. Millions of dollars flow in and out of Washington in support of racial equality. Some filmmakers might even make money and win awards off of their civil rights activism.

13TH suggests that through a clause in the 13th Amendment, slavery essentially continues unabated in the U.S. Eight years before the release of this film, this nation elected its first black president. The filmmaker does not appear ever to have been incarcerated. Some of the talking heads in the film like Cory Booker have not been incarcerated. The nation has moved forward considerably, but 13TH is correct in its depictions of the challenges still faced by some racial minorities.

These issues are far more complex than the simple message of 13TH. It is unfortunate that the film neither attempts to present a call to action, nor does it convey the complexities that make solutions difficult to find. Ultimately, 13TH will make plenty of money off of those who already share its point of view.

A more powerful film might affect societal change. Financial success and accolades will be the main accomplishments of 13TH.

The documentary is an excellent summary of American History. This doc should required viewing in school. You cannot deny the facts and of one chooses to do so, then You have to be profiting from this current system to criminalize fir financial gain. The fact that people can disregard this for the myriad of completely shallow reasons such as, "I stopped watching when I realized it was against Trump and for Hillary" is laughable. The reality is that you don't want to accept America's REAL history. Denial is no longer an option. I know many American families are currently benefiting From the prison industrial complex, whether shareholders in the private prisons or contracts provided for the necessities required in prisons. No longer can black bodies fund the wealth on America. Following the timeline after slavery was abolished in 1865 the landscape was set in motion for the current climate. Americans stop living in you're bubble, sacrifice is required from us all to stop this. The system is so ingrained within the stability of the middle class family so there will be denial in rhetorical speech that this is no so bad, blacks are criminals and need tobe incarcerated but this is image of us is not new. History speaks the truth about America's original sin with slavery.

On the synopsis it mentions "An in-depth look at the prison system in the United States" ,i was quite excited, finally an interesting movie with a good subject , but what i watched was the American history of the blacks being slaves and... black people commit crime but it's the white peoples fault. Nothing ,but nothing about the prison system in the United States.

Extremely disappointed... in the end it was just a Total liberal propaganda.

I want to be clear that I am not reviewing the message presented by this film, a flaw in documentary reviewing that I find very common, even (especially?) among professional movie critics.

Instead, I want to address how this film works as a film in delivering its message.

13th is clearly intended to shock its audience. Its message is a wholly unpleasant reality to deal with - the idea that institutional racism is arguably as prevalent in the US today as it has ever been and that it serves the wealthy in maintaining their power and wealth. I consider myself to be relatively well-informed about the privatisation of the jail system in the US and other matters that the film highlights, such as police brutality and attempts to disenfranchise black Americans in many states. However, I did find 13th shocking still, and felt at the end of it that I had learned more than I perhaps even wanted to know. The film commanded my attention and, largely, stayed on topic and linked its points together credibly.

Having said this, I did find that the pace of information delivered and the rapid editing was simply overwhelming at times. More than once, I had to wind back and listen to a point again, simply because my brain was still trying to register what was pouring into it. This made the film feel like a deliberate assault on the senses.

A good illustration of this is the multitude of talking heads that are brought into the movie one after the other, all facing different directions, though they're the only thing on screen at the time, with barely a pause for breath between each point. The effect was as if there were 15 people in a room all talking over each other, but the camera is only ever on one of them at a time. Clearly these are all individual interviews, filmed separately, so why does director Ava DuVernay feel the need to present them all in such a haphazard manner? It felt to me that the only reason for this is to make the viewer disoriented as all of this information comes rushing at them. In short, to make them less able to critically analyse what is being said. It feels like the technique used by someone who isn't telling the truth. Now I am not arguing that this is the case here - I don't think that it is - so why make the style like this? I think that the message of this movie is shocking enough without the need to pummel the audience into submission with the way it is edited and I think that it's a shame that this was the choice made. With some audiences I imagine it will backfire and they will feel alienated by a message they may otherwise have accepted.

Overall, I definitely applaud this film for its ability to enlighten audiences about an important issue, but I fault it for choosing to do so in such an overwhelming manner, which makes real-time critical assessment of its message difficult.

I'm still asking myself, no one, at any point in this documentary asks the question WHY black people are put in jail, legislation that is the same for any color and gender.

I recognize the history of the US and it's despicable. This kind of warps it into, yes, black people commit crime but it's the white peoples fault.

I'm so sick and tired of the whole focus on race and the color of one's skin, it's how you behave and what you do that should matter.

This could have been interesting, except it just went from informative to pure propaganda.

First of all, there is plenty wrong with our prison system and word needs to get out about it. A portion of 13th discusses the privatized prison business; it's a huge problem. The portion on ALEC is informative and important for all Americans to know. There are significant injustices on young, black men: the story of Kalief Browder is heartbreaking and maddening. However, 13th fails in what I see as the biggest problem with most "documentaries" these days (aside from the fact that they don't actually qualify as documentaries by definition, see below): when they present numbers that are inaccurate, I become skeptical of ALL information they present. If you can't tell the truth on items which can be fact-checked, why should I trust your opinions? 

A lot of what is presented in 13th is done so through the lens of the storyteller, which is understandable, but numbers are cold, hard facts and when one gets those wrong, every point presented around it is discredited. It would take too long to fact check the whole movie so I'll focus on the most glaring inaccuracies: prison population. 

Throughout the documentary, the storyteller shows the rise in prison population over the last several decades and at 50:37, the U.S. prison population in 2014 is listed at 2,306,200. That was a staggering number for me so I immediately searched for statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics shows a total prison population (state and federal) of 1,562,319 for 2014. If you want to claim the DOJ pads their numbers to make them look better than they really are, I'll allow a margin of error. However, margins of error rarely creep above 5% and in this case, the margin of error would have to be 47.6% percent for that to be true. FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT! In my mind, that's when the documentarian went from "documentarian" to "storyteller". She also showed the rise in prison population from decade to decade but failed to mention that the prison population has been consistently trending down year by year since 2009. Granted, the number is small percentage points but it's truth, nonetheless, and doesn't fit her viewpoint.

The storyteller also lends a significant portion of the documentary to (emphatically) suggest that the war on drugs was designed to put black men behind bars and further suggests that it wildly succeeded. While I won't attempt to prove or disprove the intent of the war on drugs because I can't do so with fact (and neither can she, by the way), I can discredit her assertion of success. Again on the BJS report for prison population in 2014, 14.9% were locked up on drug-related charges (3.5% of those were possession, the other 11.4% were trafficking and other offenses). The largest population of black men in prison, 57.8%, were convicted of violent offenses (murder, manslaughter, rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated/simple assault). If the war on drugs (which was only a ploy to lock up non-white males, as asserted by the storyteller) is what caused such a jump in prison population, why are just under 15% of the total black prison population behind bars for drugs? And only 3.5% behind bars for drug possession?

In addition, the statistics on total black male U.S. population and black male prison population are wildly inaccurate.

Let me remind you of the descriptions of 13th on IMDb and Netflix:

"In this thought-provoking documentary, scholars, activists, and politicians analyze the criminalization of African Americans and the U.S. prison boom."

"An in-depth look at the prison system in the United States and how it reveals the nations history of racial inequality."

Not only does this in-depth "documentary" about inequality in the prison system fail to even mention the reason most black men are incarcerated, it outright tells you the reason is war on drugs. I'm left incredibly frustrated because 13th squanders its opportunity to inform people about what's wrong in our judicial system by largely falsifying information. In addition, the way it's edited at the end perpetuates hate, fear, and separation, which does nothing to promote change but further creates divide. 

Finally, I'll leave you with the definitions of "documentary" and "propaganda".

The support this documentary has for both Assata Shakur who killed New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Angela Davis who bought the gun that was used to kill Judge Haley is beyond sick, the movie never tells you what they did and makes they both out to be victims which is lies.

The movie does have some good point when it comes to the laws that both Reagan and Clinton passed, which give so many unnecessary jail time to drug changers , however still finds ways to lie even more,in one case they talked about how historically white men where the ones raping black women, which was true but they bring this up to avoid talking about in the modern times black men are overwhelming raping white women.

The movie even lies about small things such that The Birth of a Nation started the burning cross with the KKK, which is very easy to fact check and make no reason why the film makers would keep such a lie in the movie.

I wanted to like this movie,and hope someone else gives this subject another go without being dishonest or giving a platform to evil human beings such as Angela Davis.

This smorgasbord of historically illiterate oversimplification and race baiting is a disgusting insult to the term "documentary". The implicit message from the get-go is "nothing has changed" for black Americans, never once stopping to consider the colossal ignorance that accompanies such an assertion. DuVernay parades a group of upper crust quisling elites such as Van Jones and Corey Booker as stand ins for the rest of black America, and these dutifully pontificate about this, that, and t'other whilst pretending to gaze thoughtfully off screen. She goes on to grotesquely and insultingly compare the tragic murder of Emmett Till and the suffering of other actual dignified victims of racial violence in the march to freedom to the justified deaths of law breakers Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. This lugubrious, obtuse, and shallow film is further littered with the obscene modern progressive jargon of perpetual victimhood and does nothing to honestly assess and critique the abundant social pathologies that afflict the black community or its sources. No, she merely uses the platform she has to rail idiotically about the "evil" of the white man and ensconces herself as a racial grievance pornographer on par with the execrable Spike Lee. The utter moral bankruptcy of this visual polemic brings to mind the words of Booker T. Washington, from his book "My Larger Education" (published in 1911), in which he writes presciently, "There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs  partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs." One would be hard pressed to find a more fitting description of DuVernay and her shameless, loathsome work.

Fair warning: I am aware my review will be downvoted into oblivion like everyone else who recognized the film is a propaganda piece. If you're willing to recognize an alternate (but factual) viewpoint, carry on.

This film had potential to be great, if it wasn't biased. For example, around 46 minutes, Assata Shakur is brought up, being called a revolutionary hero. However, the film intentionally left out why she was serving a lifetime prison sentence, so I looked it up. She was a gang member and a cop killer, and the entire Black Lives Matter movement (literally a terrorist group by definition) is based on her. In fact, her alternate name is being used in the film so you don't immediately recognize this (if you previously knew about her).

But if this was included in the film, the argument would've fallen apart immediately. The film tried to use her as an example of the FBI going after a powerful black figurehead, such as with MLK. You cannot compare those two individuals simply because they're both black and both were wanted by the FBI. They were completely different people.

Beyond that example, which is just one of many instances of the purposeful omission of key information, the film simply grabs at straws. The concept is based on the oppression and "slavery" of African Americans beyond the Civil Right Movement. Yes, obviously this did happen, and the film did present some significant examples, such as presidents and elite politicians subtly having racist motives.

Where this film fails is by not addressing significant philosophical and sociological questions. It does not discuss how, because African Americans were oppressed and many lived in cities, they could not find work or they lived in poverty. And what happens when you live in poverty, regardless of race or ethnicity? You're more inclined to turn to drugs and crime. So there's a reason to be arrested. In fact, while the film tries to say black people were specifically hurt by certain laws, those laws hurt everyone, regardless of race or ethnicity.

The film doesn't discuss how the black race is, unfortunately, largely represented by an urban subculture which glorifies crime and violence as a progressive result of poverty. The film would've been better if it introduced this, because then the interesting argument of a cycle is created:

Black oppression > stereotypes > poverty > excessive drugs, violence, and crime > tougher laws > longer prison sentences > further emphasis on stereotypes and racism

The film completely blows over this, and instead basically says, "Black people did nothing wrong! It's all the white man's fault, trying to make us slaves again!" In the last three decades, there have been many, many important African American members of society who made something of themselves, fought their way out of economic hardship, and so on. How about Jimi Hendrix, Neil Tyson, Oprah, Michael Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, the former president, etc. What do they have in common? They weren't involved in that glorified subculture. 

In addition, the film is intended to be a combination of both black oppression and the insane incarceration rate in the USA, but it would've been better off not trying to say, "It's the white man's fault!" Discussing the prison-for-profit system and unfair poverty in the USA we have without incorporating a falsified perspective of racism would've been better.

What you'll get here is a ridiculous argument about how the modern-day prison system is exactly like the post-slavery prison system, in which slaves were arrested for petty crimes to work for free again and rebuild the economy. The modern era is nothing like that, and does not unfairly affect blacks. It affects criminals.

I am a member of the target demographic who would be predicted to be sympathetic and supportive of this film. I really was looking forward to this film and upon seeing it pop on netflix immediately sat down to watch it. The film does a great job of laying out the political landscape that led to where we are on this issue and all the stripes of the political players who made this reality we find ourselves in today. It also does a great job regarding the cultural landscape and historical context that led us to where we are on this issue. The history of slavery, racism, KKK and civil rights movement is covered very well and captured powerfully in images that are difficult to look at. But there are some serious omissions that should have been addressed and its not a oversite that can easily be dismissed. Specifically, 1) If you are going to bring the drug war into this discussion, you should include an examination as to why poor neighborhoods and regions are saturated with these substances. If you don't, you allow the naysayers to run to easy cover under the shelter of "law and order" which only takes a few breathes before one starts blaming the imprisoned for getting caught up in the systematic net that was set up and created by design. 2) If you are going to compare statistics or numbers, you need to make damn sure you are comparing apples to apples and not using them willy nilly. If you don't, you look like at worst a propagandist and at best, just plain stupid. This issue is pivotal to the culture we find ourselves in as Americans today. There is no room for slapdash half measures to raise public awareness that we are slowly but surely moving towards a military state. A process during which the populace is taking it all in stride, swallowing the trigger language whole and behaving like frogs in a pot of water being slowly heated on the stove. The filmmakers could have done better and should have done better as it would not required much effort or much more research. They did not serve the issue well with this film and that is frankly tragic.

Be patient with "13th," Ava DuVernay's documentary about how the American prison system has become a modern-day fill-in for slavery. For a long time, the film is a mess, scattered and unfocused. But gradually the various threads come together in support of her central thesis, and what emerges is an accusation aimed at the American white establishment and American big business that benefits financially from keeping the rest of America convinced that black men are criminals and deserve to be incarcerated.

Whether or not you find DuVernay's arguments convincing depend I guess on how well you think she makes them. I liked "13th" while I was watching it, but I'm writing this comment while in the middle of watching "O.J.: Made in America," a film that tackles many of the same themes but handles them all much better, and I have to admit that I can barely remember DuVernay's film now thinking back on it.

13th (2016) 

*** (out of 4)

Extremely well-made, if one-sided, documentary that takes a look at the 13th Amendment and the mass incarceration that many claims is haunting this country. The documentary takes a look at the prison system in America and we see how the populations in prison have gone up through each of the last five decades. We see the political punches that were thrown by Reagan, Bush and Clinton and how people hope things can be changed.

In today's day and age it's hard to find a documentary that is fair or balanced because filmmakers have a cause when they make movies and they want to throw all of their opinions and facts into what they're trying to push. 13 is an extremely well-made movie and for the first hour it's an extremely balanced movie. With that said, the final half hour goes completely off the mark but we'll get to that in a bit.

As far as the film goes, it does a terrific job at showing the prison system and how so many more people are now behind bars. The documentary did a great job at going decade to decade showing the various laws that opened the prison doors including the "Three Strikes and You're Out" policy and why many people are serving life sentences for minor crimes. All of this is brilliantly told and the way the evidence is laid out was wonderfully done.

With that said, the final portion of the film turns into a more Liberal documentary where the likes of Michael Brown and others are brought up. We're told about how awful this country is and how people of color are being terrorized. Well, we know Michael Brown never had his hands up. Yet that is never mentioned here. We're constantly told about how crime rates are falling yet this documentary never talks about the locations where crimes rates are going sky high. There's no mention of Chicago. The film also fails to really make a point that if you didn't commit a crime to begin with then you won't have to worry about the system. It seems this documentary wants to take away any punishment for those who commit crimes.

The number 13 again used and identified as a bad number. But apart from the number connected to a law that was supposed to do a lot of good and instead only shifted things. So while there technically aren't any slaves in America (not talking about illegal working, human trafficking or anything else against the law), this law makes it possible to have some within the context of the law.

Now while you may think criminals are bad people and I should not care about them, I'd advice you to watch this movie and maybe you reconsider what you think. It's not an easy movie to watch and it does put its finger into a wound that has not healed. And even without watching the interview the director gave to Oprah (late 2016 it was, because Trump already was elected, who's also prominent in this documentary), you can tell it was thoroughly investigated and there was a lot of time spent into the making of it, the "sets"/interview locations, the editing and the Questions. A really powerful film that is worth watching, if you can bear it

Ava DuVernay, known for last year's "Selma," now enters the documentary field with 13th, a provocative take on the nation's prison system. DuVernay argues that the legacy of slavery is responsible for the mass incarceration of African-Americans, who are disproportionately represented behind bars today.

DuVernay goes further by maintaining that those incarcerated today are victims of a new kind of slavery. She reviews the shameful history of the discriminatory treatment of African Americans as a wholeand specifically references how blacks were unfairly targeted, especially in the South, to compensate for the lost economic advantage of the slave system.

DuVernay explains how after Reconstruction, blacks were intentionally arrested on false or trumped up charges and often found themselves receiving draconian sentences that kept them incarcerated for years. Blacks were used as a labor force in a system that demanded work without compensation and perpetuated a system of de facto slavery.

DuVernay then reviews the history of both economic and cultural discrimination perpetuated against African-Americans up until the Civil Rights era in which most became economically disenfranchised. DuVernay masterfully injects clips from D.W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" (the 1915 film praised by President Wilson who watched it a private screening at the White House), which probably was most responsible for the spreading of the noxious and racist notion of the inherent criminality of African-Americans.

The theme of inherent black criminality was reinforced during the Civil Rights era when leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks were jailed and branded as criminals (going to jail soon became a badge of protest by those opposing the racist establishment). 13th illustrates the turbulence of the Civil Rights era featuring disturbing footage of a black man being assaulted by a mob of whites in broad daylight (later the same footage is juxtaposed with comments from Donald Trump at one of his campaign rallies urging followers to attack a black protester).

DuVernay makes it clear that it was the 1970s, with Nixon's "Law and Order" policies, that led to the expanding numbers of African-Americans in the prison system. Quotations from Nixon's henchmen, including John Ehrlichman, confirm that blacks were intentionally targeted during this period. 

Nixon's "war on drugs" and the subsequent draconian Republican policies during the Reagan Administration were probably most responsible for the startling increase of African Americans in the prison system. Ironically, Duvernay trots out Republican Newt Gingrich, as a critic of America's failed war on drugs policy. It's Gingrich who bemoans the unfair disparity in sentencing between offenders charged with sale or possession of crack, as opposed to "mere" cocaine.

DuVernay is also highly critical of Bill and Hillary ClintonHillary with her references to "super predators" and Bill's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 responsible for reprehensible policies including mandatory minimums (taking away discretion from judges in sentencing) and the "three strikes you're out" law, targeting some convicted of non-violent felonies. While Clinton later apologizes for the deleterious effects of the 1994 bill, the damage cannot be undone.

Perhaps the most revelatory information one takes away from this informative piece concerns the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative think tank responsible for model legislation on behalf of corporations. ALEC was most responsible for the development of private prison companiesthus mass incarceration was seen as a good thing since now individuals could profit from such a system. Later ALEC began advocating for the privatizing of probation and parole services, a new way to meld corporate profit with burgeoning prison populations.

Despite her cogent analysis of what caused the disproportionate numbers of African-Americans in the prison system, DuVernay falls short on offering any alternatives to solve what has become such a vexing problem. There is no acknowledgment here there is a class of violent criminals that must be incarcerated no matter what. The call for alternatives to incarceration, such as drug and educational programs, is fine. But even with the introduction of those programs, there is no guarantee that offenders will take advantage of them.

Given the legacy of slavery and years of discrimination, it's understandable why so many African-Americans have found themselves a statistic in the prison system. Ultimately, however, it's the individual offender who must decide whether to become a law-abiding citizen or not. The substitution of draconian policies with more humane ones is certainly a worthy goalbut will they still work? DuVernay seems to think they will. More skeptical students of human nature may not agree.

"The Bureau of Justice reported that one in three young black males is expected to go to jail or prison during his lifetime, which is an unbelievably shocking statistic." Bryan Stevenson 

The unalterable fact that 1 in 3 young black males can expect to be imprisoned contrasts with 1 in 17 white males with that future. For the U.S. to have 5% of the world's population but 25% of its prisoners is as much as you need to know to think about the need for penal reform in our country.

Ava DuVernay's documentary, 13th, powerfully underscores my first paragraph with facts that show overwhelming prejudice toward blacks, who were supposed to have been liberated from slavery and considered equal. While the film shows some of the stock footage from plantations to Ferguson, where black men are systematically attacked, the thrust of this eminently worthy doc is to show not only the prevailing injustice but also to show the rationale for its roots and its image in contemporary police violence.

When Bill Clinton apologizes for his era's tough law and order legislation (three strikes and you're out, for example), you know the system can share blame for democrats and republicans alike. Ironically Clinton also chastises the Black Lives Matter protesters: "You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter!" Although 13th doesn't offer quick solutions, it does as well as any documentary to point us in the right direction and expose its contradictory effects.

13th is less strident than most about the racial injustices of our society, their roots, and their contemporary legacies. It should be a contender for Oscar best documentary.

I read a review for this doc that spoke about the untrustworthiness of the documentarian due to statistics that were listed in the doc that did not match that of the department of justice. It took my about 5 minutes to clear up the differing statistics. The commenter mentioned that the film lists a 2.4M prison population as of 2014, while the DOJ's report released through the BJS states that the prison population in 2014 was 1.5M. 

The glaring difference between the two figures is very easily explained through the requirements necessary to be included by the BJS study. Anyone who is in a county holding facility for a period less than a year, or anyone being held at an immigration detention center, civil commitment, or an Indian Country facility are not included in the figures stated by the BJS. The Prison Policy Initiative study states that 2.4M people were detained and incarcerated for a period longer than 6 months in 2014 with no other limiting factors applied to their study. 

Checking facts is good, but is worthless if you don't check them well by corroborating multiple sources and reviewing the requirements and limiting factors applied to the statistical studies you are comparing. If you are only checking one source, there is no comparison happening, and you are ultimately just accepting the first response you came across without understanding what is included or not included in that particular study. That is called googling, not fact or source checking.

These are the documentaries that tug at heart strings as well as inflame. These are the documentaries that can help bring about solutions or cause people to further recess into their respective camps. This documentary was a must see.

It's funny how you can know a thing exists but not be aware of it. The title of the documentary, 13th, refers to the 13th amendment: 

"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

The 13th amendment made slavery illegal EXCEPT in the case of punishment for a crime. That is the basis of the documentary as the creator interviews a myriad of people on the issue of crime & punishment, law & order, and the prison industrial complex. 

There are a host of sensitive issues discussed that largely revolve around race and almost as many sensitive images shown which also revolve around race; e.g. criminalizing of certain things, the rapidly growing prison population, the disproportionate and over-representation of Blacks and Latinos in prison and more. This was a bold and daring project and it was excellently done in my view. We got to hear scholars, activists, teachers and even politicians (even a contrite Newt Gingrich was shown) speak about the issue of crime and punishment an all it entails. 

The entire documentary was truly amazing. It was informative, it was insightful, it was inspirational and at the same time invidious. I'd be lying if I said it didn't cause harmful feelings, but I think that was the intent to some degree. There was a definite intent to trigger an emotional response and that it did. Movies that can get you emotionally involved tend to be the best. I'm partial to documentaries anyway. They usually take a lot of research and they usually expose the viewers to things they didn't know. That's precisely what 13th did. Through imagery, narrative and interviews we got to see things we'd just as well assume didn't exist. The prison problem we have does exist and it won't be going away without some real change.
