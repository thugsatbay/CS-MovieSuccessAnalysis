### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Sometimes it feels like Woody Allen is deliberately hit and miss. Every other film appears to be a winner so it's become easy to just skip the mediocre ones. I thought Midnight In Paris was pretty good but I felt like its idea wasn't explored well enough and it became too repetitive. Blue Jasmine is a film that feels like it'll be another basic story at first then as the tragedy slowly unravels, it becomes all the more fascinating. At first the film's structure of flashbacking without transition is a little frustrating as the present time doesn't give you much to chew on in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that this was the only way to tell this brilliant and complex story of a woman's place in the world. Cate Blanchett is setting the reviews on fire and she certainly deserves it. I've always loved her engrossing theatrical style in films like The Aviator and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and I've missed her since.

Here she is in full force as she switches from glamour to glare seamlessly and effortlessly. Blanchett has often played strong women and she tiptoes the line of Jasmine's strength and vulnerability both with and without sympathy. It's incredible to watch. Although I was concerned I was going to only appreciate the performance and not connect with the character, I ended up finding her struggle to feel useful in the working world and not knowing how to achieve her ambitions to cut deep into the first world human anxieties about identity and self- worth. It's great to have a film that addresses those issues so earnestly, without feeling self- pitying. Although the spotlight is on her, there's plenty of room for the supporting players to shine with the delightful comic relief performances from Louis C.K., Michael Stuhlberg and Max Casella and deceptively charming performances from Alec Baldwin, Andrew Dice Clay and Peter Sarsgaard. The real talent on the side belongs to Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale who give compelling and heartbreaking performances.

I like how Allen has such confidence in his shooting style of simple wides and closeups that he doesn't let it get in the way of the story but sometimes it does feel bland rather than just Woody's brand. It sometimes feels like the story is taking uninteresting broad strokes with its archetypes but when the details come in like a mystery novel, they enrichen the story and leave just before they drown you making you want more. Perhaps Allen could've made a better job of making me intrigued in the details but that makes the pay-offs all the more sweeter. However, I'm not quite sure what to make of the ending, perhaps Allen is trying to say there's some people who can and can't be fixed, I'm not sure, but it's a fascinating tragic comic tale nonetheless. Maybe it's intended as a punishment film regarding the sin of greed. That would make sense though it wouldn't be as satisfying. It's been compared to A Streetcar Named Desire a lot but I don't remember much of that story despite having seen it twice. I think I prefer Blue Jasmine. One of Allen's most unsuspecting heavyweight films in a long time.

If you want to see this year's master class in screen acting, you need to watch Cate Blanchett's mesmerizing performance as Jasmine French, a delusional Park Avenue socialite wife in Woody Allen's 45th directorial effort, a sly, bicoastal update of Tennessee Williams' classic "A Streetcar Named Desire". As the film opens, her impeccably dressed character has hit rock bottom after her financial wizard of a husband is arrested and her assets are liquidated. In the throes of a nervous breakdown, she arrives in San Francisco and moves in with her kind- hearted sister Ginger who lives a modest, blue-collar life in a tiny apartment on the edge of the Mission  on South Van Ness near 14th Street to be exact - with her two hyperactive sons. You can tell Jasmine is not only out of her element but quite judgmental about how her sister's life has turned out. The irony of Jasmine's patronizing attitude is that she is a habitual liar who is so angry about her destitute circumstances that she frequently talks to herself. The story follows the basic outline of "Streetcar" but takes some interesting turns, for instance, when she tries to better herself by taking computer classes while working as a receptionist at a dental office.

Allen has crafted his film into a clever juxtaposition of current and past events that feels jarring at first since it reflects Jasmine's precarious mental state but then melds into a dramatic arc which resonates far more than a straightforward chronology could have allowed. As a writer, he has become more vociferous in his dialogue without losing his wit. He doesn't pull punches when he showcases confrontations between his characters, whether it's between the two sisters, men and women, or people from different classes. Hostility can come in flammable torrents or in thinly veiled remarks. That Allen moves so dexterously in tone is a testament to his sharp ability in drawing out the truth in his actors. Blanchett is a wonder in this regard because there is something intensely fearless in her approach. Unafraid to lose audience sympathy for her character, she finds an innate sadness in Jasmine that makes us want to know what happens to her next. She also mines the sharp, class- based humor in Jasmine's struggles with one highlight a hilariously executed scene in a pizza restaurant where she explains to her confused nephews to "Tip big, boys".

The rest of the cast manage effective turns. Alec Baldwin plays Jasmine's swindler husband with almost effortless aplomb. Sally Hawkins brings a wonderful looseness to Ginger, Stella to Blanchett's Blanche, and finds a level of poignancy in her character's constant victimization at the hands of her sister as well as her brutish, blue-collar boyfriend Chili, played with comic fierceness by Bobby Cannavale in the Stanley Kowalski role. In a conveniently conceived role, Peter Sarsgaard gets uncharacteristically breezy as Dwight, a wealthy, erudite, and matrimonially available State Department diplomat who appears to be the answer to Jasmine's prayers, while Allen casts two unlikely comics in about-face roles  Andrew Dice Clay as Ginger's defeated ex-husband Augie and Louis C.K. as Al, an amorous suitor who brings Ginger a few moments of romantic salvation. Allen's European sojourn appears to have freed him up with the movement of characters in scenes and Javier Aguirresarobe's ("Vicky Cristina Barcelona") camera-work complies nicely. The San Francisco locations bring a nice geographic change to Allen's storytelling, and he only uses the Golden Gate Bridge in a long shot once from the Marin side. This is Allen's best work in quite a while, and Blanchett is the ideal muse for his tale.

I thought this was Woody Allen's best film in years. The script was better written than I expected from him at this point, given his more recent turns toward drama, and the laughs are often derived as much from the dark humor in the characters' situations as from snappy punch lines. Kudos to Cate Blanchett who turns in a stellar performance, actors sometimes broadly interpret Woody's neurotic characters for comedic effect, more the way Woody would play the role (think Judy Davis), but Cate very effectively plays it straight and my guess is she'll be taking home the next best actress Oscar. For me the biggest surprise was Andrew Dice Clay, who gives a surprising nuanced performance as a working class guy bitter about having been screwed over by big shots, and in some ways his character morally anchors the film. Good job, Woody.

Cate Blanchett gives her best acting performance of all time. Her character changes dramatically every scene. There will be nominations in the future for CB - in my opinion. Woody Allen punk-ed himself with the French nanny angle. Andrew Dice Clay was spectacular. Sally Hawkins stole many scenes in this movie. 

This movie was a commentary on the gluttony of Wall Street & Finance...on many levels. 

It also pointed out the desperation of people suffering from mental health issues. 

I recommend seeing Blue Jasmine. You will not be disappointed.

Woody Allen's finely tuned screen-writing skills and his talent for eliciting standout and often award-winning performances from his leading ladies are on full display in "Blue Jasmine." Alec Baldwin, the slick husband of a middle-aged socialite, Cate Blanchett, pulls a Bernie-Madoff swindle and ends up in jail. The homes, the cars, the furs, the jewels, the furniture all go to the Feds, and the penniless Cate flies first class to San Francisco with her Louis Vuitton luggage to stay with her non-biological sister, Sally Hawkins, until she gets back on her feet. Blanchett, the Jasmine of the title, is totally unprepared for her economic fall. She decides to become an interior designer, but wants to study on-line; however, she is computer illiterate and must take a course, before she can begin to study decorating; but, she needs money for the courses and takes a receptionist job with a lecherous dentist. Although the film addresses serious issues, the Allen humor will provoke smiles and an occasional chuckle, from small well-observed moments such as the attempts of indecisive patients to make dental appointments.

Understandably, Cate Blanchett's Jasmine teeters on the edge of a nervous breakdown; she lies instinctively, even to herself; and she cannot or will not face the reality of her downward mobility. The role is an actress's showcase, and Blanchett is in top form; her nervous rambling monologues, either to herself or to unwilling strangers, provide a study guide for aspiring actors. Jasmine brays at her "sister," Ginger, effortlessly and engagingly played by Hawkins; she nags about Ginger's job, lover, and living quarters, until Ginger points out Jasmine's own diminished situation. Jasmine bellows that Ginger can do better than her amorous boyfriend, Chili, a charismatic Bobby Cannavale with a bad haircut and faded tattoo; eventually, Ginger reminds her that her own choice of husband was less than stellar. Jasmine, Ginger, and Chili make an aromatic trio, whose names perhaps allude to their personalities, and they are ably supported by Louis C.K., a horny guy with the hots for Ginger, and Peter Sarsgaard, a respectable diplomat seeking a suitable wife for his political career.

In keeping with the film's title, Woody uses blues on the soundtrack, and his cinematographer, Javier Aguirresrobe, lenses the dual New York and San Francisco locales effectively. Although the jump cuts in time are jarring initially, viewers will quickly accommodate to New York being the past and San Francisco the present. Woody at age 78 is a master writer, especially of women's characters, and "Blue Jasmine" finds him at his best. Although Woody's trademark humor flickers throughout, the film is essentially about a vulnerable woman standing amidst the ruins of her former life and facing a precariously uncertain future. Audiences may come out praising the performers, but humming the blues.

One of the better movies Woody Allen has put out in recent years, featuring superior performances by Cate Blanchett as an emotionally unstable woman forced to come down from her privileged past and Sally Hawkins as her enabling lower-income sister. Allen's screenplay is often amusing although it meanders at times (I looked at my watch more than once during the screening I attended) and its story seems uncomfortably reminiscent of "A Streetcar Named Desire" with Blanchett in the Blanche DuBois role, Sally Hawkins as Stella, Peter Sarsgaard as Mitch and Bobby Cannavale as Stanley Kowalski. It lacks the dramatic power and sexual tension of Tennessee Williams' masterpiece and in the end, Allen's urbane sophistication doesn't make up for it.

There is a tendency in recent years to either over-praise Allen or rip him to shreds. I don't think this film deserves either fate, being an enjoyably diverting if occasionally pretentious and derivative comedy/drama. It may not belong in the pantheon of great Woody Allen movies like "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan" but it's no "Curse of the Jade Scorpion" or "Celebrity" either. If it didn't have the Woody Allen brand on it, I suspect that it would quickly come and go without notice as a fairly well-made independent drama with some nice acting that has some gripping sequences while ultimately being a little on the dull side. Because of Allen's enduring reputation, it will probably pick up an Oscar nomination or two (for Blanchett's performance and for Allen's questionably "original" screenplay) because Allen's name still carries cache with the taste arbiters. It had too many dull stretches and redundant exchanges for that kind of attention for my money, but its high points made me feel like there were worse ways to spend an hour and a half.

when the movie was over the audience sat there somewhat stunned and completely silent... was crazy... crazy is the literal word to use.

the main character is so vivid and sad and real.

the film is a roller coaster ride of drama and comedy... of awkward humor and goofy then disturbing.

the use of flashbacks are done seamlessly and works well to tell the back story of this amazing character.

there are a few things that maybe don't work here and there but 80 percent of this film is cate blanchette and she really is perfect.

at times it's woodyy allen-ish and at other times you forget and are sucked in by blanchette.

rest of cast is great... andrew dice clay is awesome in a very toned down role, louie ck is great is a small part... sally hawkins is awesome in her own way and very different from her sister jasmine... bobby carnivale chews some scenery.

if this movie sucks you in you will have a hard time forgetting it for a while... it hangs with you.

Just saw Woody Allen's latest film today in theaters and after all these years, he still hasn't lost his touch. Cate Blanchett completely steals the show here, being the most interesting character by far. What a powerful and emotional performance (the best I've seen from her)! There are several hilarious moments involving her, but you will also feel the state of depression she's in, even damaging her mental health. In addition, I really enjoyed the way Woody tells the story, always going back and forth in time. The ending was truly devastating and as usual, the dialogues are some of the highlights in this film. Blue Jasmine is definitely much better than Woody's previous work, To Rome with Love, which I thought it was pretty weak overall. I'm glad to see this great director back in top form, with another remarkable film again.

Loved the script, loved the cast, loved all the performances, but dear God, Cate Blanchett was so incredible I couldn't catch a breath. What a performance! So many emotions at the same time, so multi-layered, subtle and yet unbearable.... She takes a character one normally wouldn't really care about where she ends up to someone, who despite her tragic and repeated mistakes and the fact that she made her own bed, you send up caring about, you end up understanding her. 

Blanchett took a huge risk with that emotionally exposing role and proved herself to be master and commander. If any other actress had played that role, it wouldn't even be half as good. Her theatrical background and experience is all concentrated in in Jasmine. Heart-wrenching, powerful and utterly vulnerable at the same time, cruel but simultaneously caring in her very own way... 

It's the performance of the decade for me and one of the best of all times, a true masterclass.

And as Letterman told Blanchett when she was a guest at his show (not really a fan of his but what he said was totally true), even if he had directed the film instead of Allen, the result would still have been a masterpiece because of Cate.

What a treat! Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance as a Blanche-like character written and directed by the most prolific American author of the last 40 years. Cate seems to be an actress without emotional borders. Jasmine walks a very tight rope, her sense of despair etched in her magnificent face vanishes ipso facto when she meets Peter Sarsgaard. She realizes in a sort of disbelief -extraordinary, heartbreaking and horribly funny moment - that he could be the rescue raft in her own personal tsunami. Sally Hawkins, another stroke of genius in the casting department, is a profoundly human creature very much the Stella of the situation. This two sisters, adopted both from different parents are also from different, if immediately recognizable, universes. I could go on and on but I'm not going to, I just wanted to urge you, in this times of 3D super extra loud marvel sequels, to run and see it.

This is not an enjoyable film. I could appreciate Cate Blanchette's truly great performance but after a while I hoped there would be something else. It is obviously a morality tales about the section of New York society that is shallow, materialistic and callous, but we got this message and all about Jasmine fairly quickly. There was nothing else - that was it. As we continued to follow her downward path, I had expected the ray of light about the future. Instead we got a more detailed description of the past, even though she had already told us all there was to know about her history. There was never a sign that the penny had dropped about what was really important in life. All we ever got was an indication that things were going to get even worse without even a hint of redemption. Thoroughly depressing. When they give out the Oscar I can say I saw it, but that is a small consolation.

Kate Blanchett deserves best actress for her performance in Blue Jasmine.

What an amazing film! But more so, what an amazing actress Kate Blanchett is! I always say, great actors do not act, they just are the role. If an actor has to get into the character, then they should have done something else with their lives. Because Kate Blanchett does not act, she just IS the character. She just steps into the role she is playing. She makes it look easy, even when she plays somebody that is losing her mind. Still, as hard as it was for my wife and I to see that role she played, I am glad I saw the movie. WOW!! The closest thing I can remember to this performance, and storyline, was the famous movie "Frances" played by, of course, [ also ] the great Jessica Lange. That is another movie to see! Very intense. But really, you have to take yourself to see this movie. I love Kate Blanchett! She is of course beautiful, talented, magical and most of all, she has absolutely no ego. She throws herself into the role, and if need be, grovel and exhibit the pain of the common man ( woman ) having gone thru life's' tragedies that are unfortunately so common with today's average person.

At the movies' end I said to my wife "Kate's acting reminds me of Gollum" in that famous scene at the end of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, where Gollum is in the forest and his multiple personalities show themselves as he struggles to best decide the fate of his Hobbit counterparts and get that elusive ring back. I would definitely say that Kate Blanchett's characters are every bit as twisted as Gollum, and yet still has something inside of her that is still worthy of redemption. As Frodo said "I pity him Sam. I could not kill Sméagol, for I still see good in him"  to paraphrase badly.

And so it is with Jasmine, having lost herself into the world of materialism and other people's money, having hit the very bottom, can she salvage what's left of her soul and find the humanity she lost.

This movie will really make you think.

Kate Blanchett is a major blessing to the film industry and to the world.

She really deserves Best Actress in2014 Academy Awards.

I took my seat for the new Woody Allen movie 'Blue Jasmine' with some misgivings: he hasn't made a truly great film since Deconstructing Harry (and maybe Sweet & Lowdown), a good 15 years ago now, so I did not have any great hopes for this one. But, I do still keep checking them out from time to time, just in case. And here I was, back again.

It began pretty slow and overly stagy, the way many of Woody's weaker efforts are wont to do, but slowly I got more and more engrossed in the story, and especially Cate Blanchett's performance, which really is as amazing as everyone says, and must surely bag her the best actress award at the next Oscars.

It's been pointed out before that in some ways the story is simply 'Woody does Streetcar Named Desire', and there's something to that, although, like his very best movie 'Stardust Memories' (from one point of view a most overt tribute to Fellini's '8 1/2') it is still a Woody Allen film through and through, clearly unfolding in his world, through his own unique set of lenses.

Something that really grabbed me I don't think I've seen anyone else point out is that the twist of the film is (spoilers!) that this greedy, pampered, narcissistic woman - who we have nevertheless been viewing as an innocent victim of her unfaithful husbands crooked business dealings - the twist is that she herself, and ONLY herself, is responsible for her own ruin, that everything that befalls her throughout the film was set in motion through her own actions. 

As I say, I don't think I've heard anyone else draw attention to the gravity of that yet, what it says about the modern victim mentality of the Oprah age we are living in, but it's stayed with me for quite some time, and ultimately is what what marks the film out above pretty much all Woody's other films this century.

Best Woody's made in years, a tour de force by Cate Blanchett and great support from Sally Hawkins and all the cast. For anyone who loves 'Streetcar' this is a sly and skillful homage, updating some threads for 21st century life while lifting other scenes almost directly from Elia Kazan's 1950s classic. Happily the wife-beating is in the past, but Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) is nevertheless Jasmine's nemesis, a brooding presence and harbinger of doom for the NY socialite whose life is unraveling before us. I don't usual wince audibly in the theatre but some scenes are so raw and toe-curling I couldn't help it, you're constantly oscillating between laughter and tears.

Ceaselessly the woman talks at the elderly lady next to her: on the plane, at the airport, waiting for their luggage. Only when her husband picks her up, she is able to free herself from the incessant flood of words. This is how Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen's latest film begins. It ends with the same woman sitting down on a park bench, talking again. The lady sitting beside her gets up and leaves, the talker does not even notice. In these two scenes  so similar and yet so different  Allen frames his tale of Jasmine whose real name is Jeanette. A woman who, married to a rich financial entrepreneur, once was at the heart of New York City's high society. Now she must relocate to San Francisco, to live with her despised sister. When her husband's criminal activities were discovered and he subsequently hung himself in his cell, she lost everything: her jewels, her money, her footing, her mental balance. This is Woody Allen's take on the financial crisis, bankers spun out of control, the Bernie Madoffs of this world.

He looks at the effects on someone who once profited from the fraudulent schemes and then fell from grace, one who so internalized the artificial world she chose to live in that now she cannot leave it. Try as she may, she cannot return to reality, moving from daydreaming escapes to the past to empty illusions about her future, unable to grasp the necessities of the life she must now live. Blue Jasmine tells the story of what happens when you live in a fake world and are thrown into the real world. It is the tragedy of a woman caught in her dream, one she cannot give up anymore. She is the victim we have a hard time pitying, the winner who loses everything while she goes on believing that everyone else is a loser around her.

Cate Blanchett is Jasmine and she gives the strongest performance to date in a career full of memorable performances. She plays Jasmine between hysteria and desperation and slowly maps her subtle descend from overwrought nervous tension into a stupor equally induced by alcohol, prescriptions drugs, self-delusions and a complete failure at getting to terms with reality. She is broke, yet flies first class, she moves in with her sister who bags groceries at a local store, yet travels with Louis Vuitton suitcases  none of this being a contradiction in her mind. Blanchett is spectacular in the radical way with which he merges with her deconstructing and dissolving character. She carries the film with her characters' helpless attempts at dignity, her ridiculous pretense, her losing any grip in her life and her mind. Sally Hawkins as her sister is a wonderful counterpart: down to earth, yet full of the same desire to have a better life, the same dissatisfaction with what she has. But while she comes around to accepting what she has, no matter how little that may be. Jasmine cannot.

Allen moves back and forth between the present and flashbacks of the past, often caused by a sudden memory or the topic of a conversation. Strangely, it is those past scenes that feel more real. Whereas the dreary present is drenched in a pale, vague sunny light, giving it a slightly unreal, dream like feel, corresponding well with the nostalgic jazz soundtrack Allen has chosen, the memories seem sharper, more matter of fact, more plausible. This reflects Jasmine's perception: for her the fake is the real and the real a nightmare she must wake up from. And it seems she might: love enters, a chance to resume the life she once had and for a short time, the old socialite returns, the façade though a little cracked is polished and looks as good as new. But all falls apart again, and night falls on Jasmine.

Blue Jasmine is Woody Allen's first drama in a long time. Although he does, at times, allow his portrait of Jasmine to touch on the caricaturesque, the film remains too close to her existential desperation to allow for cathartic laughter. Instead the film, despite the essentially unlikable title character, is a touching story about the delusion of those who believe in the fake, who build their lives on dreams and self-deception, who invent a life so thoroughly that they come to believe in it. And it shows a society built on the principle of make belief  and the willingness of many to defy logic for the blind faith in the god of money. Yes, some of the plot twists are a little implausible, yes, the contrast between the phony rich and the ultimately good-hearted poor, is a little simplistic, but overall Blue Jasmine is an entirely convincing study of the dissolution of a self, carried by a focused direction and an acting performance that is great beyond belief, making this Woody Allen's strongest film in a long time.

The former socialite Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) travels from New York to San Francisco to stay in the simple house of her stepsister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) that lives with her two sons. Jasmine was married with the successful businessman Hal (Alec Baldwyn) that felt in disgrace for being considered a crook and committed suicide in prison. Jasmine is completely broken and mentally unstable with recollection from her previous social life and uses anti-depressive along the day. 

Jasmine does not approve Ginger's boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale) that she considers a loser, the same feeling she had with Ginger ex-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay). Jasmine has no profession to work and support herself and she accepts the position of receptionist in a dentist's clinic. When Jasmine is invited to a party, she asks Ginger to go with her. Ginger meets the sound engineer Al (lluis C.K.) that she believes is a better catch than Chili. Meanwhile the gold-digger Jasmine meets the diplomat Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) and she believes she will advance in her social position.

"Blue Jasmine" is a movie by Woody Allen with a story of delusiveness about a woman that does not want to see and accept the reality and the consequences of her attitude in a moment of tantrum. Cate Blanchett has good performance in the role of a fashionable woman from the high- society that loses everything and need to live in the house of her working class stepsister. The plot uses flashbacks to show Jasmine's life and has a plotting point in the end when the fall of Hal is explained. My vote is eight.

I have no idea what movie the people who rated this highly were watching. It certainly wasn't the one that me and a couple hundred other people watched today. Every conversation I overheard walking out was about how the acting was great but the movie was awful. There were a few people whose conversations I didn't overhear because they left the movie early.

The acting, and in particular Cate Blanchett's, was outstanding and the only reason my wife and I didn't join the others leaving early. 

Let me put this in perspective: I am a big fan of Woody Allen, but this movie so was so awful that I was compelled to create an IMDb account and express my displeasure.

All of the viewer reviews I read about this movie were glowingly positive. And with an outstanding 7.9 rating, how could I go wrong going to see it? Woody Allen used to make good, clever funny movies. Big mistake.

I'm here to tell you this is an awful movie. The characters are boring, irritating, annoying stupid creatures about whom I could care less. Even the ones that started with some credibility, lost it. The actors all did a decent job of playing the rolls they were given, but the script was uninspiring and the story just lame and pointless. One of the other reviewers mentioned how when the movie ended the audience sat in stunned silence. I took it to mean from awe or reverence. Now I know it's because the movie has no ending. If the projector broke with thirty minutes left to go in the movie, people would be howling with anger and demanding their money back, but if the writer/director leaves out the last 20 or 30 minutes of the story and then tacks on the credits, everyone thinks this is cool and clever and innovative. 

I feel like a guy standing in the crowd watching the emperor strut down the street stark naked and all around me the people are oohing and aahing over his beautiful royal garments. What garments? The guy is jiggling, hairy, stark naked, for crying out loud! This is not a wonderful movie. It was a potentially interesting story that got lost somewhere along the way. Don't get sucked in by the hype.

Predictable, obvious, conventional, trite, and stereotypical are words that came to mind as I seethed, mumbling in my seat, watching a film that was "acclaimed" by many critics. Unfortunately this was another Woody Allen writing and directorial disappointment and that makes me angry. I really wanted Allen to embrace me with sensitivity and conviction; to make me laugh and cry, to create characters that were distinctive and demonstrated individuality like he did in the 1999 film SWEET AND LOWDOWN. Instead BLUE JASMINE, which ostensibly speaks about class divide, pretension, financial immorality, and the fickleness of relationships, focuses on a woman named Jasmine played by Cate Blanchett who is in the midst of having a nervous breakdown and moves in with her "lower-class" sister in San Francisco.

Cate Blanchett's performance as Jasmine, who had been married to a very wealthy, Bernie Madoff-type businessman Hal (a smooth and slick Alec Baldwin,) living a life as the beautiful Park Avenue socialite wife entertaining, doing charity work, and filling her time with Yoga and Pilates is vapidly inconsistent. We are subject to constant flashbacks of her former luxurious life then, contrasted with her penniless life "now,"  before and after the collapse of her seemingly "idyllic high-style" marriage. We are made privy very earlier in the movie, to Jasmine's histrionic and melodramatic fall from grace. Her excessive drinking, her devouring pills with an avariciously bumbling urgency, all dramatic gestures that imply desperation were repeated over and over again - a view of psychic disintegration that was hackneyed and tired  a picture of nervous collapse pigeonholed into burlesque.

Personally I did not give a damn about any of the characters...except Jasmine's sweet, good- natured sister Ginger  a natural and beautiful performance by Sally Hawkins who picks "working class" guys as her partners  her taste in men being the opposite of her arrogant condescending sister. Many of the reviewers of BLUE JASMINE spoke about a Tennessee William's Streetcar Named Desire subtext to this film  I think that interpretation is superficial, and another indication of Woody Allen's trivialization of the "rank and file" laborer. Just because Bobby Cannavale (who is an actor I loved in THE STATION MASTER) wears cutoff tee-shirts, is muscled up with slicked back hair and has a temper, does not make him Stanley Kowalski; or a fragile Cate Blanchett descending into her interior world of the past, make her Blanche Du Bois. Instead I saw Woody Allen propagating a boilerplate view of class through dialects and visuals that were imitative and unimaginative.

Relationships between siblings, heedless gratification of desire, and the cynical view of the battle of the sexes are always prevalent in Woody Allen's films. I hope I get to see one soon which is genuine, fresh and authentic. I thought BLUE JASMINE might fulfill those criteria I was dispiritedly mistaken.

Woody may have once been a comedian, but he now has produced one of the most depressing movies in years. Even Cate Blanchett cannot save this derivative, dark and pointless study in modern melt downs a la Bernie Madoff. He also makes the ultimate cardinal sin of modern film making; letting the geography completely contradict the action and tone of the film. What is left is an emotional jumble that never lets the audience breathe. And the ultimate problem is that Woody just has not only lost his sense of place, but the characters do not work when the emotional drift is all down hill. Woody, San Francisco may not be your cup of tea, but as a back drop, it is not New Orleans. If you are going to do Streetcar Named Desire, you have to be able to show a little more of real emotion, and realistic doom and despair. This film is an idea that was never worked out. Because the real tragedy here is the film itself, not the plot.

This Allen film has some pedigree and within the first 30 minutes its clear he has sharpened the pencil well for the writing of his principal character, Jasmine or Jeanette.

Later on, with the other male characters who are part of her sister's life, a nagging feeling comes on. This is like...what was that play about a delusional sister and her brother-in-law and the steamy life in that southern city... Oh yes, it was "A Streetcar Named Desire".

The template for this is movie is so close to Williams's play that it is well, uncanny, but Allen has form here; with his Bergman pastiches and his nods to Henry James, he knows how to plumb other work- perhaps its all so well absorbed he hardly knows the difference between his own work and theirs. As TS Eliot said, great artists steal.

Tarantino does it with everything he has ever done; Allen just appeals to the middle class who don't read the source material and this format flatters their informed sense for what is good drama.

The movie is pleasant enough; it falters at times and goes around and around, and has very lazy plotting, it deals a few morals blasts to Wall St and greed, cupidity, amongst other sins, but it never develops well. It's a slight story based on another work.

Blanchett is fine, and like the original Blanche, she, along with the author, has often depended on the kindness of strangers. It's nearly a perfect fraud.

I have never been interested in any Woody Allen films in the past, but over the course of the past year or so, I have gradually become interested in his films and I'm glad because he is actually a film genius, as evident from this film, Blue Jasmine. Blue Jasmine offers a roller-coaster ride of emotions from light comedy to downright depressing. Woody offers up his distinct style of dialog in his screenplay and it's put to good use by Cate Blanchett who delivers one of her best career performances.

Woody Allen's film is about a woman named Jasmine who was quite a rich socialite in Manhattan married to a wealthy businessman named Hal. When Hal is arrested for swindling, Jasmine loses her home and wealth and is forced to move to San Francisco to move in with her sister, Ginger. From there, we see the emotions Jasmine goes through as she is having a hard time moving on.

As said before, Cate Blanchett may have given her best performance and that is a tough feat. Her emotion is so raw and her pain is so real and even though I don't care for people with her kind of snobby attitude, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for her. Alec Baldwin does a good job as Hal, the man with the money and the affairs. Sally Hawkins delivers quite a performance as Ginger, who is suffering from problems of her own. Finally, Bobby Cannavale does a great job as Ginger's boyfriend who makes it clear his distrust for Jasmine.

Overall, Blue Jasmine is an excellent film but I'm not sure if being labeled as a comedy would work in its favor. The movie is just too depressing at times. I was also reminded of the Bernie Madoff scandal here and Jasmine seems to deliver the emotions Madoff's wife must have gone through. This is a well-acted and well-written film that touches upon the subject of life-altering changes and their effects. I rate this film 9/10.

is a good movie but it's not the best of Allen ...does not have the complexity of"Melinda And Melina" nor the dramatic depth of Annie Hall...but with great actresses like Cate Blanchett all is best ... is inspired in the"Madoff Asunto" but the lack of depth of history wasted what could have been a good psychological thriller...is wasted to a great actor like Alec Baldwin granting him only fleeting appearances and it seems that Allen's films while less wealth script are more colorful are the photograph as to compensate (I remember Manhattan in black and white or opacity of Annie Hall that not undermined the excellent screenplay) My final words: you have to see it because it's Woody...is acceptable ... and it can enjoy the Cate Blanchett beauty

Blue Jasmine is the first Woody Allen movie (aside from possibly Match Point) that I not only didn't hate, but actually loved since Sweet and Lowdown.

Allen went back to school and relearned story structure, character development and pacing. Laugh out loud funny from moment one until the end, with the best ensemble by far (they actually seemed like they were real people and not just du jour stars acting in a Woody Allen movie!).

Cate Blanchett gives the best performance of her career or anyone else's in a long time (with kudos to her obvious rubric, Judy Davis, who she channels marvelously throughout). 

And Andrew Dice Clay will make you cry; so glad to see him being used in such a clever way. He deserves this.

This will absolutely sweep all awards, and for the first time in over a decade, the Allen crew will have actually earned it!! No more resting on laurels and skirting by on "Well, yeah it had some problems, but that one part was soooo funny/good ..."

Hope he stays in the U.S. Clearly it does him some much needed good after his prolonged Euro vacation.

It's a great and unexpected surprise when Woody can beat both the Coens and the French these days in a film about delusion and self. I'm not a fan of his overall trajectory and predilections, but I won't deny any film its effectiveness. 

Woody here pierces through to the essential thing. It's a film about modern suffering but that is clearly seen here as attachment to internal narrative, not just a general thickness around being. He maintains inextricability; it is both her fault and a life of circumstance with no clean separation. The woman still carries echoes of that previous narrative around her, soon it becomes clear that the explanatory flashbacks are hallucinated after the fact.

Overall Woody here arrives at a tender admission. It would be all too easy to discard or condemn her as pampered and sheltered, this is only part of the thrust here. He doesn't romanticize privilege the way Sofia Coppola is prone to, another plus: we're called to sympathize with more than a victim. The admission is that life in its course of being lived leaves indelible marks in the story of who you are, that this is only real to the extend that you inhabit the story, and yet that's it's genuinely hard to distinguish one self from the other.

He doesn't give this internal world to us with particular visual richness, few filmmakers his age do. There is 'color and shape', tied to the narrator's vivid imagination who aspires to be an 'interior designer', but Woody could have done so much more with the logic of memory. No, the real effect here is geared in the combination of asking the multilayered Blanchett to inhabit a character who inhabits and continuously recalls a story. She's marvelous. She seems to know the degree to which Jasmine blurs the recalled story to be only about color and appearances is the same one to which she blurs the current one, true love from convenience, responsibility from mere absent-mindedness, all these Blanchett truly, genuinely blurs around the character she inhabits.

It's deceptively easy to consume this thinking Jasmine knew in advance or was never in love, be aware and sensitive to this difference. It blooms once you reflect back on it, inhabit her world instead of pass through with moral superiority, because doing this means that your own tools of defining truth must be called into judgement. 

It's a fine film, much better than the hollow inhabiting of his Midnight. This one cuts. A Woman Under the Influence appears to have been a template, Jasmine's muttering to herself on the street is a reference. Like that film, it is as much the filmmaker's as the actresses' creation, impossible without the richness Blanchett fleshes with.
