### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film, please allow me to describe what I love about the books.

Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty, these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary, yet wholly embraced- even celebrated- by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes, they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same, some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses, it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However, these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given, and violence a sad but expected part of life.

The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death- heart-wrenching in the book- is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all, including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.

Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button, she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.

The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping, they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol, in contrast, is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was well-done. However, the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.

There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately, this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible, given the subject matter, but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.

I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead, he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.

One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a self-destructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.

This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 3/10 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead.

OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the "let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the "citizens" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow "is this really it?" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few "ups" for me among the many "downs" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a "sugar-monster" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying "only hope is stronger than fear", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...

Simply, many over the age of 18 read these books and loved them, and it wasn't because there was a girl, a boy, and another boy in a love story. It was about an awful political system where children faced to the death for their survival with awful paragraphs of cruel brutality. This is part of what made the book unique. The movie, was an attempt to draw a crowd like Twilight for money, and completely blurred out children killing each other to survive so that it could be made PG13. Ridiculous. Jennifer Lawerence is an AWESOME actress though, and she did a great job. Throughout the movie I was never convinced that she lived in district 12 nearly starving... or that Peeta was dying in the hunger games.. it was all very pretty and not anything like I imagined they would do with it. Oh well, maybe they'll remake a rated R version some day that adequately portrays the books theme.

The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.

On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. "Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.

Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.

Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.

Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.

Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.

After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll.

like everyone else, before going to the movies I stopped on IMDb and read a few criticisms of the film - both those with better than average grade, and worse. But I think it's finally time to wonder what is the purpose of this time consuming ritual. because when a little thought, in few years back, i found that just a couple of films is well characterized with the average grade on this site. 

but here, not only that I stopped with this habit, I decided to write my first review. for me like for many others with first reviews, trigger is terrible dissatisfaction with seen. I did not read the book nor did I know until yesterday that this film is another adaptation. for the book I do not know, but the movie turned out, on my sorrow, to be for children up to 14 years maximum - the magic of 21st century and advertising machinery. 

After the first few minutes of the film when you realize you're 28 year old who is stuck with teenage movie and after you realize what would not just the end, but everything, look like, you tell yourself: ''sit back and at least try to enjoy visual side of the movie''. but that too ceases to be an option once you realize that you are about throw up because some producer decided it was more fun instead of continuous motion of camera to record in the way: cut-ear, cut-leg, cut-tree in the background,cut-somebody runs, cut-Hair... and all that in 0.3 second and from different - all possible angles. must be seen to be believed. but even that is not the worst, because imagine what the feeling of nausea you get when you realize that the hour of the movie is spent to describe the characters and get nothing better then awful cliché: bad guys are trained, arrogant bullies that smile too much and of course despite the superhuman strength, arrogant like that, they must be kicked by the petite 16 year old shy girl. but since this is still a children's movie, you will not literally see bloody action scenes where this brave archer girl kills super-strong and skilled bullies, but you will rather see scenes where those skilled bullies can not figure out how to catch a girl who ran away from them to a tree, so they decide camp under a tree until this girl alone does not get hungry and climb down. but because it was cold, of course, the bullies get cold so they find it was smart thing to make a fire and warm themself, but not too close to tree as it could catch on fire and kill a girl they've been chasing to kill.

:)

To conclude, if you're not 14 year old teenager, this is not a movie for you. don't get yourself tricked like I did.

cheers

Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the "The Hunger Games" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.

"The Hunger Games" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.

I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.

The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too "hot" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.

Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.

The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.

People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope "The Hunger Games" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league.

The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book.

In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. 

This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.

A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.

A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the "greater good" and fun of a bent society. 

Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.

The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?

The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.

First let me say, I love the books.

Now let me voice my problems with the movie:

Acting:

Actors were good, I actually expected a worse performance. My problem was a lack of character development, they felt very flat, you don't link with the necessity of Katniss to win.

Plot:

They are called the HUNGER GAMES. They have to suffer, they have to fight for food, they have to kill each other. They made an R rated book a PG-13 movie and they expect it to work ? The fight had to be brutal like it was in the book, the tension of them moving in an arena that was trying to kill them didn't exist in the movie.

The political implications you never understood them, you don't get that sense people in the other districts are linked in some way to the capitol, you don't sense people in the other districts has to suffer to great extents to find food. 

Development:

The movie is freaking slow, I was failing sleep, mind you I finished the books in 18 hours non stop of reading. There are some useless scenes, others are too long and the important ones are too fast.

Camera:

Please kill the director and his stupid shaky camera, it was annoying. He failed to portrait the suffering of the participants, the action, the fights.

I hope they do something for the next two or else I wont watch them. They need a better director, screenplay and writer.

I will start off by saying that I did not read the books. I'm also one of those people that when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a Battle Royale remake. When I found out it wasn't, I was quite surprised, cause they seemed very similar. You cant always judge a film by it's trailer though. So to be fair, I decided to give this movie a chance, and not go into it comparing the two.

The movie has quite a slow start, and even though they take a long time building up; I didn't get the idea that I was getting to know any of the characters. They really didn't do a good job making any of the characters likable, or let them develop in any way. The main character in this film, Katniss, was already portrayed as a tough girl from the very beginning of the film. Nothing in the first part of the movie did anything to either develop this, or add to it.

When the games finally start, I was kind of excited, because I was looking forward to some action finally. Unfortunately for me; the action was lacking quite a bit. Shaky camera-work, which I guess is meant to be artistic these days, left a lot of the killing to your imagination. Due to lack of character building in the beginning of the film, I didn't really mind who died, cause I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters. On top of that; many scenes from the actual games seem to be lacking dept, reason or logic. It was as if they went for too many scenes in too little time. This resulted into the whole story of the movie being kind of blur to me, and left me wondering if there was even one there.

On a positive note; the acting was quite OK. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed her role quite well, and her acting had nothing to do with me not being able to relate to her character. Elizabeth Banks was splendid, as a character that at first sight seems totally misplaced in this world, but totally works in the way it's portrayed. 

All in all, I'll have to be fair and say I don't quite get the hype. The movie seemed to be lacking in too many areas, in order for me to stay interested throughout the entire two and a half hours. Not comparing this film to Battle Royale while watching it was made quite easy, simply because this wasn't close to being as good. A missed opportunity for an interesting theme like this!

If you are going to make a movie about children being forced to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public, I would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the lines of Shindler's List or at least a tone of some satirical value. And you would think that the angst, fear, disgust and overall awfulness for the main characters would be a focal point. You would think the blood lust of the watching masses would form a visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as a backdrop to all of this. And most of all you would think that children, even children raised to expect that they might someday have to enter a tournament like this, would struggle with a conflict between fear, innocence, longing for some sense of decency and trying to sort through the confusion to survive. 

It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that, or at least neglects to even attempt to address that, by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern. 

The movie seems to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we are watching children kill each other. It is as though we are watching running man - only with 8 year olds. Who doesn't want to watch a movie where adorable little boys and girls snap each other necks? Or dogs run them down and eat them alive...?

If a movie like this is to be done it cannot avoid the moral content without seeming shallow and absently depraved. That is this movie. The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. 

I found it absent, vapid and obviously lacking in any real value. It was also a little sick because it didn't even bother for tone whilst presenting the viewer with a mind bending plot. 

In short, wooden acting, shallow presentation and not at all smart.

One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.

On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.

On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.

Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.

I've never read the books but went to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss was about. "The Hunger Games" I felt was a complete bore. The story unwinds in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the characters. The plot-line itself---people of a dystopian future being made to fight to the death on TV has been done to death (no pun) and done with more wit an imagination in "The Running Man" for instance. The gladiator story is told much better in real gladiator movies like "Gladiator" and "Spartacus" which are both hugely better than "The Hunger Games".

For an action movie it feels like days go by before there is any real action. The "name" actors like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herky-jerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead. The "simulated" monster animals that can actually devour people? Most of the competitors are killed off camera? Come on. . .

Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! 

In "The Hunger Games", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. 

The huge success of "The Hunger Games" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next "Twilight" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least "Battle Royale" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in "The Hunger Games" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.

The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. 

For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.

I was in fact, highly excited to see "The Hunger Games". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, "The Hunger Games" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.

SPOILERS FOR MULTIPLE MOVIES INSIDE.

In the middle of the movie, the most emotional moment, I turned to the right in my row and noticed a woman crying. Within just one minute that turned into several people, herself included, laughing out loud. I've never experienced this before in my life and I think it summarizes really well just how pointless and poorly done this movie is.

In The Running Man (1987) convicts chase each other to death for entertainment of masses. As far as I remember they were all death row inmates and the justification was they were dead already, so we might as well turn their sentences into entertainment. At least one of the contestants was wrongly convicted and fights the game itself.

In Gladiator (2000) fighting to death was based on historical facts. In addition to that the main character was resigned to death because his family was killed by a ruthless psycho ruler. He used the game, which he is forced into anyway, to get to him.

Now we have The Hunger Games. A group of completely innocent kids, one of which was 10 or even younger, are forced to fight to the death. The ruling class is totally thrilled, while the poor subjects watch the live broadcast in hope their kids would come out alive. We are thrown right in the middle of that and the movie does not care to explain to the audience just how a human society managed to degrade to such level as to make gladiator games seem like innocent play. All we know there was a war, and in order to maintain peace we have these Hunger Games which mainly serve as intimidation by the ruling class, but also as American Idol-type entertainment.

Problem #1: The movie ignores the reality of human nature. "Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities" - Mark Twain. Hunger Games attempts to break this rule and it either fails miserably or the audiences are so desensitized that the movie creators did not feel the need to sweat basing the fiction on human nature and realities. Are we really that desensitized? Judging by the praises for this movie, it sure seems tat way. No contestant seemed depressed or try to escape the system, which is what you would expect in such situation. They switch from "I hope they don't pick me" to "ok, how do I win this thing" with equal emotion and mental adjustment to when I change socks. They even quickly start to enjoy the pre-game show.

Problem #2: Even cruel games have rules that can't be changed in the middle of a game. Hunger Games simply does not have any rules in contrast to its own premise of iron-fist control. At one point Katniss is forced back into the game with deadly fireballs on top of a forest fire which she would have to escape to survive. They are literally shooting to kill her, and I am thinking "isn't the forest fire enough to convince her to move on?" The fireballs were completely irrational and unnecessary. They only seemed to place a check mark in front of "this movie has explosions." Then, the control decides to change the rule from "only one can win" to "two can win" and then back to "one can win" once there was only two left. Then it changes that rule again to "two can win" because the game faced an outcome with no winners. This was probably done with the intention to intensify the suspense, but it made the game itself weak and even more pointless than I was willing to swallow. This actually prevented me from forgetting about the impossibly fantastic premise and getting into the game. 

In addition to these 2 philosophical problems, Hunger Games is cinematically mediocre at best. It only does special effects well but nowadays that's a given. Acting reminded me of Terra Nova TV series. In fact the entire movie kind of resembled an episode of Terra Nova. There is only one main character in the movie and the rest are extras. They did not really invest much in the development of supporting roles. Even Katniss was a barely developed role. The boy she is in love with plays no role whatsoever. The boy that has a crush on her is an extra with a crush. I know his character is a supporting role, but it is so poorly developed and acted that I refuse to accept him as one. The makeup and costumes are just plain bizarre. Again, if the movie invested a little bit in the history of how it all came to be.

To summarize, I will mention another peculiar thing about this move. It feels like an open frankensteining from other movies. This new creation feels like all these moves crammed together in a limited amount of time: Acting and settings: Terra Nova TV series or a Star Trek Next Generation feature film. The Capitol city: Alice in Wonderland. The control center: Avatar. The arena and script: Gladiator and The Running Man with a hint of Truman Show. - Story development and dialogue: The Last Airbender (the shameless failure by M. Nigh Shyamalan)

This is actually my first review here. I just have to say something about this movie. I was really excited to see it, because it sounded like such a good story and I've been hearing people talk about it all the time.

First of all, I was bored to DEATH during this movie. The scenes seemed so long sometimes and everything in this movie sort of got me annoyed. Poor characters, lame and cheesy lines, stupid teenager love story - that I could not believe until the end because I thought she liked the other guy back in her town whatsoever - the cast was well- was mediocre, battle scenes blurred, background of the plot was not explained properly(I did not read the books). I only caught a glimpse at why it's actually called 'hunger games'; however no one seemed to starve  EVER.

I was looking forward to the battle scenes but they made them so quick and blurry and f*** up (sorry), that even those were boring and annoying. Also annoying: the 'hero' does not even make use of her 'strength' the bow thing but instead hides in trees and only kills people when she absolutely needs to - of course. It's a teenage movie and why should she kills someone? You don't kill people, kids - even if your life depends on it.

I'm rambling because I am still so upset that I paid 10 euro to see this crappy movie. I enjoyed absolutely nothing about this movie and I don't understand why other people like it so much.

So: do not go see this movie, if you haven't already. It's a waste of time.

I was looking forward to this movie for months and have read through the books going on 3 times. The movie started out decent enough and it looked promising. First problem I had was that hunger did not seem be a huge issue, the characters seemed so pleasant not starving. Now I knew that Madge was not going to be in the movie but there were some details that went with her story that really would've helped explain and put more emotion into the story. Oh well I could have dealt with that but it all started getting shaky when they got on the train. The first scene in the train did not happen in the book.Then The train ride was OK. Not exactly how I imagined but I'm still hoping it will start to get going. Well Haymitch all the sudden sobers up and gets responsible and starts being nice to Katniss. Um... Did I miss something because I read in the book that Haymitch was always sloppy drunk and used sarcasm to communicate with Katniss because that how she operated. She and Haymitch had unspoken understandings later on in the arena (which BTW are sent with a little note instead of her thoughts). The "fire" if that's what you even want to call it, that was suppose to engulf Katniss' wardrobe was the lamest excuse for fire I have ever seen. It looked like a cheap production trick. Let me just take a moment and say I cannot believe they spent 100 million dollars on this because they don't have anything to show for it.

Anyways, my next HUGE issue with this movie was that the characters weren't developed at all! I felt no connection to any of them at all and I wasn't pulling for anyone the entire time. The movie didn't suck me into a futuristic society that was so bent on keeping control over all the districts that they produced a hunger games for entertainment. It didn't show me how destitute and hungry the inhabitants were, it didn't show the true horror of the games. It was like reading the inside flap of a book. I felt like I was watching a true kid's version of this story and that does not do it justice! On the games, the Cornucopia was the dumbest thing I've ever seen and what was with all the suit case looking items??? Stuff was supposed to be hanging off the Cornucopia not in a huge neat pile in front of it. Katniss does not get splattered with the blood of a boy tribute for the backpack but Clove chases her and she runs into Foxface (not in book). Katniss in the arena lasted all of like 20 minutes. There was not true terror about it all .. there was no desperation.. no near-death experience for Katniss. No folks, she doesn't get dehydrated in the movie.Oh when Katniss gets burned she throws herself into the lake and here come Cato an the careers and they are like "look there she is! let's get her! Yeah!let's get her!" It was like watching bullies at school not kids trying to kill each other. You know if the subject matter is too adult for kids make rated "R" don't water down such an awesome story! If they had to be so politically correct as to not offend anyone on the subject matter why even bother making a movie.

When Cato and careers see smoke they leave a kid behind (doesn't happen in the book) Foxface somehow sneaks directly behind him and stills food without him knowing. Katniss blows up supplies does NOT lose her hearing or have a bloody ear. Cato just puts his hands on the kids face and twists it sounds cool it wasn't.

Rue initiates the alliance in the movie. They spend like 5 seconds getting to know each other and then Rue's death (which Katniss proceeds to get her out of the net before she has a spear thrown into her)then Katniss cries uncontrollably for like 10 minutes.

Peeta did not get blood poisoning. He barely was scratched. His medicine was a cream not a syringe. Katniss did not pass out with her injury she "shared" Peeta's cream. UGH. typing this makes me sick. The cave scene lasted all of 2 seconds.

Muttations aren't anything like the book describes they looked like over-sized dogs. Peeta doesn't hobble the Cornucopia cause his leg is all better. Cato is already on it when they get there and they fight on top.. Cato talks nonstop for 5 minutes katniss finally shoots. Then 2 seconds later she shoots an arrow and kills him so much for listening to him all night. Yes this is gruesome stuff yes it is horrible but horrible things happen every day and we publicize them! Don't tell me we can't make a movie and not put violence in it.It's so much more than kids killing kids yes this is awful but it's about the capitol and its control over the people and the dictatorship.

I do not recommend this movie just re-read the books instead of going to the theater and wasting your money which BTW is all the producers of this movie wanted they made no real effort to make this a true adaption from book to film . I wish Jerry Bruckheimer or James Cameron could have gotten a hold of this title. I hope someone will re-make it somewhere down the road and have the guts to make it as real as it was in the books.

It's a shame how one aspect can spoil the entire experience but that's what happened for me. Other reviewers have commented on the use of hand-held shaky-cam, fast-cut camera-work - none of them positively that I can find.

From the Trivia section on IMDb we read this one sentence:

---- The director has stated that his decision to go with shaky cam work, "had a lot to do with the urgency of what's going on and to reflect protagonist Katniss Everdeen's point of view." ----

There was nothing "urgent" about the first 2/3rds of the film. I'm glad I don't go around throwing my head from side-to-side in normal life, stressed or not. When are film-makers going to realise they are the only ones that truly like this type of camera-work? They sit there editing the film on their desktop monitors in an office but faithful movie-goers have to watch their "creativity" on 50ft+ screens, where every sudden jerk sideways is at best distracting, at worst nauseating. It doesn't convey urgency, it conveys amateurism. Enough already.

Hitchcock asked the composer Friedhofer, "where would the orchestra be?" when the latter wanted a string piece for a scene in "Lifeboat" The composer replied "The same place as the cameraman." We expect movies to have a soundtrack, and if the music is working properly, then we don't really notice it because it joins in with the visuals and enhances the scene. We are viewers of make-believe, sometimes realistic, often fantastical, and immersion into the world of the story is key to a satisfying movie-going experience. A camera being wiggled about on purpose draws attention to itself, and it shouldn't. This constant reminder of the presence of a, seemingly badly trained cameraman, is a real turn-off. Please stop it.

As far as the other aspects of the film were concerned, I found the narrative somewhat plodding, and the pre-games section of the film could have done with being 20-30mins shorter. I knew nothing about the books beforehand, so I'm of the opinion that this is perhaps one for the S.Collins enthusiast rather than the general movie-goer. Though if the other reviews are anything to go by, plenty of Collins' readers are not very pleased either!

The movie is so bad I cannot even decide what to pick to begin with. Everything was wrong in it. Possibly one thing was good in the movie - that it finally ended. Although I heard they plan to make a whole franchise out of it. Back to the bad sides - the film is nonsense in every aspect - the very idea of holding people under control by forcing their kids to kill each other? What the...? The Capitol so rich and so big, yet all its residents being free people. Where are all servants, all people who provide services? In districts? But hey, someone needs to clean those streets or polish toilets. In the film only people seen in the Capitol are gay-like citizens and soldiers. Next, premise is set as if the film is a teen flick. Yet, it has quite disturbing idea behind - teens killing each other in picturesque fashion. Another thing - couple of kids teaming up to kill other kids, while there could be only one winner (putting aside slight change just before the end with 2 possible winners). Also, acting of young actors is wooden as hell. Last thing that comes to my mind - advancement of the Capitol is sick - cameras in every tree and creating(?) beasts and whatnot with some fancy interfaces in headquarters...What the...? Where are boundaries of their capabilities? And yet they have mines... for coal? Really guys, I wish I hadn't spent my money for this crap.

Many have drawn a comparison between "The hunger games" and Japanese cult movie "Battle Royale". There are obviously similarities, but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG, if you observe closely enough, the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the "game". They are not lily-white innocent, not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside, the more gory part of the killing is shown only once, at the beginning of the game, through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized (by an instructor to the protagonists) is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics  30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure, paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.

Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules, 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two "tributes" annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultra-modern, high-tech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter (about an hour) first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. 

The much contested lead role, by three Oscar-nominated young ladies, finally went to Jennifer Lawrence ("Winter bones") who edged Hailee Steinfeld ("True grit") and Shailene Woodley ("The descendants"), which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two's were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead (which is really a supporting role) is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from "The kids are alright" (2010). Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricature-like roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones. Donald Sutherland's appearance is more like a cameo.

"The Hunger Games" is good entertainment, with a reasonably engaging story. Recommended.

Where do we start...the first 60 minutes are spent on watching a bunch of teenagers being selected for the "games". I cannot tell you many details, because i got so bored and partly annoyed after only ~15 minutes that i started playing a game while... watching.

Bored by the meaningless dialogues, uninteresting characters (often in laughable costumes), and a story floating right in the air.

Annoyed by the camera work (i could probably do a better job shooting some pictures), and just the overall atmosphere that suggests a game where teenagers will be killed is a truly glorious event, like a snob party. Hey, i wouldn't mind some nice hunting and splatter, but they could at least try giving it a deeper meaning like Battle Royale did.

So...after those 60 minutes are finally over, the action is supposed to start. Right into a nice landscape we go, and while i didn't think the camera could get any worse..it instantly did. Everything felt blurred and bizarre.

It was impossible for me to feel any emotions, while the first teenagers got killed without *any* introduction. Oh the irony of wasting 60 minutes of our life, and then not putting any effort into a somewhat interesting start of the games.

At this point i turned off this movie, couldn't take it anymore and i watched a lot of crap.

1/10 

What's wrong with places like IMDb or rotten tomatoes these days, i cannot tell you. I just know this movie sucks balls, and should never be any higher than 4.0

In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.

The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured "Willy Wonka" style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.

Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those "playing" the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and "fun" for the viewers.

The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where - in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their "Blood and Circuses" - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.

The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing - whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)

Not comparing this to Battle Royale is impossible - the premise is too similar to be ignored. I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.

As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.

TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse.

I want those 2 and a half hours back. I don't have words to describe quite how hard this movie sucks but I will try. Always best to start with a positive though so I will say this movie is probably twice as good as Twilight :) Now for the bad: 

1) This movie is paper-light in terms of plot. Dystopian futures centred around class struggles have been done to death. They are not weighty backdrops with which to lend your stories depth.

2) I really couldn't care less about the characters. About an hour in I wished they had all died.

3) The socio-economic backdrop aside, the futuristic vision this film conveys is boring. Maybe that was the point and I am missing it.

4) The premise is ridiculous and clearly Battle Royale and The Running Man had an ugly love child. I understand this film was based off a book series - I didn't know this before watching but even still after nearly 3 hours of my attention if you can't convey the alleged gravitas and merits of this story I am unlikely to be impressed with a deeper literary exploration of this shamelessly exploitative money-grab.

5) Did I mention the plot was paper thin? 

6)Any chance of something remotely interesting or 'edgy' in terms of the dynamics of the unlucky lot thrust into the grips of mortal combat was looked over in favour of the mainstream, pleasing approach. I can only imagine this was for reasons alluded to in point 4.

7) The attempted conveyance of a romance in this film was plain ridiculous especially after this lengthy scene was played out straight after the equally ridiculous tragedy of the main characters little friend having just died.

8) Maybe I fell asleep at times but I am pretty sure the only person to have benefited from a 'sponsors drop' was the main girl. I found this odd as much was made of this little rule in the build up and I was led to believe that sponsors would have 'favourites'. Seems they all loved her and hated everyone else.

9) Related to above... Clearly any half decent sponsor would have air dropped a ladder in to the group trying to get her out of a tree.

10) Even as an action film, this flick is nauseating. The 'set piece' fight at the end is lamentable and even then is tinged with the nasty soiling of poorly thought out emotional drivel.

11) Having watched this film not more than an hour ago and having had it rob over 2 hours of my life I think it is still telling that I cannot remember the main characters names. 

Anyways, I will stop bashing this film now. Suffice to say I hated it. It's terrible - avoid it if you value half decent cinema. Avoid it if you are just after some cheap action thrills. By all means go watch if you need to test your threshold for boredom, cheesiness or sanity.

First of, there is no option here to give ZERO rating, so I am going with 1/10. I generally have a look at the rating at IMDb and go to the movie. Seeing a rating of 9/10, I was convinced that this will be a movie to remember forever - likes of Harry Potter & LOTR franchises. I got what I expected for all the wrong the reason. 

I am a avid reader of books, but I didn't read the Hunger Games by Suzzanne Collins. May be the book is something else. 

The movie title is Hunger Games, but there is no hunger shown nor there is any games shown. 24 kids are picked for 12 districts in festival of 'games' where the contestants kill each other. 

Then the contestants go through a ritual of showing off their skills to get 'sponsorship'. Sponsorship means they could get help in the games. 

After nearly one hour of going nowhere with the story, the games starts. A bunch of contestants get killed in first 10 seconds. Every 10 minutes, another contestant gets killed. But this is a PG-13 movie isn't it, so the director is sensitive enough to not show any killings, instead indicating the contestant is dead by a loud bang and a holograph projector shows their picture in the sky. Dumb you think ?, read on...And by the evening, all the bad bullies of the remaining districts form a 'Alliance' and start hunting one particular girl-the heroin of this movie - WHY? I am sorry, I do not know. Read on...They find the girl quickly. The girl climbs a tree, but the bullies can neither climb the tree nor shoot a arrow or throw a knife. What do they do ?. they wait for the girl to climb down. Why don't they simply make a fire and burn the tree ? Well, I a not the writer nor the director....

Point I am making is, this movie is SO DUMB, SO BORING. This is a 'B- GRADE' movie taken at huge expense, turning a R rated story into cheesy Teenage flick - but failing miserably in the attempt. 

By the time the movie ended, after 2hours 20 min, I was the first one out of the cinema hall, hoping for peace of mind.
