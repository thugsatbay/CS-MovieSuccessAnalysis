### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.

MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa will feel like too short of a movie, but that's also something that I can appreciate because I don't think it has any intention of trying to be all Oscar worthy, it's nothing more than telling a light, enjoyable story with good moral value lesson and that's about it. If the running time were any longer, it would lose some of its target audience. Hands down, without dragging this review any more than it has to, the best part of this movie once again, are the penguins! Those dudes are hardcore gangsters and freakin' hilarious! They should have their own spin-off, stand-alone movie, just about them scheming something deviant and mission impossible-esquire. I could watch them work together and hear their smartass, cocky remarks/attitude about a thousand more times and they'll still crack me up. If you find no reason to watch this movie, then at least watch it to check out those awesome penguins.

Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are back in their animated animal roles which 3 years ago saw their zoo animals being transported to Madagascar in a typical fish out of water tale, where they had to rely on their street smarts and friendship to survive in an environment they do not fully understand. While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!

Beginning directly where we last saw Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Smith), the penguins have finally built a plane that ought to bring our merry crew back to New York, together with Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his sidekick (Cedric the Entertainer), but of course should that happen, there'll be no sequel to begin with. So we have the crew crash land into the continent Africa, thereby guaranteeing yet another tale of being from the outside, but now having a habitat that's much closer to their natural environment, one which sees the animal types in question grouped together into one reserve for storytelling convenience.

Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, who also provided the voice of Skipper the head penguin, the storyline might seem like a poor man's cousin to Disney's The Lion King, what with exiles and alpha-lions battling it out to be king of the habitat. The filmmakers had taken the opportunity to craft the backstory for Alex a little more, so that the main plot of his return to his home could be dwelled upon, with sub plots for the others to fall into place. You have Alex's return and reunion with his parents, with adversary coming from an earlier generation, there's Marty who discovers that he's no longer unique but the same as every other hundredth zebra out there, Glora looking for love with other hippos now that there's no lack of suitors, and Melman fighting his own cowardice to reveal his feelings for Gloria, as well as being appointed the witch doctor for the land.

And if you think that the primary voice cast is already A-list, the film piles on to that list with the likes of the late Bernie Mac voicing Zuba the alpha-lion, Alec Baldwin again in a villainous role as his rival Makunga, and Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas in a hilarious role of hippo-Casanova Moto Moto (the name's so good you have to say it twice!) The songs department falls up a bit short this time round, though thankfully "Move It!" wasn't conveniently and lazily played ad-nauseam. Given the army of illustrators working on the project, you can't expect quality to drop from its predecessor, though there's nothing new to be injected into a mature presentation.

Despite the plundering of the same old family values / theme / storyline and the importance of establishing strong friendships, this new Madagascar managed to deliver on multiple fronts, joining the ranks of the few whose sequels are superior than the original. The comedy which got piled up here managed to work through the punchlines, leading to a number of characters like the monkeys and even the tough-cookie granny to steal some limelight from the lovable penguins. If you liked the original, then you'e likely to fall in love with this one.

I thought that the first Madagascar had promising characters and a decent premise, but it was very poorly put together. My son, who was 8 or 9 at the time loved the movie, however. We saw the sequel this morning and we both agreed - it was much better than the original. And, since part II begins with a brief summary of part I, there is no need to see the first one to understand what's happening in the new movie. All the main characters are back and there are many new ones as well. Going in, the big question on my mind was "do the penguins play a bigger role in the sequel?"... answer is "Yes, but not much bigger". All in all an enjoyable movie that outshines it's predecessor!

As with the comment ahead of mine: it's all about the penguins. They should have their own movie.

We were chanting: more penguins, more penguins. At the screening we just saw, people who loved the first Madagascar movie waited excitedly for the magic to begin... I LOVED the first one. Interesting note: I liked the first one better, but my BF thinks this one has a better and deeper plot and pointed out in particular that while in the first one Gloria (the hippo) was the butt of many fat jokes, in this one she is celebrated just for being beautiful.

The whole movie is breathtakingly beautiful. We didn't see this on IMAX but I bet the IMAX version will be a treat.

Sascha Baron Cohen's King is again the hands-down favorite, I heard a ripple of joy murmur through the theater at everything he said and did, although my personal favorites (after the Penguins) are Maurice and Mort, the King's cohorts.

BF was also teasing me mercilessly because (and I'm nearly ashamed to admit it) there's one scene that had me totally teared up! Yes, I cried. Can't spoil it - go see the movie and tell me after if you know what choked me up! The film did not hold the attention of some of the very small children at the screening we saw, because some portions of the film only involve adult storyline concerning the adult star characters (Alec Baldwin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and so forth) but when the little characters are on screen (the baby lion in particular is DARLING) the children present were absolutely captivated.

It's fun. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's very fun and children will want to watch it again and again.

The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them allbehind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.

In the second installment, you see the writers trying to give the franchise a dosage of heart and sentimentality, which is what made Shrek the instant classic it became. A bit of heart can definitely propel an animated movie into masterpiece status (see Toy Story and Finding Nemo) however this is not the franchise to do it. Madagascar is about the cast and how they interact with each other and the conflict that is presented onto them. While the laughs are definitely here, the attempt for emotion constantly makes this film slows down and keeps it from being a superior installment when placed against the original. That being said, it's still a fun, entertaining, and unpredictable movie that continues the zaniness that made the original a personal guilty pleasure of mine.

In Escape 2 Africa, we follow the New York zoo animals, the psychotic penguins, the monkeys, and the lemur leaders as they unexpectedly are stranded in the middle of Africa. While at first the main four (Marty, Alex, Melman, Gloria) are rather happy at their new environment, they quickly realize that it's not all that it seems, and that their new temporary home is splitting the four apart. In the meantime, the penguins attempt to repair the plane that they accidentally destroyed. The writers did a good job in presenting all sorts of new gags and yet again refrain from referencing pop culture too much (although the Twilight Zone nod was hilarious). But, they couldn't deliver the emotional impact because of one main reason: this franchise wasn't meant to ever slow down in terms of pacing. Like a roller coaster, this movie moves sometimes extremely fast, and then can grind into a halt in the next scene. Lastly the main four don't interact much with each other, but more with the environment. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at oncesome of them are good, some of them aren't.

The voice acting remains decent, but there are fewer lines by the original cast, and more from supporting characters and new characters. Bernie Mac, rest in peace, but his performance was rather bland and could have been done by anyone else. Alec Baldwin didn't have much of a chance to lend his comedic skills either. Yet again, the penguins and Sacha Baron Cohen steal every scene they are in, no matter how mediocre the previous scene was. Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Ben Stiller had fewer chances at being funny, as they had to handle all the major slower moments. Chris Rock's role was surprisingly limited, especially for someone who did so well in the original.

The one major improvement from the original was the animation, which was crisp, fluid, and flowed better. Surely it's undeniably no Wall-E (Or even 2007's Ratatouille), but it's still respectably an improvement over previous work. The jokes themselves are hit-and-miss like the original; the only difference is this one has more misses. Plus it's the recurring jokes that are missing; the hula girl, feisty tourist, repetitive herd, and lion-dancing bits all didn't elicit much laughter from the audience, nor from me. We just needed much more Julien, and much more penguin-action. Maybe in the future the focus will shift; in the meantime they are just grabbing all the spotlight and attention.

Bottom Line: Exactly what Scrat did to Ice Age: The Meltdown years ago, we have minor/supporting characters becoming the main hit and running the show. While the original four characters take a backseat and add emotion to a franchise that's too fast-paced for this sort of stuff, we have the penguins and Julien taking over the movie and keeping it from being another totally disappointing animated sequel like every straight-to-video Disney sequel, the ugly Shrek sequels, or Ice Age 2. The entertainment level is still magnificent the second time around, but it won't age as well as the first Madagascar did. Leave the heart to Pixar, because those folks have nailed it perfectly for years. Dreamworks can serve as the escapist cinema in terms of animation, but if they continue imitating and try to outdo Pixar, it will just dampen the quality of all their movies. Madagascar 2 is the prime example of this: purely fun and entertaining until it tries to distribute family values. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is also proof that those hilarious penguins need their own movie, pretty much immediately.

Yes, right now.

I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.

Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.

Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.

This movie really will give you a good laugh. It is about a new adventure of the four friends: Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo. On the trip back to New York, they had an air crash and came to Africa instead. There, they found their roots and also came across some difficulties. In this movie, there are many supporting roles. And among them, the four little penguins played an important part and even covered the other main roles for their genius and humor. From the very beginning, the four penguins spoofed the DreamWorks icon. As for their popularity, the DreamWorks even planned to make a film about the Madagascar Penguins. I'm really looking forward to it. In this movie, the film makers pictured us an amazing Africa with wild animals and beautiful landscapes. The visual effects are pretty good and impressing. And I like the theme song "Move It", really making me full of energy and feel the desire of dancing with the characters. The last scene when Marty said that "Love has no boundary", I can't agree more. And I think that this does not only apply to love between lovers but also apply to love between friends and family. All in all, this is quite a funny movie and worth watching.

I was really excited about seeing the sequel to Madagascar, because I really loved the first and thought it was one of the best animations of the decade, regardless of how underrated it is, and this looked just as good, and in my opinion it almost was. Both of them are excellent films that are nothing but fun and are super energetic from the moment they come on screen, and this just made me appreciate the first even more than I already did, and am even looking forward to a third installment. The quality of this film might seem more fast paced and careless, but it is just as lovable. 

When it started up, I was immediately sucked in, and I never became uninterested and it never stopped entertaining, because they did an excellent job at keeping your attention just like the first. There were some parts in the movie where I felt as if they tried too hard to please the audience and then others it got a little dumb and boring, but overall I laughed insanely and was very pleased. When it was over I wanted to watch it again. It's a great sequel to a great movie and I enjoyed watching it as much as the first, as I have said. Some hilarious scenes like the plane crash, any scene with Moto Moto and of course Mort are lovable too. It's story is touching and fantastic as well, go see it.

Just saw this at a discount movie theater ($2.50 a seat) and that's about what it's worth. Don't watch it expecting some major innovative work of art - it isn't, nor was it meant to be. It's purely fun fluff.

Without a doubt, the penguins steal the show. Their banter and antics are just downright hysterical. Granny on the other hand, needs to be retired. A cameo of her might have been funny, but she is overused to the point of irritation.

The ill-fated aircraft ride is a raucous ride, but after that the story splits into four or five (at least) concurrent sub-plots, so enough time isn't really given to each, and the pacing tends to jerk along in spurts. Basically it seems as if the filmmakers just strung together scenes of the funniest supporting characters from the original then tried to wrap it around a Lion King send-up.

All that said, I actually liked this one better than the original. Not every movie is intended to be a piece of ground-breaking cinematic artistry and this certainly isn't. But it IS just downright fun to watch. Now if Dreamworks would just give the penguins their OWN full-length picture...

Well, so far "Madagascar" is two-for-two in the laughs department. This is just as good, if not better, than the first film.

It's another good example of the "new" (last 10 years) kind of animated feature film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. In some cases, perhaps like this one, adults would laugh even more because many of the gags might over the kids' heads. I'm not talking sexual innuendos, just references to things older people could recognize.

It isn't just the writing that is excellent; the artwork is spectacular, especially on Blu-Ray. The colors and the detail are just amazing! More than once, my jaw dropped at what I was seeing on the TV screen. Like the first Madagascar, the high-def images are truly spectacular.

The combination of humor, drama, family and friendship ties and romance all make this a wonderful animated movie and the 90 minutes zip by.

I loved the original film as much as anyone else. It had a flawed story, a shorter time length, and a script that contained some humorous parts, but only some parts that were too predictable; but I loved it for it's charming characters and it's beautiful animation. So, when I saw that Dreamworks made this sequel to that film, I was only expecting this to be as good as the first, but sadly, I missed my only chance to see it in theaters of that year.

Almost two years later, however, on my last birthday, I had the chance to get this on a DVD copy, feeling very desperate to watch it to see if it would whether or not be surprise me as much as the original even though that film had it's problems. Later, I became a bit surprised. OK, it's not as excellent as the previous film that came out the same year "Kung Fu Panda", but it's not one of Dreamworks' weakest (that goes to Shark Tale, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, and Bee Movie). The same characters are as charming as ever, but this time, they're much fleshed out especially King Julian and Maurice.

Some of the new characters are great and I think the villain named Makunga voiced by Alec Baldwin isn't that bad of a villain, though he was underused and I liked Alex's parents as well. It's sad to see that Bernie Mac died just before this film was released (may his soul rest in peace), but I'm getting ahead of myself. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer has improved a little in this film although it does have some generic bits. It does have some clever references which works for the comedy that got a chuckle/laugh out of me as well as it's witty and sharp dialog. There was also a scene that involved a relationship between Gloria and Melman which was so romantic and sweet to watch.

The only two problems that I do have with this film is that while the story does have more heart than the original film, it's still predictable and does have it's similarities to the Lion King and Happy Feet and several scenes were dragged a lot throughout the movie. Aside from that, I said to myself, "This is a great sequel." I loved the original, but as a fan, this completely surprised and surpasses it as a much better entry of the franchise. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa isn't an excellent film, but I totally recommend this to those who haven't seen it or the original film yet. It is that good!

The first Madagascar was a colourful and above average animated movie. I saw its sequel last night for the first time, not sure not to expect, and I was surprised. It actually lives up to the first pretty much (and almost surpasses it), it isn't as zany in terms of humour to its original despite some very clever references, but it has more heart than the first film did. Of course the plot is very predictable and I did notice one or two similarities with the Lion King, and probably slower than pace. But it is well the watch, for a number of reasons. The animation was beautiful and very colourful, even more so than the original. The characters are still great, the penguins were great fun, but Julien was absolutely hilarious here. The voice actors bring a lot of vigour into the film, Jada Pinkett Smith has more to do here, Ben Stiller and Chris Rock provide great comedy and heart and Sacha Baron Cohen is a hoot as Julien. Plus there is a sweet romantic interlude between Melman and Gloria. All in all, a fun sequel that lives up to the first. 7/10 Bethany Cox

I am not a big fan of cartoons but a friend forced me to watch this. I use IMDb as a true barometer to judge films and so was a little disappointed to see a below average rating for Madagascar 2. I will give it a 9/10. 

It had everything that a cartoon movie could ask for - animals with crazy human-looking faces, hilarious dialogues, simple story and finally some extra ordinary animation. The story is simple enough for every age group to be involved. I was particularly impressed with the reasoning behind the water problem in the jungle.

Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer's voices deserve special mention.

I haven't seen Madagascar 1 but my friend told me that this is a worthy and better sequel. Go for it!!!

Thank God the sequel to 2005's "Madagascar" turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.

It starts where Madagascar One ended: Central Park Zoo animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) find themselves still stranded and eager to leave the island. The penguins have built a plane and successfully take off for NY when they crash land in the African wilderness. The NY Zoo animals try to fit in with their wild counterparts and encounter situations that challenge their friendship.

Of course King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), the surprisingly scene-stealing granny and the rest of the supporting cast provide added hilarity and wit to almost every repartee. Even more welcome was the relevant uplifting theme, which served as an effective sub-plot, an important message delivered in a fun, non-preachy way. If they intend to rollout a Part Three, this would be a tough one to beat!

In one of the DVD extras Ben Stiller comments that they wanted to make this second Madagascar movie better than the first, and from my vantage point they did it. There was more going on, the story was more interesting, and the dialog was more clever.

This movie actually opens with a short scene to show how, many years earlier, the New York lion Alex was captured as a cub and how he ended up in the zoo, followed by his and the other animals' escape that resulted in becoming stranded on Madagascar.

After that suitably short flashback, the movie picks up where the first one left off. The band of Penguins have made their way to Madagascar and they, along with the locals, are working diligently to restore a long-lost crashed plane to flight worthiness. The images and dialog are so inventive and interesting. When they finally get airborne, headed back to New York, it is clear to us they will never make it.

In yet another inventive and funny sequence, the plane ends up crash-landing in Africa, coincidentally the same region where Alex had been born and where his father and mother still lived, peacefully along with all the other animals. So the main of this movie involves how the group from Madagascar integrate into the existing African animal dynamics, and how they must cooperate to save the animals from an unexpected drought. Very inventive, very interesting and entertaining movie.

Ben Stiller is back as the voice of Alex the lion. As are Chris Rock as Marty the Zebra, David Schwimmer as Melman the giraffe, Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria the Hippo, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the little animal Julien.

New actors include (deceased) Bernie Mac who does a great job as Zuba, the father of Alex. And Alec Baldwin as Makunga, the lion who covets Zuba's leadership, and who is always trying to make trouble for Zuba.

Of all the computer animated films from Dreamworks so far, 'Madagascar' is the one that most warranted a sequel (in terms of story, if not quality). Firstly, our protagonists were still stuck in Madagascar at the end, and secondly, the foosa problem hadn't been solved in any sort of permanent way.

So anyway, 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' kicks off with the New Yorkers fixing the crashed plane we saw in the first film with the intention of flying back to New York, and the word 'foosa' isn't even mentioned.

Oh, well. I guess one out of two isn't so bad.

What was strange, however, was that once in Africa (what, you didn't think they'd actually get to New York, did you?) we find that the lions that live there in the wild (or at least in the wildlife reserve) are actually pretty civilised. This is strange because, if I recall, we spent the last half of the first film seeing Alex trying to suppress his wild side because it made him turn vicious and bite Marty on the butt and stuff.

I mean, surely all the lions living in the wild would be, well, wild? But they're not. So are we to therefore assume that Alex is the exception? That he's some sort of demon-possessed leonine psychopath? Not that it's really important. I mean, sure, it ruins the continuity and all, but if you're after continuity and coherency in the story then you really shouldn't be watching 'Madagascar' in the first place.

Either of them.

So what should you watch it for? Why, the comedy of course! It's very slapstick and doesn't for a second try to be cute or tasteful, appealing directly to the 13-year-old in us all.

The characters are another reason, with all the ones you'd expect to be back from the original returning. This, along with a number of new ones, did make for a rather crowded film, but it just about managed it IMO.

I should also make special mention of the music. The collaboration between Hans Zimmer and Will.i.am is a good one, with some great songs and tunes that are well worth sitting through the credits for.

Overall, I bear no hesitation in saying that 'Escape 2 Africa' is better than its predecessor. It doesn't try too hard, the jokes are better executed, the plot makes slightly more sense, the music is great and Makunga wins paws down in the fabulous mane department.

In the end, I felt that 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' wasn't even made for kids. That's not to say that it's unsuitable, and I'm sure that kids will like it, but this looks to me like a film that the folks at Dreamworks made for themselves. And really, that's the only way you can go about making a good film.

This movie was so much better than the previous one! We went to see this one for my 25th birthday because we were in the mood for some light-hearted entertainment and we really hit the jackpot choosing this movie! Madagascar 2 is simply hilarious: the crazy and extremely violent granny, Moto Moto being too macho for words, the crazy king, the hippo lady being in the mood for some love, the love sorrow of the hypochondriac giraffe (whose voice is being done by ever funny David Schwimmer from friends) and the extremely smooth mafia penguins... This is just a great movie for young and old. I'm waiting for this one to come out so I can buy it. The least funny character according to me was the lion, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Ben Stiller's comic talents. If you're in the mood for a hell of ride, I advise you to go and see this one. You won't stop laughing from the beginning till the end.

If you expect Madagascar 2 to be as mild mannered as the prequel then you will be very disappointed. If you think that you wouldn't mind jokes about an old granny being beat up in front of your kids, and you liked the first Madagascar, then you will probably like the sequel. The PG rating is 100% required as on the way home we had to explain to our 7-year-old son, it is never acceptable to beat up an old lady no matter how annoying they are (warning: some scenes were shocking and violently graphic for impressionable or young kids!) The first Madagascar is much more appropriate for children, hence its U rating. To make matters worse, the irritating King Julian is, unfortunately, back in abundance. There were some mildly amusing moments - for example the reference to The Twilight Zone when Mort was on the wing - and some of the slap-stick wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, many of the gags were quite predictable e.g. the one involving Marti, zebras and spit! Comments were quite negative as we walked out of the cinema with one guy saying that he fell asleep part of the way through! At one point my wife was so despondent she wanted to walk out of the cinema, however having paid the money we felt obliged to sit through it. The plot was a bit like 'Lion King' on drugs and didn't seem to flow that well! It's certainly not a wow factor film, most intelligent adults and kids would find better entertainment watching a fish tank! You might just about manage to keep the kids in their seats with this film but don't listen to the advertising hype because it's nothing to write home about!

For those looking for a sunny escape as the weather grows more bitter this fall season, I have some backhandedly cheerful news. The good new is: That Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (cringes at title) is actually significantly better then the hackneyed and infinitely disappointing original. The catch: It is still not quite good enough. Let me first say however that I am not expecting this review to be read and adhered to by young children, but rather is directed towards the public as a whole. Thusly, I would imagine, in fact I am almost certain, that young children will adore this film. But even myself being a huge fan of animated films, I will give tentative praise to Madagascar 2, when addressing those of an older demographic.

The original Madagascar was a hodge podge of childish slapstick, inside jokes strung together with a meandering narrative, speckled with characters voiced by nondescript bland voice actors. While not all these follies have been rectified here, some have and others have been partially reconstructed and the result is a more touching and mature animated feature. The animation has also been ramped up, and despite having the same recognizable visual stamp, is far more vivid and textured. All the key players are back; Alex the dancing lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the bootylicious hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), Marty wise crackin' zebra (Chris Rock) and Melman the paranoid giraffe (David Schwimmer). As the troupe leaves Madagascar on the penguin refurbished plane, they are joined by King Julian (Sasha Baron Cohen), his aid Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and an obnoxious tagalong named Mort (Andy Richter). Arriving (dangerously) on mainland Africa, the New York natives find a land of wonder of endless savannah and collections of animalslike them. Among the natives is the lion king Zuba (voiced by the late Bernie Mac) who happens to be Alex's father. After a tearful reunion, danger looms as the watering hole suddenly dries up, and friendships are strained.

One of the most prominent recurring issues lies with the voice-work. Ben Stiller is bland, but when he does attempt to zest it up, it becomes readily apparent it is him. Gloria's character is unmemorable, as is that of her silent admirer Melman. David Schwimmer is funny because of both delivery and expression, but his skill is halved when doing voice-work, and leaves an awkward character. One thing I will raise compliment to, is the creator's choice to dial back Melman's germ-a-phobic tendencies and focus more on the character, but he is, alas, still someone of a downer in an Eeyore type way. Added to the cast is the scheming lion Makunga, voiced surprisingly banally by Stephen Baldwin who vies for Alex's father position at the head of the pride. Boasting the much needed spunk, is Rock as Marty, Mac as Zuba, Will I Am as a womanizing hippo named Motto-Motto and Cohen as King Julian who gets more screen time, and wastes ner' a second. And how could I not mention the penguins, which have not yet become gimmicky or annoying and add a lot of mature class to the story.

Overall however, Madagascar 2 bears an eerie resemblance to The Lion King, both in setting and characters, with the lost son, manipulative lion and wacky sidekicks. While not a deliberate rip-off, the comparison is unavoidable and only bears reminder of how superior that film is. There is also a disastrous subplot involving a stranded tour group led by an ill conceived and unboundedly obnoxious character called only "Nana". All in all, kids will be entertained, and adults never bored, but it is not great. Not even compared to other DreamWorks offering such as Kung Fu Panda. If your child needs to rush out and see this in theaters, then be sure to oblige, but no harm would be done in waiting for the DVD.

I generally love animated movies but the first Madagascar did nothing for me. This sequel was absolutely hilarious!! From start to end it will keep you entertained. I feel as though the sequel caters to an older audience as well as the kiddies, which makes it way more enjoyable. The king as well as the penguins just stole the show in my opinion and made the movie a lot more adult friendly. This is definitely one of my favourite movies of '09 so far. The comedy was spot on and story had a lot more heart than the first one. I wont spoil the movie but its definitely a must see and believe me.. the worst part is when the movie ends its that good!!! 10/10

Usually, when a film achieves remarkable financial success, the film industry arranges for space for one or two sequels. This is what happened with "Madagascar", but the sequel was able to maintain the initial level of quality. In this film, the attempt of the four zoo animals to return to the US fails and, by great coincidence (this only happens in the films), they end up falling in Central Africa, in the animal reserve where Alex was born, which allows him to know his parents and origins. The film is very good and fun, it retains most of the cast and voice actors of the original film and adds or recovers some characters, such as the Elder Lady, who gains some protagonism here, alongside Alex's parents. I also noticed that some characters who, in the initial movie, were secondary, were now approached for a more central space, a measure that was certainly the response to the affection they gained from the public. This is the case, for example, of King Julian. The four central characters do not change much, but the script tried to give them more space and attention to counterbalance the weight of several charismatic secondary characters. The script recaptures an old tradition of animated films and creates moments where it conveys moralistic messages, especially regarding the differences between individuals (the events between Melman and Gloria and Marty's dilemma with the other zebras are just two examples). Personally, I have nothing against this militancy implied in the film. Voice actors continue to perform flawlessly, as well as drawings, animations, and cinematography. Oddly enough, this movie is very poor in music or great songs. There are some, but none deserve particular attention.

IS MADAGASCAR 2: ESCAPE TO Africa ANY GOOD? Superior sequel finds our heroes fleeing Madagascar and reuniting with Alex's (Ben Stiller) family in Africa, where another lion threatens his family's claim to lead the pride. Meanwhile, Melman (David Schwimmer) struggles to confess his feelings to Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Marty tries to establish his own identity among scores of identical zebras. Loaded with hilarious non-sequiturs and inspired silliness.

IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa is rated PG. A large male hippo flirts with a female hippo; the camera focuses on his large buttocks and he says how he likes large females. There's plenty of slapstick violence.

ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES TO DISCUSS? We all have talents that can contribute to the good of all.

In "Madagascar", a hippo, a zebra, a giraffe and a lion from New York Central Park zoo were lost in an exotic location and the Lion into a big identity crisis. In "Madagascar 2" pretty much the same happens, only this time, the writers did their homework and provided enough development so the plot and the dozens of worthy subplots could fill in a one-hour-and-half format.

So, the more I watched "Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa", the more the first opus looked like a first draft, the thing you write and then realize it doesn't work and improvement is much needed. Madagascar was a fun place but the jungle was so dense it created a feeling of entrapment with an overdose of greens and browns. The lemurs and the fossa were fun and cool but apart from King Julian, Maurice and that little Gizmo-like creature Mort; they could hardly steal the show, not when you had the penguins anyway. The one thing I particularly loved in the film was the endearing friendship between Alex and his zebra friend Marty, so I was expecting the sequel to develop this aspect a little more.

Not only it did, but it also fixed all the problems the first film had. If the very setting of "Madagascar" couldn't work, the wild territories of the savanna did, which is not surprising since they had already proved to be a great vehicle for stories in a previous Disney movie. And while Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe were disposable sidekicks in the first, they were given the full individual development they were overdue by being confronted to their peers and to each other. In the first opus, the animals were straight characters discovering a weird universe, in the second one, they are straight characters meeting other straight ones, and the fun comes from the differences (or resemblances). And the sequel allows us to know more about Alex, who used to be Alakay, son of the local Mufasa: Zuba, voiced by the late Bernie Mac.

The film's beginning is familiar material, the cub is taken by hunters while his father tries to rescue him but Alakay ends up in New York City and becomes the main zoo attraction, while his new friends comment his tendency to be a show-off. This move has already proved to work for DreamWorks with "Shrek 2", in the sequel, we've got to know the back-story of the main characters as it makes the perfect connection with the first while being emotionally promising. And in a way, this could have been the first film, with the same premise, like a false start that is fixed now, I guess the writers said "gosh, where can't we put them, now? They've already been in Africa, I mean Madagascar is in Africa" And someone must have pointed out that it's not the way people visualize Africa. So how about "Madagascar" in "The Lion King" territories? 

So let's make a second start and take the best from the film, the original quartet, Alex' nemesis: the old lady, King Julian, Maurice and Mort, and who's gonna fly them to Africa? The penguins (remember the first film ended with the boat out of fuel, good continuity). And the plane sequence is much more hilarious than the boat ship where all the animals were locked in a box, the penguins play the pilots and hostesses' part, King Julian is in the first class talking politics while Alex and Marty discuss some triviality. And the 'landing' was of course more spectacular and it made Melmann confess his love to Gloria, and it doesn't even come as shock, there had to be something between them. So, the plane crashes and the penguins estimate the delay to six to nine weeks, and you better believe they get it right. They'll even use the chimps to repair the plane, because they have opposable thumbs (damn Darwin), but they're not superior mammals for nothing and they'll know how to raise their voice for their workers' rights.

So our friends discover Africa and when they admire the landscape, Alex has a feeling of déjà vu, probably remembering his childhood but it doesn't take a genius to know that this is a clever nod to Disney, and yeah, "Dreamworks" make a hilarious come-back to Africa with a story that is as entertaining and appealing; it's got love, fights, dancing, tribes' codes, and great character developments through many plots and subplots. Gloria meets the Alpha Hippo Moto-Moto, Melmann becomes the witch doctor and Marty questions his uniqueness after seeing all the zebra quickly learning his tricks. There's a gag involving their resemblance and they also have the same voice so that even Alex can tell his friend from the others. Everything was an improvement from the first and hell, they even improved the 'identity crisis'.

After an emotional reunion with his parents, Alex must face the fact that he can't make his tribe proud because he only knows how to dance, disappointing his father and causing him to abdicate because he doesn't have the heart to banish his son, so Makunga (a slicker Scar voiced by Alec Baldwin, but in reality a self-centered loser) becomes the king. But the real troubles start when the waterhole dries up, and maybe this is the time for Alex to prove his value, his own way. It's not the "remember who you are" but the "stay true to yourself" (I just love the way he keeps the hat of shame all the time) as if there was really a little gay subtext with the references to dance as an opposition to fight.

Watching "Madagascar 2", I thought of what I said about the first, it's like a long exposition and I can't wait to see the sequel. So, I saw it and I absolutely loved it.

This was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. When I see a Dreamworks film I expect a memorable, fun, crude, but a rather mediocre movie. This film was (very) memorable, fun, (very) crude but a high- quality movie.

So, the film starts off with giving you a bit of background on how Alex got to the zoo in New York and then goes to the present where the animals you got to know and love in the first film (Alex, Gloria, Marty, Melman, the penguins, King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the two monkeys) get ready to go to New York. Well, the end crash-landing in Africa and Alex meets his family and the others (outside of Julien and the penguins) find other animals of their kind. 

This film is charming like the original Madagascar. Alex meets his family and then he and his dad struggle to keep a good relationship. At the same time he struggles to keep friends with Marty. It's another film about struggling relationships. But, it's done in a rather fun and charming way.

This film is a bit more inappropriate (ok, check that, a lot more inappropriate) than the first film. This one the sexual innuendo and a little close to sex scenes dominate the film, some more suggestive language, and a few scenes of animals beating up an elderly woman.

Overall, it is definitely better, but more inappropriate than the first. Personally the absolute youngest age I'd allow a child to see it is 8. I give this film 8 stars out of 10.

Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The movie is a very fresh sequel to Madagascar that I think is just as good,in fact probably better,than the first one.Its filled with more interesting characters and each of the four main characters are given their own story,which I really liked.I liked seeing all four of them dealing with a new life in Africa,particularity Marty as we see him hanging around a ton of Zebras who look and sound exactly like him,I thought this was a funny set up and seeing how sensitive Marty was about being unique,it was a good choice.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first one will definitely enjoy. 

As they fly back to New York,the animals crash land in Africa,where Alex is reunited with his parents,although he must fight to prove he is worthy to stay.Meanwhile,we see the rest of the gang get use to a new life in Africa.
