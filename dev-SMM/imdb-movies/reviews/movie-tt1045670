### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Happy-Go-Lucky has been reviewed in the British press as a relatively lightweight Mike Leigh movie, but I'm not so sure. The story revolves around Sally Hawkins' remarkable performance as primary school teacher Poppy Cross, a highly unusual character in that Hawkins and Leigh between them manage to make her consistently cheerful and optimistic without being either naive or irritating. Poppy is presented as both relentlessly cheery and, on another level, remarkably intuitive; throughout the film, she has a series of encounters with troubled male figures (a boy in her class who has started bullying, a very strange homeless Irishman and, above all, her phenomenally uptight driving instructor Scott) and in all of them, Poppy's liveliness and friendly curiosity about other people is seen to be a powerful counter to male self-pity, anger and despair.

Hawkins' character is not someone who is inclined to let life get her down, so it's just as well that she is surrounded by people with a somewhat more sardonic or downbeat take on reality. Her flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman, very good) is a wonderfully dry and sarky counter to Poppy's enthusiasm, although the affection between them is palpable. Poppy's younger sisters Suzy and Helen are also quite different; Suzy is a law student who is more interested in clubbing, drinking and playing with her brother-in-law's Playstation than in criminal justice, while Helen is heavily pregnant, obsessed with acquiring the trappings of a respectable suburban life and unable to understand how her older sister can be so happy living in a rented flat and not stepping onto the property ladder.

The big surprise for me is that I had been led to believe that this is a more or less straightforward feelgood film. It isn't. Scott, Poppy's driving teacher (Eddie Marsan), is the most affecting character in it, and one of the greatest and most unforgettable characters in Leigh's oeuvre. Most of the reviews I've read of the film depict Scott as a hateful, sinister or otherwise despicable character, but although it's true that he is an uptight, judgmental, angry bigot, it is also perfectly clear from his first appearance that he doesn't know what he's talking about and that he is driven by emotional problems that he hasn't even begun to get a handle on. Marsan's extraordinary performance is one of the best things I've seen on film for a long time. Scott has been afflicted with very bad teeth and a mild speech defect (he can't really say the letter 'r') and although his inner anger and bigotry is played for laughs for a lot of the film, in the end it is allowed to blossom forth in a riveting scene where his fury, jealousy and terror of his own darkness spill forth in a heartbreaking and riveting torrent. If part of the point of art is to help us to understand people we would otherwise have little sympathy with, then this film is a work of art. I've never seen Marsan before but he deserves awards for this movie, no question.

Happy-Go-Lucky is a highly enjoyable and often very funny film, but it also carries terrible sadness. I have never been a massive fan of Mike Leigh, but lately I have to admit that I was wrong. He just seems to get better and better.

Having read some critiques to the extent that this was a film about a naive, childish woman who refused to take life seriously, I was hesitant whether I'd be able to bear this movie.

Luckily, it turned out to be one of the most entertaining cinema experiences since quite a long time.

Poppy isn't the person refusing to become an adult which her misanthropic driving instructor Scott accuses her to be. Our time indeed seems to bring about such people but they could hardly be more different than this lovely young woman. The first scene, with the girls drunk and chatting nonsense, is perhaps a bit misleading on this issue. (In fact, several people left the cinema during this scene, seemingly annoyed of all the giggling.) Rather, Poppy is wise and strong, trying to see the positive in everyone and everything. Humour, and sometimes benign derision, are her ways of keeping sulkiness out of her life. But, as everyone with a heart should feel, that is a gift, not a deficit. What damage can it cause to have a nice word or a smile for your fellow humans? On the other hand, she doesn't shut her eyes on the sad sides of life, such as a traumatized homeless man or a boy beaten by his mother's new partner, and one understands that she is deeply sad about not being able to help Scott, even if she would have had every reason to simply hate him for his bad temper, his racism and his stalking.

The director has done a superb job with this production; it is packed with intelligent, witty dialogs and convincingly drawn characters.

Our world needs a lot more people like Poppy, or at least -- if they don't possess her strength and optimism -- people who are sympathetic with her values instead of feeling threatened by humaneness. Yes, life is difficult and often sad, so let's tackle it with a smile!

Some UK critics have been saying that "Happy-Go-Lucky" is the happiest and most cheerful movie that Mike Leigh has ever made. Well, I don't know if I would exactly agree with that. It is and it isn't.

Sally Hawkins' primary school teacher Poppy is, indeed, a very happy individual. Annoyingly happy, insanely cheerful, depressingly optimistic and psychotically 'Up!', most of the time. It is a tribute to Sally Hawkins performance that, once you get past the initial irritation with her, you completely fall in love with Poppy, her goodness, her openness and, yes, her simple niceness.

Then there is Eddie Marsan's driving instructor Scott. Scott is the very antithesis of happy. Scott is rigid, angry, frustrated, impatient, knotted up and racist. A borderline OCD sufferer, who is tortured by who-knows-what in his past. Scott is the most bitter and overwhelming character in a Mike Leigh film since David Thewlis' Johnny in "Naked". It is a towering performance by Eddie Marsan.

If Poppy is the light, Scott is definitely the dark, but it seemed to me that dark shadows inhabit the whole of "Happy-Go-Lucky". The unhappy schoolboy, the glum Sister, the other sister - a social climber who dominates her husband. Little vignettes of irritation and annoyance. Typical Mike Leigh.

"Happy-Go-Lucky" is a really good film, if you stick with it. I liked the way that Poppy does stop smiling towards the end. Maybe the world is too much for even the most dedicated optimist?

Mike Leigh's done it again ... for fans and detractors alike! Poppy, his latest creation, sails through this slice of life with a smile on her face, fun on her mind and kindness in her heart.

Irritating? I didn't think so. On my good days, I rather hope there's a little of her in me.

For me, she was quite brilliantly brought to life by the excellent Sally Hawkins. Ironically, if she calls to mind any other inhabitant of Planet Leigh then it's probably Jane Horrocks's rather more sour Nic (or was it Nat?) in Life Is Sweet.

And Poppy has much to be happy about. A true friend, with whom she shares a not-too-shabby flat in a Finsbury Park that I shall not stoop to comparing with the N4 district of my own experience. A job she was born to do, among supportive colleagues. An enjoyable social life, memories of travels past, a cool reetro bike (for a while, at least ... ) and a wardrobe straight out of (ahem!) an Australian's nightmare all go to emphasise the message given by the film's title.

Into her life ambles driving instructor Scott, played by the ever-welcome Eddie Marsan, and the real fun begins. If Poppy can be said to stroll across the surface of life's duckpond without even getting the soles of her cowboy boots wet, then Scott is a man slowly drowning. The film's strongest plot line (this *is* Mike Leigh!) charts the evolving relationship between these apparent opposites,and the interplay really lights up the screen.

To say more would dent your enjoyment should you decide to go and see for yourself! If you go by bike, remember to lock up securely or - better still - maybe your best friend will take you along in her "mad" yellow car.

However you get there, why not let Poppy's attitude infect you for a few hours after you leave? It probably will anyway ...

Whenever I meet people who seem to be happy all the time I wonder if they are crazy or if they just know something I don't. While I don't get them I'm still fascinated by people like this, which is why I went to see this film.

I found this film to be disappointing. I read great reviews and from the trailer it looked like it would be lots of fun. While I thought Hawkins did a good job in the role, and in fact all the acting was good in my opinion I failed to see the point of the story. Yes, Poppy is always happy, giggly, and positive and feels it's her duty to brighten the days of others and allow them to see life from her point of view. This doesn't really seem to work very well, from the clerk in the book store to the homeless man, to her sister to Scott the belligerent driving instructor. All she seemed to do was irritate these people for being so insanely chipper and wanting to force her cheeriness onto others and fault them for not seeing life the same way. I found HER annoying in this respect.

I honestly felt if she DID have a real effect on those people and DID somehow brighten their lives by just being around then the story would have made more sense. I felt Poppy was genuinely kind, sweet, and childlike, however she WAS selfish, as Scott pointed out and did "have a real need to be adored". She was immature and disrespectful during all her lessons which angered Scott while feeling that she was just being happy and sweet. There are times for jokes and there are times to be a bit serious. If you're mocking another person and what they do don't expect them to be happy with you.

In the movie "Closer" Jude Law's character tells Clive Owens character that "everyone wants to be happy" to which Clive Owen's character responds "depressed people don't want to be happy. They WANT to be depressed". I kept thinking of that scene after leaving "happy go lucky". Poppy's view of life works for HER, but doesn't work for everyone, and is not everyones (or most people's) true nature. While someone who IS so happy might want to impart their wisdom onto others maybe these people don't want to be educted as to how to see things differently.

I have wasted 2 hours of my life watching this trite film. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is non existent, the script awful and the direction is lazy. 

The only reason I have given this film 2 stars is for the scene where Scott (played by Eddie Marsan) the driving instructor, pulls Poppy's hair...the very least he could've done, considering how bloomin' annoying she is. The other star was for Eddie Marsan's acting, although he was wasted in this drivel. 

As for the character of Poppy trying to make the world a 'happier' place: maybe she should try listening to people, instead of her constant snickering and mocking attitude. 

Words cannot express how much I loathed this film, but then, I've always hated people who say "cheer up, it may never happen". Next time someone says that to me I'll reply with: "it already has, I watched Happy-Go-Lucky".

I went to this movie against my better judgement, in the hope that Mike Leigh and his band of luvvies had managed to make something digestible for the general public. And in fact, I don't think this is a bad film, and I am not surprised at the favourable reviews.

But - and that's a big but - while many commentators say they went to this film expecting to be irritated by it, and ended up enjoying it, I found the reverse effect.

Poppy is a happy and optimistic person, uplifting to behold, but also incredibly naive. It is as if her happy personality is sufficient defence against the fact that she tips over the edge half the people around her.

I felt immense sympathy for Scott, played brilliantly by Eddie Marsan, who is one of those disturbed people - with a background and childhood we can only guess at - who are able, just, to live within society. But like a dripping tap, Poppy wilfully pushes him bit by bit, with no understanding of him at all, until he explodes. It's as if the bubble of happiness that she lives in is justification for the hurt she wreaks on others. Scott is not a likable character. But until he met this idiot woman, he was able to function without causing any harm.

Furthermore, Poppy goes into a dark building, again in her happy bubble, to be confronted by a tramp. I sat there thinking, "You stupid woman, why on earth did you go there?". Frankly, if she'd been beaten to a pulp, I would have cheered.

How can anyone dislike a movie like "Happy-Go-Lucky" without appearing to be a curmudgeon? I don't know, but I'll try. First, the main character's perpetual smiling and giggling at every question and obstacle she faces seems to be more the result of a socially inept nervousness than from having any understanding of the world. Second, the main character's approach to a problem with a bully in the class she teaches ends up appearing to have more to do with the physical attraction she has for the male social worker that comes to help than it does with the tragedy of the bully being physically abused at home. Third, the main character's run-in with a mentally ill homeless man on her way home one night seems to be more about satisfying her own superficial curiosity than it does her interest in learning anything about the human condition. And fourth, the main character's final encounter with her driving instructor seems more evident of her total lack of previous insight than it does her ability to be able to reach out to a tortured soul.

I guess what I disliked most about the movie is that these four key plot points appear to be put in the movie to try to make us believe the main character, Poppy, was not just a flighty party girl, but had some depth of spirit that we could emulate. I hope nobody emulates Poppy. Even though I think it is important to be happy in this world, it is more important to be happy for the right reasons. True happiness goes to the core of the soul. Poppy's happiness was as whimsical and deep as the clothes that she wore.

I gave it three points for some comedic charm.

Poppy is a 30 year-old school teacher who acts like smirky 14 year-old. Her non-stop comments are not particularly clever, & she has a smug attitude with most people she doesn't know. How is she "happy-go-lucky"? Director Mike Leigh doesn't know how to write characters. The unlucky actor who played the driving instructor had a tough job--Leigh has him be a racist,homophobe AND a religious nut-- written as a cartoon villain. And next to Poppy, he STILL came across as more worthy of the audience's sympathy. *Spoiler*--How dare she refuse to give him his own car keys,because she thinks he's too angry to drive--when she was nothing but flippant & uncaring during her driving lessons--she was too interested in her own snarky prattle than the road. This is an obnoxious movie, and worse--Leigh isn't talented or intelligent enough to realize he did everything wrong.

This movie consists of following a 30 year old female teacher around her life for a week or two. She gets a boyfriend, her friends are married, most are not, she gets on moderately well with her family, some members more than others. It could be anybody. 

And if that's all that it is, then this movie deserves a 3: it wouldn't show you something you didn't know, or make you think more about something you thought didn't need any more thinking about. It would just roll-by, its celluloid flicker stealing 90 minutes and £7 you could have spent on learning or doing, or making. 

Some critics have praised this movie simply because it's less relentlessly sad than others Leigh has shot. But failing to be sad doesn't, in fact, warrant a good review.

Some reviewers suggest that, through the gauzy veil that is Sally Hawkin's Poppy, Mike Leigh reveals basic truths. That is indeed what the movie has to stand and fall on: Does it allow us to see the world (or at least 'a world'), in the grain of sand, which is Poppy's week?

Unfortunately, these other reviewer's don't identify the truths that are supposedly revealed. 

That, I suggest, is because none are.

Leigh shows us a driving instructor who is angry and blames schools for being left-brained and society for being irresponsible and liberal...

In other words, he blames single, care-less Poppy for the state of his world. Is he perhaps right? This is, after all, the world in which Poppy is currently happy. 

Poppy bends her lip empathetically when her bike is stolen "didn't get a chance to say good bye". Theft doesn't matter then. Her sister suggests that a woman who at thirty has not had children or gotten married, or even a pension, might be in for a less-than-happy old age. 

This is a massive social change, perhaps one of two big changes of the century. The thought's worth considering, but Leigh doesn't reveal a truth about whether or how this might matter for Poppy or for culture. 

Poppy's sister is pretty anal and angry too. There's a pattern here: It seems that people being conventional in Poppy's carefree, childless, unattached world are going to be angry.

Poppy is of course attached in many ways - enter her inner London school where half the kids are born of foreign parents and the average skin colour would resemble cup of hot chocolate. But we don't see violence crime, and educational failure which are crippling these schools and their kids - just a nice white boy who rather gently whacks his black class-mate (because we learn, through Poppy's new boyfriend to be cum social worker, his mum's got a new boyfriend). 

Poppy's happy: And in Poppy's world, to disagree with Poppy or her friends is to risk having the police called - you're dangerous.

I just had to write this comment because I generally value the ratings given to movies here on IMDb for guiding my viewing, and making good use of my limited amount of movie watching time given an almost unlimited number of movies. Well it didn't quite work out this time. The over 7 rating is almost a crime.

This movie can best be summed up by the very first scene in which the main character is wandering through a book store, spots a book entitled "The Road to Reality", looks at it, laughs, and says "Don't want to go there". Yes it might be funny if this attitude was not so utterly common and so deeply connected with almost every major issue facing the planet today.

But still maybe a good movie could be made on such a premise, but alas, More than half the movie consists of the very annoying main character, either chatting inanely with her friends, or turning every single comment by anyone else, into a joke which only she could possibly find funny.

Yet there seem to be many reviewers here who somehow think that she is inspiring and her attitude something to aspire to, but I would argue that maybe they are confusing the strained positivity of ignorance, with the peace of mind that comes with wisdom, yet they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.

Anyway save your time unless it is indeed your goal to be an always positive airhead.

An optimistic tale from Mike Leigh of all people. This is one of those films in which everything comes gloriously together. It is impossible to imagine it without Sally Hawkins. This is one case in which actress and character merge into one spectacular creation. In fact Sally Hawkins in Happy Go Lucky and Melissa Leo in Frozen River are the two best female performances I've seen in a long, long time. Sally Hawkins's Poppy is a teacher a wise, compassionate, strong, extraordinary teacher. She seems totally unaware of it but we are not. All she knows is that she loves her job. That feeling, if true, can be very contagious. We fall for her not because some kind of gimmick but because her truth precedes her and we learn to know her and respect her almost immediately. As if this wasn't enough, she's very, very, funny.

In this latest movie from Mike Leigh we are introduced to the very sweet Poppy. Poppy is a teacher, a good laugh, a bit of a loon and a really annoying person all rolled into one but try as you might you won't hold that against her. She is an unexpectedly cute cross between Michaela Strachan and Frank Spencer. Thankfully, there's no beret but there are plenty of knockabout gags which, when coupled with Poppy's infectious giggling and quick asides, had the audience laughing along quite genuinely. Characters come and go throughout the movie with an especially good performance from Stanley Townsend, but it's Eddie Marsan who gives the stand out performance in the movie with his darkly obsessive narratives and non sequiturs which expose his sinister persona. The rest of the cast are also splendid, they all fit in just right to make this a very watchable and enjoyable movie. Even the two dimensional characters have good aspects for which they are easily forgiven. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending people to this movie, my only complaint being that it was over too soon. I could have watched how the characters developed for another day or two and I guess that's down to the fascination with the ordinary which Mike Leigh builds into his films.

On first impression, Mike Leigh's new film feels like a light-hearted, simple-minded and a briefly delightful flick. But when it comes to Leigh; you should enter with the assumption that you will leave drained from all other thoughts. Happy-Go-Lucky is no different. However, it has certainly got a balanced amount of comedic and dramatic elements, each outweighing each other once present on screen. The naturalistic and fast paced dialogue intertwined with slang and theory, with wit and sarcasm is contained for an intense, joyful and powerful viewing. Harsh and realistic danger is presented for emotional enhancement rather than the exaggerated situations in the conventional Hollywood film. We are set with a protagonist and remain with her to the end plus the pleasant charm of the British culture entwined.

Sally Hawkins shines as the lead, Poppy, in one of the best performances of the year, a seemingly naive extrovert with a very expressive and optimistic attitude towards life and all her hardships. She laughs at unfortunate events that she "suffers", such as getting her bicycle - her form of personal transport, of which she enjoys to wave at people whilst riding - stolen, as if it were a cruel irony and she gets the joke. This upbeat spirit is rarely broken, even if the polar opposite of attitudes comes into contact with her unless taken to the absolute limit. She is an inviting figure, one that which desires to inspire her mood and thoughts on life. In doing so, she becomes a primary teacher, when the mind is at it's spongiest. There is a scene where she experiments creativity with her long term roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman) in the form of cardboard boxes and more materials to make a bird-like costume. Poppy is the definitive authority figure in the film. To match her personality is the excessive clothes with often delicate unnecessary items just to provide bright colours in the darkest of hues in the scenes. This brightness transcends her performance and makes her my absolute favourite leading performance of the year.

The most expressive supporting performance comes from Eddie Marsan, as Scott, Poppy's driving instructor. However, his character is the opposite to Poppy's, always agitated and enraged when flaws occur. His character does not mix with her at all. The driving scenes are the utmost emotionally engaging scenes in the entire film and form the structure of routine giving a basis and understanding of the time frame therefore the development the characters go about in their relationships with each other - especially since they meet during his last shift so he wants to escape the working mode and enter the more relaxing mode of no responsibility. Scott constantly misinterprets Poppy's actions, as if she's sexually teasing him for her pleasure or patronizing his behaviour. During their rather short journeys of stopping, starting, arguing, repeating explanations - the tension really builds up. Every time Scott's rage is starting to show Poppy strikes him down with a joke to calm him; or maybe herself. Happy-Go-Lucky had the power to make a grin evolve across my face then wipe it straight off again within the same shot. Her comfort is very limited and only appears again with the most prominent support of Zoe (a wonderfully sarcastic performance which is an absolute joy to see every time) - even more so than her family that do appear not necessarily in an agreeable situation. There is also a rather striking and bleak scene in which Poppy encounters a tramp (played by Stanley Townsend) where he confronts her in a strange gibberish without a seeming understanding of his correct surroundings. This hobo is a symbolism of freedom, of complete and utter creativity with his language and imagination. When Poppy is presented with this person she is in a state of confusion as what to do.

This is the whole point of the film. Authority (Poppy), with it's intimidating and overbearing behaviour, overtakes that of the weaker society (the children), so fills their views when they'll most likely take it in without hassle and live by these thoughts. Despite allowing the children to express themselves through the medium of products she is still controlling them and not allowing complete freedom; yes, on the outside they may all be different, but technically they are all bird-costumes - therefore she is not able to properly inspire the creativity she wishes to do so. However, once presented with a form of society that has matured and developed their own opinions and morals it is more difficult to get through to them - hence the firmer attitude Poppy has to resort to in order to get Scott (this figure of society) to conform. The flaws become more prominent once authority is unable to abide by their own rules to make society work; which is shown during the dance classes as she is clearly out of time with everyone and making up her own moves. Or a simpler interpretation and a completely valid one, is that Poppy is a child at heart, therefore her desire to work with children and therefore her dependence on the older flatmate and the fact she prefers to use a nickname as apposed to her real name (Pauline). Or possibly willfully ignorant.

Other than Sally Hawkins incredible performance, Happy-Go-Lucky's strength comes from the balanced script, cinematography and editing, with the ability to achieve a range of tones therefore reactions from the viewer. Natural and sharp dialogue makes for always compelling and entertaining viewing. The colour is pure eye candy, with bright bold shapes and no hues between the colours giving the film personality within itself - without the help of Sally Hawkins. The score adds to the delight with a bubbly mix of string and jazz, reflecting the main characters. Although I completely understand how someone can find these irritable, I, however, find them an absolute joy; never wanting the intense, rewarding, enriching and enlightening experience to end.

Dear Readers, please see the movie before voting whether or not a review is helpful.

"Happy-Go-Lucky" (HGL) is being marketed as a lively comedy, in the vain of "Amelie," which is a far superior film that should be rented instead of seeing HGL (a search for Amelie at IMDb will bring up a review). HGL made me and my fiancée sad and annoyed that we had wasted two hours of our lives watching this dreck.

HGL is a film about several sad and miserable people and an annoying, overly-optimistic Poppy who sees the world though rose-colored-glasses no matter the problem or danger. Poppy come across as a lunatic surrounded by boring characters. No one in HGL does anything to endear themselves to any of the other characters or for that matter to the audience. Poppy may be "Happy" but her happiness is not infectious, and she does nothing that brings any joy into the film world or our world. 

HGL has few laughs and fails as a comedy; it also fails as a drama about sad and miserable people.

Please consider the environment before printing this review. For more eco-tips, try a Google search for TreeHugger.

(as you claim)... how about you start by actually listening to people, respecting them, and interacting with them in a manner that would make THEM happy, rather than behaving like an insipid, childish, self-indulgent ninny with a chronic compulsive giggle and snark problem, who expects the whole world to behave like one gigantic amusement park, designed with one goal in mind: to entertain you? 

Like several other reviewers of this movie, I signed up with IMDb just so that I could review this horrid movie. I'd like to warn away any potential viewers who have more than one brain cell intact.

This movie has nothing to say about real life, or about the real drama that each of us faces in going through life while balancing a desire for happiness with an awareness of and empathy for the challenges faced by each of us personally, and all of us globally. Aside from the insanely irritating main character and the more complex, profoundly flawed, and yet sadly sympathetic driving instructor, the rest of the characters are drawn with about as much depth as a cartoon sketch in the Sunday funnies.

The "love" story between Poppy and the social worker? Come on. The coo-coo "your eyes are so gorgeous" business on their first date made me want to puke. I guess I shouldn't have expected any more of a coherent conversation topic from Poppy, who had already been exposed as an air-headed idiot - but I thought at least her date, a social worker, would have been given something more scintillating to say as an opening gambit. (Then again, I would have thought that a social worker who comes to a school to visit a troubled little boy would have brought his own sheet of paper for the boy to draw on...) 

I loathed this movie - absolutely loathed it. The only reason I watched this ghastly thing through to the end was that I hoped - in vain - that the eternally annoying, infantile, and selfish Poppy would eventually be confronted with someone or some situation that would cause her to reevaluate her approach to life, and then to go back and apologize to each person that she had irritated with her outrageously inane behavior.

Save yourself the two hours - this lame excuse of a movie isn't worth it.

If ever a film was wonderfully summarised in a title, it is Happy-Go-Lucky. Those five syllables perfect describe the light and breezy tone of this film, and quite possibly how you will feel as you leave the cinema. This is a movie that admirably celebrates optimism, which I for one found a nice relief in an age where even Hollywood blockbusters strive to be dark and cynical.

At first, I didn't really think I was going to enjoy Happy-Go-Lucky. The opening few minutes have a couple of attempts at humour that fall rather flat: not really a positive sign in a comedy-drama. And then there is a sequence illustrating a stereotypical, painful night out: the drunken ramblings of a coven of irritating witches prove to be an instant turn-off that creates little sympathy towards Poppy, our chirpy protagonist.

But luckily Happy-Go-Lucky is a slow burner: it just takes a little while to adjust to Poppy's world. It is Poppy (or Pauline) herself that will likely begin to conjure up some goodwill. Her cheery, often illogical optimism is a difficult trait to pull off, but Sally Hawkins gives a truly exceptional performance. Poppy is an oddity in London: a woman who has decided to be endlessly upbeat in a city of dreariness and unfriendliness. Her primary coloured clothes are in sharp contrast to the grey, apathetic streets and people around her, while her constant attempts at light humour and banter are often dismissed by those she tries to cheer up. Admittedly, she does often come across as annoying and excessive, but this simply strengthens her character: she is a solid mix of likable quirks and annoying habits. Her good-will even in the most difficult of situations (one sequence where she attempts to talk to a homeless drunkard sticks out) becomes endearing, and you may well find yourself cheering her on sooner than expected. She is a multi-layered character: her motivations admirable, her outlook likable. Most importantly she is a very strong, independent person who is entirely happy with her life, and the character is more than capable of holding the film together. Hawkins' portrayal works brilliantly, and her performance is one of the most charming and memorable in quite some time.

Poppy holds the story together, and it is a great relief that her character is so compelling, as the narrative relies on her completely. Indeed, the 'story' is almost non-existent, and is simply a few chapters in the day to day life of our protagonist. The film simply comprises of a number of vignettes in Poppy's life. It documents her day-to-day encounters: dealing with a troubled boy in the class she teaches, her bizarre dancing lessons, her sojourns with an intense driving instructor. More than anything, these mini-tales try and portray the way in which Poppy tries to retain her optimism in the face of an often bleak reality. Perhaps the central story is the one focusing on her driving lessons with a racist, emotionally fragile instructor. These Saturday excursions are the best examples of the film's thematic concerns: the difficulty of remaining optimistic in a pessimistic world. While Poppy's refusal to drop her friendly mannerisms often put her at risk, ultimately her cheery attitude keeps her safe and wins over the many other characters she encounters. Director Mike Leigh seemingly urges the audience to try and be friendly in an increasingly unfriendly world through his sympathetic portrayal of Polly, which seems to me to be an entirely refreshing moral! There are dark hints throughout the film: there are subtle references to child abuse, alcoholism, obsession and other bleak issues. But these are an integral part of the film that reinforce the general happy mood. The cinematography reinforces this  often quite subtle, it makes terrific use of colour to give Poppy a central presence. Her multi-coloured clothing and her flatmate's yellow car make her stand out instantly. It is also quite a funny little movie when it wants to be: the humour is quirky and offbeat, but Leigh will likely succeed in making you laugh through his bizarre characters and situations. Driving instructor Scott's repeated refrain of Enraha is a great running joke, while the sometimes ridiculous mannerisms of Poppy are often good for a chuckle.

There are one or two issues that should be raised. Some of the sequences seem a little redundant: in particular a final-act romance that seems somewhat surplus to requirements (although it is thankfully brief). The ancillary characters sometimes seem to lack depth: Poppy's younger sister in particular. And the previously mentioned weak start is an obstacle that has to be overcome to reveal the real depth and subtlety the film has to offer.

Happy-Go-Lucky is a sprightly little film that is a truly uplifting experience. True a fantastically realised lead character, it has a lot to say about the increasing depersonalisation of contemporary society. The messages are subtle and careful, despite the excessiveness of Poppy. The film is far deeper than appearances may suggest, and while it is a very enjoyable two hours, it also lends itself to more detail examination. Catch this in the right mood and Happy-Go-Lucky's big heart (symbolised by Poppy's necklace) may just win you over.

I got such hype on this movie from the media, but found it to be such a disappointment. Maybe the intention was that this character was "trying to make everyone happy", but she came off as annoying and disruptive and attention-seeking. And all those facial movement - is she supposed to have Tourettes Syndrome? If anything proved how contrived the character is and how manipulative the story line it is this: The character goes off under a dark bridge to have some kind of face-time with a huge, dirty stranger having a psychotic episode (like any "nice" person would do) and then in another scene totally freaks out because her driving instructor is simply standing on the sidewalk looking at her apartment window. Come on! And don't get me started on the trivialized treatment of gay/lesbian and racial themes Perhaps if we all drink as heavily as Poppy, we would always have her shallow point of view. Not once did she listen to the subtext of someone else's experience until her driving instructor finally hit her and even then she didn't get that she actually was so very patronizing.

Poppy's message: Come on, be happy man, who cares what grief you might actually be feeling or in what way you might be distracted or maybe you are just at work and don't want to deal with my 3-year-old personality. Just be happy because I say so and if you aren't happy, well, you just aren't NICE.

"Insufferable," is what my roommate said as we left Mike Leigh's new film Happy-Go-Lucky. Funny: the word that kept popping up in my head throughout was, "Unbearable." I guess we were both right.

I had just finished reading Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's and patently was in the mood for something that possessed such easy levity. Happy-Go-Lucky seemed just right. What I would later learnabout five minutes into Happyis that the film is far closer in tone, concept, and subject matter to the opening pages of The Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers in which an extroverted Sister Bear can't quite grasp the concept that the rest of the world isn't nearly as nice as she, and that whether she knows or not or cares or not, there are indeed bad people in the world who are not immediately her friends.

And this seems to be the sameand onlyproblem with which the main character of Happy must contend. Played with hyperbolic espiegle that makes you want to slap her in the face on more than one occasion, relative novice Sally Hawkins is Poppy, a 30-year-old primary school teacher who can't stop smiling, giggling idiotically, and talking to everyone around her no matter if theyor wereally want to hear her or not. 

The film opens with Poppy popping poppedly into a staid bookstore. Even though she tells the lone worker in the store that she's glad to be inside from the crazy chaos of the city, the worker wants yet more serene silence than she, choosing to elide her comments until she finally, after about ten minutes of non-stop yammering, gets the point that someone like she probably belongs out in the noisy world that doesn't seem to stop or shut up.

It's all pretty much downhill from there, as we see Poppy dance lithely around the world in her obnoxious go-go boots that even her pugilistic, racist, Christian fundamentalist driving instructor chastises her about time and time again as being inappropriate both for driving and for mature adulthood in general. He may have a point, but it's the jabbing and insistent force of said point that earns the driver, an absolutely irritating Eddie Marsen, one of the high marks that led us to leaving about 20 minutes early from this stinker. This becomes the main crux of the film that, literally up until we leftat a good hour or more into the picturehad no kind of discernible conflict whatsoever aside from the obnoxiously swelling score that makes one dizzy and overwhelmed with nausea. Each scene gives us another long and droning glimpse into the life of this gelastic clown who has decided that there's no need to either grow up or to leave alone people who already have. She's either fascistically and maniacally doing all she can to get a smile out of everyone around her, no matter if they want to, or she's externalizing some superficial, self-righteous sense of ever-more-playful sympathy for people who deserve, if nothing else, far less.

The most offensive moment of such gratuitous compassion is when Poppy, as though she were some kind of bubble-headed progressive college kid or, again, Sister Bear, decides to follow the sounds of a raving derelict deep into the industrial wasteland under a bridge where she finds said derelict sitting filthily amidst some trash. Rather than running for her lifeit's England, a large city, late at night in the middle of nowhere, after allPoppy takes to speaking with the mumbling chap, admitting that, yes, she does "know" as he asks her over and over again with stereotypical bum-like repetition: "Y'know, y'know, y'know?" 

What is supposed to, I suppose, play as one scene of earnest modern life and bring a modicum of "reality" to this ridiculous jaunt of a film, really just made me not only sigh with disgust but also with some indignation. What is Leigh trying to insinuate here? What is he teaching young girls in England and the Western World over? That this kind of behavior is safe? Bold? Compassionate? Oy vey. Natural Born Killers and A Clockwork Orange can be castigated fortee heeresulting in copycat crimes, but Mike Leigh can go around telling beautiful young women that it's all right to go and talk to bums under bridges? Bah!

A similar situation grants us Poppy dealing with an abusive, redheaded scamp of a pint-sized bully in her class who can't stop hitting the other students around him. Once again, Poppy and Leigh take the moral highroad herecirca 1992and decide to feel bad for the kid, to show us that Poppy really just wants to be the student's "mate" more than anything else, lamenting to her roommate upon first realizing the problem, "Poor kid." No concern of the victims of the bully, of the other students in her class. It seems that the worst someone isa raving derelict, a pint-sized bully, an obnoxiously irate driving instructorthe more he is subject of either affection or harmless laughter in Poppy's world and Leigh's shallow film.

Already nudging me at after the first hour of Poppy's adventures through playland, my roommate had had enough and I was almost right there with him, opting to wait until there was at least some sort of conflict before finally giving up. A social worker that Poppy meets and with whom she's more than likely going to see on a less professional visit next time led me to believe maybe someone would finally give her that slap she so desperately deserved but, no the next scene gives us a an entirely new plot line involving a pregnant relative, and this is when I realized it at last: time to pop out once and for all.

The most unbelievably annoying thing I have EVER SEEN.

I have NEVER EVER seen a more annoying piece of crap cinema. The central character seems to have been designed to ANNOY the life out of people. Her friends and other characters are either also annoying but to a lesser degree, or they are just empty characters with nothing to flesh them out at all.

The only character in the movie who seems in anyway to be human is the driving instructor, who apart from being a racist conspiracy theorist is at least not completely designed to ANNOY PEOPLE TO DEATH. 

I would give my firstborn to enter into that cinema world ala 'Last action hero" and spend a pleasant hour slicing bits off this woman with a rusty spoon. I've seen some comments about this woman having an admirable upbeat attitude to life, but they must have some mental deficiency to see 'upbeat' where ADD plainly lies. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Rocky is a movie where the central character through optimism and hard work overcomes adversity. Rocky overcomes challenges with a grin. This woman ALMOST ANNOYS A MAN TO DEATH in this GODDAMN PIECE OF REFUSE.

This is really the worst worst worst kind of cinema. 

Moneris!

A film of unbelievable awfulness from the usually reliable but increasingly smug Mike Leigh.

I know Sophie Hawkins is a great actress -- I've seen her before, and she was brilliant. Here, however...well, imagine the most annoying character Catherine Tate can come up with, the most grating cheerfulness and hyperactivity she could invest in one of her sketches, a kind of anti-Lauren, if you will, then multiply that by ten and stretch it out for two hours. That would be Poppy, the main character in this film. Words cannot describe how mind-bogglingly irritating she is or how tedious it becomes.

Eddy Marsden, another fine actor, gives a similar, albeit temperamentally opposite performance, as a driving instructor so obviously deranged, such a hectoring bully from his very first scene, that it's hard to believe he has any clients at all or is even allowed in a car. Both he and Sophie Hawkins act as if given one-word character traits on an index card and told to riff round them. It's not only wearying, but it's implausible.

Other fine actors also suffer: Stanley Townsend, a great and underrated character actor, turns up as a tramp in a scene that has absolutely nothing to do with anything whatsoever and comes from nowhere. It's great to see him on the big screen, and I hope that he gets used constructively very soon rather than randomly and nonsensically inserted for some spurious dramatic effect.

Meanwhile, Leigh gets his class digs in. He really, really has a problem with the middle classes. It's always been an issue with him, and he'll leap at any opportunity to portray them as grasping, shallow, materialistic snobs, while the working classes are -- natch -- lovable and warmhearted. Here he drives this home with an unbelievably putrid scene involving Poppy's sister in Southend, in which all the clichés are trotted out within a few seconds. The sister shows pride in her house and espouses the virtues of home, babies, property and pension plans, while being portrayed as a shrill harridan who nags Poppy about her "free-spirited" lifestyle. I've seen this debate played out better in US sitcoms 30 years ago, and it's presented here on such a basic, cartoon level it adds nothing dramatically, thematically or sociologically. It's just Leigh doing his propaganda puppet show with a surprising degree of ineptitude.

This is supposed to be Leigh's "comedy", but is so dull and witless it's hard to believe it's meant to be remotely funny. "Life is Sweet" was far, far funnier, and that wasn't even trying. See that film and mourn what a great talent Leigh was. Amazing how warm and funny you can be when you're not screaming "FUNNY!" "WHACKY!!" "HEART WARMING!!".

Plus side? Great location shooting, a side of London familiar to me but not over familiar (no Tower Bridge/Gherkin/tourist shots) although it was pointed out that, in the final confrontation, the car screeches to a halt in Foxham Gardens in Tufnell Park, and Poppy gets out of the car....in a street in Camden.

Happy Go-Lucky follows the apparently insane and moronic Poppy, played by Sally Hawkins, through a few weeks of her eventful yet curiously uneventful daily life. Poppy is always annoyingly happy, yet can't seem to zero in on any real aspects of life. This movie has absolutely no plot. It is a series of unrelated and unexplained encounters centering on one annoying (really annoying!) character. Nothing is explained or important to the plot, because the movie has none. Some of the things that happen to and with Poppy are: 

1. Her bike is stolen, to which she reacts with a half-smile and snarky comment to herself.

2. She enjoys the trampoline. No further explanation.

3. She goes to a doctor for back pain and he manipulates her back. No further mention is made of the pain or the doctor.

4. She gets driving instructions from a borderline maniac with no patience. But she neither follows his instructions (to wear proper shoes, etc.) nor shows any regard for what they are doing.

5. It is hinted that she and her roommate have a lesbian relationship, but it is never brought into specific relief.

6. She has an encounter with a deranged homeless man, but nothing further is shown.

Poppy seems to be perpetually chuckling to some private inner joke that she does not share with the world or the viewer. So, with no story and no endearing characters, no particular point and no resolution of her eternally off-putting good mood, this movie is less than an non-entity; it is downright painful to endure. To make matters worse, it seems unusually long. Avoid at all costs!

I found Poppy to be annoying and unlikable except when she was with schoolchildren, which was only for a small time. There were a few mildly amusing bits of dialog but nothing particularly funny. The film went nowhere and explained nothing, even though it raised a number of relationship questions that could have been explored. We went to see it because the paper quoted a critic who gave it a 3.5 of 4 stars and said that it would all be explained "sanely." I didn't get it, even after reading several other folks' reviews. The acting was fine, which is why it wasn't a complete bomb, and I didn't walk out in the middle because I kept hoping that something--anything--would eventually become clear, although I was dying to look at my watch every few minutes. We were disappointed in our hopes. (Obviously this is my opinion because others felt that something did become clear.) I and a friend did not stay for the credits, which is very rare, because we just didn't care enough about any of it.

All of the Mike Leigh traits are present in this lovely little film: the dysfunctional family, the contrasting approaches to life and a bittersweet questioning of what it is to be happy, what it is to be human.

The film is at times both lovely and disturbing. It is life affirming but carries a caveat that unhappiness does exist in sullen faces, in madness, in neuroses. However, the central characters triumph in an engaging if quirky film that may well see you leaving the cinema with a lighter step and a lighter heart.

It is not a film that will win top awards but it is one that will remain in the memory a good while as it is thought provoking and ultimately wonderful.

If you were charmed by the zany, irrepressible antics of Roberto Benigni in "Life Is Beautiful," that Italian film that attempted to put a smiley-face on the Holocaust, you're sure to like Poppy, a 30-year-old woman who never stops grinning (broadly, toothily) and cracking jokes (and cackling at them) and fidgeting and in general acting like a child on a sugar high. In fact, you'll probably fall in love with her, which is what director Mike Leigh says he thinks anyone of any sense would do.

Personally, I found Poppy moronic, grating, and generally pretty insufferable -- but then, I'd probably feel the same about anyone who never shuts up, who never stops giggling, and who even smiles goofily when (at the start of the film) she discovers her bicycle's been stolen. Maybe her penchant for throwing back her head and whinnying with laughter, no matter what the situation, is philosophically commendable, and maybe she's a living saint (the movie would like us to think so), but she brings out the sourpuss in me, the impatient adult that wants to say "Grow up" and "Keep quiet" and "Get serious." 

Mike Leigh famously makes improvisational films, which is one reason actors enjoy working with him. And some of his films -- "Topsy-Turvy," "Career Girls," maybe "Secrets and Lies" -- are among my favorites. Yet he's also made some of the most tiresome and preachy films (and stage plays) I've ever had to sit through. This one -- and I'm relying, in part, on interviews with Leigh and the cast -- clearly endorses Poppy's world-view; she's seen as a Free Spirit and praised for her unjudgmental friendliness, openness, emotional generosity, compassion, love, enlightenment, blah blah blah. To me, she typifies a sort of squishy let-me-give-you-a-hug attitude that pervades the modern British nanny state.

It's interesting that Eddie Marsan's character, who doesn't fit in and who expresses disapproval of things like modern-day moral slackness, multiculturalism, and lack of discipline, is soon revealed as a complete malcontent, paranoid, and conspiracy nut. Leigh's right-of-center characters all tend to be caricatures.

As if to accentuate the relentlessly saccharine tone of the film, it is punctuated by a horribly winsome, indie-ish flute soundtrack that seems to stand back and declare, as we watch Poppy flutter about London, "Awww, ain't she just the cutest thing?" 

By the way, Sally Hawkins herself, the actress, IS awfully cute (I remember being quite intrigued by her in one of the director's dreariest movies, "All or Nothing"), and I strongly suspect, judging from things he's said, that the middle-aged Leigh has more or less fallen for her -- which is, God knows, understandable -- and has created this movie to celebrate and expand upon a certain happy-go-lucky aspect of Hawkins's own personality. I can't help wishing that, instead of inflicting this movie on us, he'd contented himself with simply having an affair with her.
