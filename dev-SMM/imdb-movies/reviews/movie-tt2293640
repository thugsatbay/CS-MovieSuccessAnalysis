### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for money! This just felt rushed, with loads of stock jokes, maybe hoping enough of them would hit the mark - they didn't.

What an enviable list of voice-over stars. 

What fun characters mouthing multi-language pseudo-meaninged gibberish (as opposed to just gibberish). 

What a great start with a series of interesting minion history snippets (all of them already in the trailer - yes, those are the best bits and nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close).

What frustration when the gear just gets stuck - and the whole thing numbingly grinds into predictable land with uninteresting plot, an array of boring characters  blah blah  and ends up just another multimillion gibberish animation.

After the first 10 mins, Minions is plagued by too many unnecessary pointless characters, plain villains, inconsequential dialogue and actions  and the boredom (and depression) that the Minions experience on screen is unfortunately also paralleled at the same time by the audience and never really lifted up after that.

Surprisingly, Allison Janney's character and voice was the most distinctive, but it was only a minor role. Sandra Bullock's villain Scarlett Overkill is way underdone, and the character visualization lacks any wickedly engaging factor, just boringly unlikeable. Jon Hamm's character adds nothing at all to the flimsy plot and his voice is too generic to matter as to who is doing it. All the other stars had inconsequential and indistinctive who-cares voice-overs.

The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun  but way too late.

Watch it, but don't expect too much and you'd probably be mildly entertained.

I avoided watching Despicable Me for a long time. I just didn't like the look of it. But as it turned out, I loved the film when I was eventually coerced into seeing it by one of my nephews. It was thanks to him that I also liked the second movie. As for the third movie, I don't know why some IMDb users are complaining that this movie is more suitable for 'kids and families'. It seems odd to expect anything more from The Minions when that is the main target audience! I watched this film with my own family and since this was the first time I took my toddler to the cinema, it makes it extra special. I enjoyed the movie, laughed out at several points and liked it even more to see how much my daughter loved it. We all had a good time and there were no complaints at all. This one, like Despicable Me 1 and 2, was great entertainment, lots of villainy and slapstick humour. It is the best kids animation I've seen in a long time. A lot of fun.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a historical account that acknowledges the influence (much less the existence of) the Minions throughout time. No matter how many textbooks are produced and released each year, almost ZERO of them note the presence of this incredibly powerful minority group. 

Well, where history has silenced the Minions, let this surprisingly accurate documentary speak volumes. I found no embellishments of history throughout this 91-minute feature. It would have been easy to swing the pendulum of power to overemphasize the history of the Minions as it relates to major world events, but the filmmakers didn't go for the easy shots. They simply told the truth, and what we are left with are the clear facts of what really happened to the dinosaurs, the cavemen, and--what I'm sure will be most controversially-- the true lineage of royalty in England. Very bold.

If this doesn't win the Oscar for Documentary Feature, we will truly know which side of history the Academy stands on.

This is not a complicated film. There is no sophisticated humour. Most of it is toddler level. 

The plot is summarized on the trailers. The minions are a tribe of yellow round things that want to assist villains in their villainy. They have been doing this since the dawn of time. Historically they have run in to difficulties in their quest to identify the perfect bad guy to serve. After repeated failures they withdrew to the arctic and attempted to entertain themselves, putting the concerns of other life forms to the side.

The protagonists, Bob, Stuart and Kevin are three minions that decided to brave the unknown and seek out a new leader. They depart and arrive in New York, in 1968. Essentially, we then follow their adventures throughout the film. 

Wackiness ensues. The laws of physics are suspended. Gibberish is spoken to wondrous effect.

You don't have to be 2 years old to love this film. I personally love it, and I'm an adult without children. I don't even really like children, but if I had a child I imagine they would like this film. The Minions have this magical quality that forces the rational mind to check out, like anything adorable. They're mischievous, clumsy, and sweet - they want to do good, and this makes them endearing. 

Some have complained that this movie lacks substance. I would respond that you don't need substance with a movie like this. It is gold, yellow gold.

But, I am sorry for all the mass marketing.

The popularity and the huge profits of Despicable Me franchise has driven the eagerness of Illumination Entertainment to produce a minions spin-off solely to entertain the fans. Caught in variations of the same scenarios, the decision to put more focus on the three minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob might remind audiences about Alvin and the Chipmunks or the three daughters of Gru. While the animation does remain the fun, hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. The cuteness of the minions is the main element for entertainment rather than the dialogue itself in which the jokes aren't as funny as Despicable Me's series. Nonetheless, it is still energetic, actions packed, visually stunning and colorful for family audiences even its creative mistake drags its overall quality, proving that these banana lovers are far more effective and surprising to be supporting characters just as in the main franchise.

Apparently the minions in Despicable Me weren't created by Gru. They're a group of being that date from prehistoric times to serve the most evil people imaginable. From the Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon Bonaparte. But they find they always inadvertently kill their masters. They feel depression and isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Until one day in 1968 Kevin (Pierre Coffin) goes to the world again with two other minions Stuart (Coffin) and Bob (Coffin) to find a master. They get to New York, New York where they hear about Scarlet Overkill (how subtle) (Sandra Bullock) who is aiming to be the world's first female super villain. What follows is a big series of jokes and quite the story line that makes this a great movie. To those reading this review look at your schedule and make time to bring your family to this film tonight. You won't regret it. It has fun characters, comedy, and all the minions that made the last two films so great.

Firstly,Thank to Pierre Coffin to design the Minions, the best animated characters we ever had. As they are obviously funny to watch,the movie is quiet good with most of their presence,but gone eager for the first 20 minutes for the kick start entry of Minions.A Must watch Perfect Family entertainer. The Character of Sandra bullock is pretty good and the dialogs in the movie are written well.The story was framed clearly and the voice of all 899 minions given by the Pierre coffin is awesome.The other crew of the movie also acted well.Especially the three major roles of the movie Kevin,Stuart,Bob are the strongest traits for the movie. The screenplay is well done and great editing.

First, as I mentioned in the title of the minions movie definitely had to be done. Because it is one of the most important elements bearing the serial Despicable Me minions. Despicable Me minions in the series of the effect of being so famous too big. This film has been put very clever jokes. And Despicable Me keeps it also replaces the series has been really fun. England have made a nice joke. But I think that members of IMDb get a little serious. Because it shows voting. Overall I think this is an animated film would not hurt a little joke. Here I saw a lot of flying animation and animation scores this could be a bit better. But unfortunately IMDb's not tolerate this kind of thing. Despicable Me series of lovers almost think I will get the same pleasure. In addition, this film is graced with great rock musics director for Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin thanks.

My seven year old was excited to see it. I expected it to be pish. But it was worse than I imagined. I fell asleep a few times but the annoying yelling pretend dialogue woke me up. I couldn't even get a nap out of my wasted afternoon. At least I didn't have to worry about my kid laughing too loudly and disturbing anyone else's sleep. He got bored too. Just utter crap. They clearly spent a lot on the music. The Beatles, the kinks, and van Halens eruption as a guitar solo at the merciful end to this travesty of a film. If only they had spent the money on a scriptwriter rather than the over- caffeinated sixth graders they got hopped up on juice boxes before handing them some paper to defecate on and call that a script. The humor in the film was non existent. I expected lots of broad fart jokes and low brow stupidity aimed at chimps, five year olds, and the same kind of morons who made Kevin James a star. What I got was obvious pop culture references not as punchlines or set up for jokes. Just there. As if the existence of a reference to something recognizable was in and of itself funny. Perhaps it served as a confidence booster for the gump-like, slack jawed, troglodytes that were the target audience. They could all feel jolly clever after recognizing such obscure references as the Beatles. Well done. If I had a time machine and only choose to change one thing in the pas, forget hitter, I would go back to stop whoever green lit this cinematic excretion.

Minions is a movie that tells the origin story of the cute, yellow, goggle wearing creatures that gained massive popularity in Despicable Me(2010) & Despicable Me 2(2013). The Minions(Pierre Coffin) have been on Earth, far longer than humans have. They have only one purpose. Find the baddest & most despicable super-villain of all time. Their journey to find the baddest boss takes them on a long & tumultuous adventure. Finding a boss wasn't difficult. However, keeping a boss turned out to be particularly hard due to one hilarious mishap after another. Finally, three Minions namely, Kevin, Stuart & Bob take the initiative to make sure all the Minions have the most evil & despicable boss to work for. This leads the trio to, Scarlett Overkill(Sandra Bullock). Scarlett has nefarious plans to take over the world, with the help of Kevin, Stuart & Bob. 

Minions is an extremely funny movie. This is thanks to the goofy antics of the adorable titular characters. I loved the idea of a Villain Con. This film had me guffawing throughout its run-time. However, it lacks the heart & emotional depth of the Despicable Me movies. Characters like, Gru, Margo, Edith & Agnes are missed. Don't worry though. The Minions, with their mildly understandable gibberish & various idiosyncrasies will make this film thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family. Though most of the gags involving the Minions get repetitive, it still manages to crack you up, every single time. The animation & 3D are fantastic. Sandra Bullock is brilliant as Scarlett Overkill. Jon Hamm is amazing as Herb Overkill. Michael Keaton is spectacular as Walter Nelson. Allison Janney is awesome as Madge Nelson. Steve Coogan is good as Professor Flux/Tower Guard. Jennifer Saunders is outstanding as The Queen. Geoffrey Rush is great as the Narrator. I loved Steve Carell's cameo as Young Gru. Last but not the least, Pierre Coffin steals the show as The Minions. A must watch for all fans of the Despicable Me franchise.

Before I proceed please note that I have not seen the Despicable Me movies. I merely took a chance with this one. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised to find it decently entertaining, despite its intended target audience and the fact that I've been around for at least 38 years.

IMDb reviewer elliemcnair and Co. have beautifully summarized the plot so I'll go straight to my 2 cents': the movie is entertaining in the sense that it has something for the young and the young at heart to enjoy, while having other things that more mature audiences can also appreciate. It was a treat to see references to British culture and pop culture such as James Bond, the Beatles, rock and roll, etc.. 

The people who will best appreciate this movie, however, are the fans of the Despicable Me movies or folks who love the minions' silly antics. The latter idea was what caused the move to feel like hit-and-miss for me depending on the scene. Certain jokes and scenes were humorous to me while others felt a bit flat, as if the writers were trying a bit too hard to provide something funny just for the sake of having a joke.

Overall, however, it was easy for me to to empathize and identify with the title characters' search for a master to serve. Ultimately, that is what appeals to adults: the identification with a desire to find--even create--meaning and purpose in one's life. Yes, the movie is a comedy yet it is also a metaphor for life. It is nice to know that underneath the seemingly mindless slapstick humor is a deeper meaning that all of us can resonate with, regardless of age or station.

The little yellow fellows who assist Despicable Me's Gru have, over the centuries, always sought to help the biggest, baddest Boss around. And so, in the 1960s, Stuart, Kevin and Bob, seeking out a new Boss, end up working for villaness Scarlet Overkill as she seeks to usurp the British throne for herself.

The Minions find themselves in their own well-deserved feature, and it's a hoot. The story concentrates on just 3 of the Minions  a smart move, since we get to know them personally  although the full crew do turn up when necessary. Scarlet Overkill is a very good baddie, and the various scenarios are all colourfully realised (London is great, if geographically inaccurate). It is daft, and great fun.

For Beatles fans it is worth mentioning that there is a lovely Beatles-related gag in it. And, while the voice talent is all excellent, it is worth singling out Pierre Coffin, whose voice characterisations in the Minions' almost-language is a huge part of their charm.

The 3D is good in places, but mostly forgettable.

I was really looking forward to this after really enjoying Despicable Me and Despicable Me II.

If this had been a standalone film rather than a spin off i'd say it would warrant 7 out of 10 but following on from the minions being major highlights in both Despicable me movies this was really disappointing.

Just not enough of the silly shenanigans from the minions that you'd expect and a lot of quite pointless and quite frankly boring dialogue in parts.

I'm taking my nephews to go see this soon and I really doubt it'll hold there attention - that's how boring it is.....

Disappointed.

I loved both of the Despicable Me films, and had looked forward to the Minions Movie for months. It certainly did not disappoint! Bob totally steals it for being adorable and funny, and the ending is perfect! My mum doesn't normally enjoy comedy, but the Minions sent both of us and my brother into hysterics that were louder than the collective laughter of the children in the theatre! There are a few jokes in it I don't expect children will understand too well and a couple of risqué moments that are obviously intended for older viewers, but I do believe that it engages viewers of all ages well and tells a lovely story with plenty of hijinks to entertain everyone! Illuminations are well on track to surpass the likes of Disney with their animation, and I would not be surprised if this is considered a permanent fixture of children's classic films for generations to come.

Having read bad reviews I went with low expectations. But as the movie started my laughter overshadowed my expectations. 

Kevin, Stuart and Bob go on a journey to find a super villain to be their tribe's boss.

Yes, the story was predictable and it may not have been as good as Despicable me 1 and 2 but to be honest it really didn't matter. It was amazingly funny and there was not a single moment in which I got bored. Also the jokes were not at all kiddish and would make a person of any age laugh. 3D was also pretty good. 

So i would recommend you to leave the serious part of your brain at your house and watch this hilarious and light hearted movie of the adorable minions.

P.S If you haven't watched the trailer, don't.You will enjoy the movie much more.

"Minions" is one of the most anticipated movies because of its child-friendly concepts and storyline. The story's concept about finding a master was very detailed. It started from the pre-historic time up to the present. The hilarious and outgoing personality of the characters will fill all the viewer's eyes with laughter and tears of joy. The director has successfully brought the essence of loyalty and stewardship. I like the entire storyline because it never brings a single boring and dull moments throughout the film. To sum it up, the movie will surely crave people to look forward for the next episode. For that, I will give a 9 over 10 score for this movie.

This movie was actually very hilarious and I hope to see another if it is made. This movie was a very funny movie that the funny parts never ended. I really appreciated how the intro showed evolution of the minions and basically is how evolution started any way. I was very happy with this movie because in the beginning it showed that the minions killed the dinosaurs and destroyed the pyramids and I could not stop laughing. It was a very awesome prequel and very cool to show how the minions met Gru in the first place. I think the movie would have been even better if it was a sequel to the regular despicable me. I think in total it was hilarious how the minions were so silly and focused on hurting each other with certain situations. In total, it was one of the funniest movies I have seen.

Let's get this out of the way first: Minions is silly, nonsensical and completely designed as a marketing device to sell toys or other assorted merchandise bearing the goggled eyes of its childish leads. The story is mostly just an excuse to let the franchise's most popular asset run amok, and those searching for greater meaning are already on a fool's errand. Of course, there's still undeniable fun to be had by joining these little guys on a whirlwind adventure that spans the globe, and despite the fact that many of the plot developments are slapdash in their execution, the Minions encounter a number of laugh-out-loud moments that will have kids giggling uncontrollably even when their parents elicit only a chuckle or two.

I watched this with the whole family, ages ranging from 11-41... And to be honest there wasn't much laughing going on. 

I'll tell you what I did like: the animation was great, and what I found most appealing as a grown up watching this was the nice little musical references, like Hair and The Beatles, and the soundtrack throughout the whole movie. A few minor laughs here and there but unfortunately that was it.

I would think a kid from 0-10 would like it, just the way it likes most any cartoon. Slapstick comedy, funny talk and cute pet-like beings... The main target is probably this age and there it can't go wrong.

But for older and adults I think it is way too childish.

MINIONS review by: Mike Smith 

For centuries of looking for the most despicable boss and coming up short, 3 Minions, Stuart, Kevin and Bob search for a new leader to bring joy to the rest of their tribe. After being recruited by super-villain Scarlett Overkill, Stuart, Kevin and Bob go off on an action packed adventure. 

This maybe the best film in the trilogy. The story is fun, funny and action packed; the story never really has a sad point like most animated films and the story never has a dull moment. I laughed out loud throughout the whole film. 

One thing that stands out in this film is that most of the dialog is the minions and most of the words are gibberish. But you don't need subtitles to understand what is go on because it plays like Pingu or Mr. Bean. Our two other main cast members are played by Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm; they did an awesome job because not for one moment did I think of them as anyone else other than their characters. One set of characters I enjoyed in this film are played by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney who are a family of robbers; I'd like to see a spin off based on them. 

The animation is great and Minions uses some different styles of animation, there is 3D animation which is throughout the whole film, some 2D animation and even a bit of stop motion animation. I think all of the different styles were all done by computers instead of the traditional ways for making stop motion and 2D, but it still looks great. 

With action, comedy and all around fun; I had a grin from ear to ear, I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't get enough of this movie. Great animation, great plot, great humor, what's not to love? Cheers and remember, life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch.

I am in my sixties and did not know what to expect but I and the rest of the audience, half youngsters and the rest mature cinema-goers loved the film. It was excellent from the very beginning to the end - that is the very end as patrons were warned not to leave the cinema before all the credits had finished rolling. I can understand why youngsters love the film and why our supermarkets are full of all the Minion bits and pieces. I learnt from the cinema manager that many were returning for a second viewing because the fun comes so fast you may miss bits the first time round. I do hope that another film will be available for the Christmas 2015 holidays

Money over art --this is the undisputed law that Hollywood has churned up, and you can't blame them: who doesn't like money? Unfortunately the audience takes the toll when they are delivered disappointments. Something else that one sees throughout all of Hollywood is the inability to know when to stop. Minions proved to be the perfect showcase for these two ubiquitous aspects of Hollywood.

Minions is a prequel/spin off of the loved and critically acclaimed Despicable Me movies. In Minions we are told about the origin of Gru's (Steve Carrell) yellow, banana-loving helpers. The minions' objective in life is to serve the biggest and most evil villain of them all, so throughout history we see them serving (unsuccessfully) such figures like a T-Rex, a caveman, Count Dracula, and even Napoleon (I'm glad they didn't show the minions in the 40s). After decades of inactivity in the North Pole, three brave minions decide to set out and find a new master. These minions are Kevin, Bob, and Stuart, and they trek through all sorts of environments and finally reach 60s New York City, where they find out about Villain-Con where all of the world's villains will gather for an annual convention including the infamous Scalett Overkill (Sandra Bullock).

I have to say that the first half of the film had me mesmerized and laughing at the minions and their arguments in gibberish. I can't blame the studios for doing a minion spin-off, since the yellow characters completely stole the show in both Despicable Me films and they were a commercial hit. However, carrying a film out entirely on their own is much more of a challenge than brief sparks as supporting characters. And unfortunately the minions' humor burned out at the halfway point of the film. The story itself, which had been so sophisticated and surprisingly intricate up to that point suddenly took a turn and became a predictable childish lump. The humor started to go on a loop so that every joke was used at least four times by the time the film ended. And I think that this was such a problem because the filmmakers were trying to extend the runtime in order for this to be qualified a film and not a short.

However, I don't want to shame the filmmakers at all; it's hard to make a film where the main characters speak a mixture of gibberish, Spanish, Italian, French, and English. I actually admire the bold move of taking basically "mute" characters (in the sense that all their dialogue doesn't mean anything) and telling a story in a simple enough way that children can understand it.

But even so you cant help but feel that the second half of the film is extremely forced, so much that it takes down the entire film with it. And the ending is too fairytale-ish and ties all the loose ends a bit too conveniently. So overall the film is a bit of a let down, with a strong first half and weak second, but even so it's worth seeing the admirable work of the directors and writers by placing "mute" characters in their lead roles.

"Minions" doesn't really have anything new to offer, aside from crassly commercializing the yellow side players in the "Despicable Me" movies. You sort of accept that going in. Personally, I've always been fond of the little pill-shaped bastards, which is why I enjoyed this movie. It's 90 minutes of exactly what you'd expect from them and it turns out that's enough to sustain a whole movie. The cast is great, despite the miscast Sandra Bullock (not a slight, I like her) and the humor is just right for a light-as-it-gets Summer movie. The '60s setting also worked surprisingly well.

Honestly, as toy commercials go, you could do a whole lot worse.
