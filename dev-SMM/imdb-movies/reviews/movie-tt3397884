### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
"Sicario" describes, with surgical precision, the fatal and bloody desecration of Mexico as a result of its decades long cartel war. And it does so by compressing this almost endless tragedy into a two-hour tour-de-force of filmmaking. 

At its center we find idealistic FBI-Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited to pursue a Mexican drug-baron. She is being guided by a seemingly untouchable covert assassin named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Their investigation and methods are pushed further into unknown territory where justice and morality are no longer valid. The end not only justifies the means, it requires them.

Denis Villeneuve's masterful piece exemplifies not only filmmaking of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a socio-political nightmare that is fueled by first world-habit and global economics.

Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has taken.

From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that "Sicario" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.

Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time, that life nevertheless continues.

Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using familiar elements in an extremely skillful manner.

All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall. 

Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves". 

Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario" that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic" held onto have been eviscerated. 

What now? One might ask.

One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.

With this Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.

All of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don't feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that's something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.

Of course one couldn't get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn't one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached.

What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike "Prisoners", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt's partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.

Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year.

More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic." SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.

Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.

To me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It's somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt's Kate Macer knows she's being used but she wants to know what she's being used for. Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he's skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there's a certain dark pain that's magnetic about him. It's all in the eyes. Oscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.

I've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means 'hit-man,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?

The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.

Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying Kate Macy, a career policewoman heading a SWAT team. Her accent slips slightly a couple of times, but otherwise she's utterly believable as born and raised in the deep south of the US. Kate is a fundamentally decent, honorable human being, trying to the right thing in a world where the rule book doesn't seem to work any more. She's smart, tough, and experienced - but right from the start of the movie, it's clear that she's in over her head.

The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to avoid any clean and easy action movie clichés, and it pays off enormously as the movie goes on.

It's also a highly intelligent movie, made for an intelligent audience. It doesn't lay things out on a plate. Instead you have to pay attention and you have to think, just as Kate has to - because her first mistake could be her last.

Staging, costuming, sets, cinematography, and lighting are all perfect. Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is, while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no less. This part of the movie is in the "As good as it gets" category. The only part that I didn't like (and the reason that this doesn't get a 10 from me) was the music. It's used deliberately to heighten tension during some scenes which would otherwise break the feel of the movie, and generally it's done well, but some scenes are spoiled with a There Will Be Blood styled screech. It's really not needed, especially since Sicario's own score manages to build or maintain tension quite successfully in other parts of the movie while remaining low-key.

To my mind, this is much more of a drama than it is a thriller. It's certainly not an action movie. The acting from the support cast is exactly what it needs to be - good in general, and great when a minor character is the focal point - but look closely at how much Benicio del Toro manages to do with no dialogue and not even all that much movement. Simply amazing.

This is a great movie to see if you want to be challenged.

Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that's sure to give your heart its full day's work, Denis Villenueve's masterful "Sicario" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve's direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that's been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.

"Sicario" tells the story of an idealistic FBI agent names Kate (Blunt), who is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. With the "guidance" of a mysterious agent Alejandro (Del Toro) and her superior Matt (Brolin), and influx of intrigue and morals will shake Kate to her very core.

First and foremost, "Sicario" breathes new life into contemporary cinematography, as produced by no less than the great Roger Deakins. A vessel for God's eye on the world, Deakins ignites the fire of his vision, capturing some of the finest shots seen this decade. His use of shadows, CGI, and choices in which to convey and portray emotions is downright genius. Becoming essentially another character in the story, Deakins gives a master's class on cinematography for future craftsmen and women to behold. It's a work that will surely land him his thirteenth Oscar nomination.

Above that, we are treated to fantastic and awards worthy performances. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt's ability to connect with the character's soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in "Zero Dark Thirty" but with more reserve.

Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since "21 Grams." A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in "No Country for Old Men" or Gene Hackman in "The French Connection." You won't be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor's in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well.

As a technical endeavor, "Sicario" also succeeds in its vibrantly living sound design, and illustrious score by Academy Award nominee Jóhann Jóhannsson. The two are married in a blistering union of tension and heart palpitations. Editor Joe Walker is a shining star behind the scenes as well, thanks to his precision and patience in bringing a scene right to the edge, and knowing when and where to take it next. It's his most innovative work yet, even surpassing his nominated work on "12 Years a Slave."

Goes without saying that "Sicario" is Denis Villenueve's best work to date. Coming from someone that thoroughly enjoyed "Prisoners" and tolerated "Enemy," this is his most accessible and compelling piece. If anything, he's just so damn exciting to watch these days, as he locates strange vehicles for actor's and craftsmen to come together. He takes on a genre that may feel familiar, like the drug cartel, but makes it feel new and smart.

"Sicario" is hands down one of the year's best films.

This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.

Emily Blunt was amazing in her character, a good FBI agent who feels she's not doing enough on the streets and allows herself to get used by someone with more power, played by Josh Brolin brilliantly as a man who seems uncharismatic about his job in order to hide the covert nature of his mission to find the big man responsible for all the street crime.

Brolin played a necessary evil, that comes off brilliantly in the narrative that plays out. Loved how they go from the bottom and get to the very top. It's very surgical. 

But the actor who stole the show in Sicario is Benicio del Toro whose character Alejandro, is a cloud of mystery that unravels slowly through the film, done both subtle and dramatic by Del Toro. Every time he was on the screen even when he did nothing he was doing something and you he demanded your attention.

Plus the music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. it was powerful.

Incredible action-thriller.

The wait is over. Since the trailer came out, I watched it several times a week. That's how hyped up I was. I finally got to watch Sicario, Denis Villeneuve's latest film. It got a very positive reception at the Cannes festival, and got tons of praise from movie critics worldwide.

My very first recommendation to anyone interested in watching this film is to not watch the trailer, or don't watch it repeatedly like I did. Although it's incredibly exciting, it gives way too much away. Sicario basically consists of approximately 6-7 set-pieces. The trailer shows key moments from all the set-pieces, and leaves you knowing almost just as much about the story as you'll get to know watching the actual film.

Sicario features a pretty thin storyline, but to its defence, it's all part of a tactical approach at keeping things blurry, shady, and mysterious to the audience. Metaphorically, these mechanisms serve the story pretty well, as we watch official government agencies use unorthodox methods and people in this bloody war against the cartels, and the intent is to offer a glimpse at an ongoing situation and let the viewer's imagination fill in the blanks.

That came off as a bit of an odd artistic choice to me, as, in recent years, several films and TV shows have thoroughly explored all the horrors resulting from the war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. It's not exactly a brand new subject matter to worldwide audiences. My point, basically, is that it's an odd timing to choose such a broad approach to a subject that has become familiar to the masses. When my imagination had to fill in the blanks, it basically did it with memories of other films and TV shows exploiting the very same subject matter, and that dug deeper into it.

All the technical aspects of Sicario are off the charts. Denis Villeneuve's directing is spectacular. The sequence with the convoy of SUVs in Juarez has to rank among the most beautifully shot scenes that we have seen in a while, with a combination of breath-taking shots of Mexican landscapes, Juarez and its streets, incredible tension building up inside the vehicles, and how the different characters handle it. Roger Deakin's cinematography is flawless, as expected. Whether portraying a dry, sunny afternoon in Arizona or a nightly tactical operation with agents wearing night vision goggles, Deakins' contribution shines in every possible way. The same can be said about the soundtrack and the editing.

One thing that truly surprised me is how Sicario makes its point. It is intended to leave you with an overall impression on a global situation (the border war, the cartels, the way government agencies operate, etc.), and the actual story and characters become purposely subsidiary in that depiction of a broader picture. This is just another day in this war, just another set of dirty tactics, just another escalation of violence, just another dozen of people among thousands doing shady things in this mess of a war on drugs. 

And if there is one flaw to this film, that's where it lies, in my humble opinion. Characters and storyline are fundamentals. Without saying that these two aspects were neglected, I feel like this is where Villeneuve's film could have reached that next level, but unfortunately didn't, by keeping everything so vague, and so volatile.

I'm not going to sugar coat it: Emily Blunt's character is one-dimensional. Her performance is good, but the character has a very simple purpose in the whole picture, and it never goes beyond that. Some secondary characters get enough screen time to let you think that they'll eventually have a true impact on the story, or be part of some sub-plot. Here again, some minor disappointments as a result. Again, it's part of a mechanism to make everyone look like a tiny dot in the big picture, but prevented me from being truly compelled by the story unfolding and most of the characters that were part of it.

Josh Brolin's and Benicio Del Toro's performances are both amazing, though. Again, you do not get to know a lot about them. That being said, the few times when you get to see more than just what's on the surface, you'll get enough hints to partly understand their true nature. But again, you'll notice that I had to use the word "partly", especially when it comes to Brolin's character. A lot is left unexplained. And while this opens up a world of possibilities where speculations get darker by the minute, I was left wanting to know more when the credits started rolling.

Overall, Sicario succeeded in leaving me feeling deceived, just like I was an extension of Kate Macer. The way it operates is quite unique, as a lot of unexplained details, characters, and events leave the viewer speculating in an environment filled with lies, shadiness, and broken ideals. The visuals and the soundtrack will blow you away. Also, the final scene was a perfect way to seal the deal, and goes perfectly in line with the "big picture" approach that this film takes.

Overall, a very entertaining drama/thriller, full of technical brilliance, and some slightly flawed fundamentals. Definitely worth a watch.

I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.

That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think they're cool.

What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking. When I'm watching Expendables 3, I'm ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking. That's not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted problem.

*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot from the perspective of an ingénue, this time in the form of a "small-time" FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two of her fellow officers are killed, she's ready to go after the big guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use "unconventional" (read: highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there to "watch and learn", but ultimately she finds out that she is only there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her function is not to "watch and learn" but to shut up, keep out and to sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...

*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book about it. What's the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don't stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why don't they keep a lane open? Why didn't they use a helicopter? Why don't they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold their bankrolls together? And on and on.

Five points because of the acting and the cinematography. For an intelligent thriller on the Mexican drugs war, I'd recommend Traffic over Sicario any time.

Jesus.

This was intense. So much so that it made me kind of uncomfortable. I was squirming in my seat. And it was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into wholly compelling cinema.

The cast was uniformly excellent. The big three of Blunt, Brolin & Del Toro are all crazy good. Even though Blunt has the lead role it's definitely not a showy part...it's very understated with a lot of it consisting of looks. An internal performance, for sure, but one that might just be the best of her career. Brolin is given a role that at first seems like nothing more than comic relief, but as the film goes on he keeps becoming more and more a part of the character until close to the end when all the jokes disappear and he becomes something else entirely. It was really cool to see that transition. Very good work from him and there are times where it feels like he's stealing the whole movie away from the others. Which brings me to Mr. Del Toro. What else is there to say except Ho Lee Sh!t. This man was just on a completely different level with this performance. Another one that begins very internal consisting of a lot of looks mixed with one or two word responses...then gradually as the film progresses and his background and motives become clearer he, like Brolin, becomes something else entirely. But at the same time never going overboard with it...still keeping that quiet intensity he's had throughout. All three performances are absolutely fantastic and among the best of the year. Hell, Del Toro's might even be the best of the year. Haunting stuff.

As mentioned above this a very intense film. The set-pieces in this are unbelievable. The opening raid, The Border crossing, The night- vision/tunnel sequence and finally The dinner scene. Just pure craziness.

With that being said - I don't think this is an Oscar movie. It's just way too dark for the Academy's liking. Very much like Villeneuve's Prisoners, both films are more than deserving of awards attention, but unfortunately the Academy rarely goes for films this dark.

See this movie ASAP. Preferably in a theater. Just know you might need a shower afterward.

Sicario doesn't live up to the hype. Emily Blunt's character runs around and stumbles upon things like she's Bella Swan from Twilight: New Moon. Benicio Del Toro's character's story is the most interesting part of the movie but, his story doesn't come about until halfway into the movie. Emily Blunt is completely underutilized here; Her character makes some of the stupidest decisions but, some of it is justified. All Emily Blunt really does in this movie is stumble upon things, makes stupid decisions, and smokes a ton of cigarettes. Benicio Del Toro is a bad-ass in this movie and his scenes are the most interesting, but Del Toro's story isn't engaging enough because it is lacking what the rest of the movie is lacking... a story. Sicario plays more on beats, tone, images, and simplicity rather than dramatic story elements and sentimental emotion. This movie is extremely blood soaked, violent, and sometimes haunting, but that's all it has going for it. This movie means nothing, it starts nowhere, and it ends nowhere. The movie is 100% predictable minus a couple of moments with Del Toro towards the end. If you want to see a boring tension-filled blood-soaked horror feast than enjoy. If you want to see an engaging and emotionally charged character driven story (including all of the extreme blood-soaked horror violence) than pass on this one because it's not present.

The overall ideas and the way they present the scenes were intense and received quite the reaction it perhaps intended. First few minutes with scary death bodies inside the walls were very promising. However, most of the plots are poorly written, is it real that a big cartel was only guarded by few people? But the other (men) lead characters played their part okay, they lifted the poorly written story a little bit.

Most critics go to Emily Blunt's character. Up until now, I still don't get why was she even there. I don't get the "tension" or whatever it is she's supposed to be showing, maybe conflicts? To me, it is unrealistic for a field agent who's been "kicking doors since day one" really follow the rules by the book with no adaption at all. And the supposedly "smart" agent doesn't get how bad a cartel can be is beyond me - I'm no police but I get how bad "cartel" can get, and I only used imagination. I just don't get it, I feel only annoyed with the character, she is really unnecessary. 

Overall, I only get this "annoyed by Emily Blunt" feeling after watching the movie, not much anything else. I'm giving some marks for the other actors and for the "tense".

Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast.

Director: Denis Villeneuve

Writer: Taylor Sheridan

Starring: Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin

Release Date: September 18, 2015

MPAA Rating: R for strong violence, grisly images, and language

Runtime: 2 hours and 1 minute

Studio: Lionsgate

I have never seen any of director Denis Villeneuve's previous films, so I didn't know what to expect from this at first. However, I then saw the trailer and it was so amazing, that it got me excited. The great early reviews and cast, also helped as well. After seeing Sicario, I can definitely say that it is a masterpiece of a crime thriller. Wow, it was amazing.

The plot of Sicario focuses on an FBI agent named Kate Macer. Kate is enlisted by a government official to aid people from the other side of the law, in their mission to track down a drug lord, who has been responsible for multiple grisly murders.

This sounds like a simple plot, on the surface, however the way it is told is very engaging. There were honestly many moments, that I never saw coming, and made the plot more unpredictable. The film could be a slow burn for some, however I found myself consistently engaged throughout, as those scenes do not drag the film, due to adding so much to the story and the characters. It is also one of those films that is very dark, unsettling, makes you feel dirty, watching it, and is really scary.

Speaking of characters, they're all very well developed, and it's made better by incredible acting. Emily Blunt gives an incredible female lead performance as Kate, who is shown to be a woman who hates violence, but is still brave and very persistent into getting the job done. Benicia del Toro and Josh Brolin play CIA agents and both are great in this film. Especially del Toro, who does an amazing job playing Alejandro Gillick, who may not seem very interesting at first, but as the film progresses, he not only gets more character developments, but this movie also takes many directions with this character. Josh Brolin, is not quite as good as Blunt or del Toro, but he is still really likable as Matt Graver, a character who is focused on his job, despite not caring about other people. The cast shares great chemistry, between each other.

The direction is perfect. Denis Villeneuve creates so much suspense to add to the story's unpredictability, and he gives one of the darkest feels to this film, perfectly capturing the lack of hope in the story. As a result, there are so many suspense scenes throughout, and the action is unbelievably thrilling, fro the incredible opening scene to the last shot of the film. The cinematography is also amazing, so amazing that I actually felt that I was in the film, due to it's realistic look.

Sicario is not only my favorite film of the year so far, but it is one of the best films released this decade that I have seen, so far. It is A film that I could not find a single flaw with. It is amazingly crafted, perfectly directed, and unsettling film, with its amazing, story, performances, characters, action, everything from beginning to end. This isn't a film that I'd recommend, if you don't like really dark stories, or strong violence, but it still an amazing masterpiece of a crime thriller.

FINAL VERDICT: A+ (MASTERPIECE)

Sicario ('Hitman' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future. To tell more would spoil what is a dense and complex storyline that evolves in a most satisfactory manner.

The acting is superb, with Blunt giving a career-best performance (sadly overlooked by the major awards), Josh Brolin being convincing as the war-weathered CIA man and Benicio del Toro delivering his best stone cold killer in gripping style. His Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination is well deserved, albeit for the maintenance of a fairly standard and chilling expression. Finally a name to watch for the future is London-born Daniel Kaluuya as Macer's black FBI colleague frustrated at being sidelined as a 'spare' by the task force. 

Equally praiseworthy is the epic cinematography of Roger Deakin ("Skyfall", "No Country for Old Men") which is also Oscar nominated. Remarkable landscapes of the Mexican border are supported by breathtaking helicopter/drone shots of the CIA convoy of black vehicles in one of the tenser moments in the film. Outstanding (for both direction, editing and cinematography) is a scene set in and around a tunnel that is the best satellite/night vision scene since the 'electronic battlefield' in "Patriot Games" in 1992.

The Oscar-nominated music by Jóhann Jóhannsson (so good with "The Theory of Everything") is of the atonal electronic variety, undoubtedly effective in conveying the film's mood but difficult to compare against the more obvious Oscar nominations from the likes of Ennio Morricone and John Williams.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve (who specialises in single named features) this is a tense, intelligent and thought-providing film that does nothing for Mexico's tourist industry but a lot for Trump's presidential campaign!

Often brutal, this is not an easy film to watch. But it is a highly intelligent watch, requiring your full attention throughout, and is deserving of a place among the best films of 2015. Recommended.

visceral drug trade thriller pulls no punches in its grim depiction of the cross-border traffic between Mexico and the States.

This time french-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who gave the viewers a kidnap drama suspense hit international movie "prisoners". Now coming back to screen with a action crime flick.

Emily Blunt takes the role of Kate Macer, an FBI field agent plunged in the powerful world of a drugs cartel as well as she trying to make her way to get a better rank for herself. She delineates perfectly the emotional conflicts of a woman working with violence and corruption on a daily basis.

*picks from trailer* The opening sequence in which rows of rotting corpses are found in a home in Arizona belonging to the cartel sets the tone for the helter skelter ride to follow in which Villeneuve sustains the knife-edge tension without a blip.

Nobody is who they seem to be, least of all Josh Brolin who suggests that he may be a defence contractor although Kate and her partner (Daniel Kaluuya) believes he may be from the CIA.

Also emerging from the shadows is Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro, an enigmatic figure who is the sicario of the title - in other words a hit-man whom you never where he is going to turn up next or on whose side he will be.

Although the violence is wince-inducing it is never gratuitous in the context of this particular world, where human beings are completely dispensable.

it's basically a great action thriller movie. A must see

Halfway through I wondered whether this might be a piece of experimental filmmaking to see whether its possible to maintain a lead character who has absolutely no agency whatsoever. It was afterwards, when I found out the script was by one of the bros behind Sons of Anarchy, where my having just sat through two hours of the only female character being ferried around by all the manly men whilst crying and asking what she should do next made perfect sense.

In terms of character development it's paper thin, and standard sexist tripe. Blunt's character's only moment of development is when we find out she hasn't had a boyfriend for years and hasn't been bothering to pluck her eyebrows. Del Toro's back-story turns out to be his need to avenge his wife and daughter's over the top murders. Yawn. Del Toro, to his credit, gives the best performance in the film, and reminded me of a manky Brad Pitt.

It's yet another male power fantasy, and a real waste of Emily Blunt's talents. After her great performance in Edge of Tomorrow I had been hoping for more butt kicking, but she literally does nothing in the whole film. The film could have almost made up for this, and had some kind of point to it, if it had allowed her a final moment of agency at the end by forcing Del Toro to kill her, but instead she just has another cry.

There are a couple of nicely made tense action sequences (involving the male characters of course), however they are lost in the dreary pacing of the rest of the film (I think the creators were aiming for prolonged artful suspense, but they failed).

Instead of watching this film I could have stayed home and done the dishes. As it is they are still piled up waiting for me. In an alternate universe they are done by now and I never wasted my time on this piece of garbage.

Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but I waited on and on for that special thing that made it deserve eight stars over here and win so much admiration all over the Internet, but it never arrives. Nothing special happened really.

Also, usually if they give a woman such a role they tend to show them as strong and smart, but it was hugely disappointing to see Kate literally play a cow, a weak, dumb woman who has nothing else to do except giving curious looks! She is in a sense irrelevant to the film, the story and everything undertaken by that FBI team. The only thing of note that she does is almost having sex with a person from the enemy group!

It gets one star for the beginning of this movie when it shocks you with people death and walled in to a house. The ending of that scene reduces a lot of the shock by not taking in the account of checking everything properly in such a big operation as this seems to be. This happens multiple times in the movie and I was really missing the technological advancement these sort of agency's usually have.

First half doesn't seem to matter cause in the middle everything gets switched and it turns into a revenge flick that also doesn't seem to make much sense. Especially the final scene is laughable because Del Toro's entry into this big mansion is so easy it is hard to explain that such an important cartel boss who could expect something like this is so unprotected. I would at least expect something along the lines like they did it in "scarface" with Al Pacino and that was way back in the 80's.

Emily Blunt,Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin all played roles way beneath their top roles in other movies and a lot of characters and the overall story were written poorly and only some set pieces stand out and therefor it gets another star.

I'm amazed I saw hints for a sequel and I don't even wanna think what that would be like knowing how stupid this one was and I will definitely pass on that one.

This is just to much of a mess to be called realistic or even entertaining and for me I am done with this and hope everyone involved will go on and do something better.

Will not go so far to not recommend this but I'll never watch it again.

If you get something good out of it,I'm happy for you.

But for me personally.....neh!

This is not an action movie, despite what the trailer suggested. However, even if you think of it as an drama-thriller type of movie you will be disappointed. Overall the movie makes no sense at all. The story is stupid and has no depth whatsoever to it. Despite some great scenes without cuts and good acting by some people this movie has nothing to offer. In my humble opinion good craftsmanship alone does not make a movie.

The character Emily Blunt plays is completely irrelevant in this movie. The role of this character could've been played by a manikin. Blunts acting is okish, but is ridiculed by the script. She has no influence on the story, just like the first Indiana Jones everything would've happened the way it did, even if Blunts character would not have existed in the first place. Instead of casting Blunt they should've went for a approach similar to "End of Watch".

The naivety of Blunts character is annoying to say the least, the story predictable without any twists.

The movie is perfect for people who watch it with an exact opinion about the US-Mexico drug trade derived problems and want to see their opinions endorsed.

Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.

SICARIO has the recipe for a delicious movie. You have the director of Prisoners, Benicio, Brolin, and a kick ass score. You provide drugs and a drug war - I am there. That being said, this movie has no climax and flat lines - another beautifully made clunker. The scenes waiver like a flounder off the coast of Baja.

Instead of ending with a strong finish, Sicario does the reverse. You're gripping your seat at the beginning. By the end, you want out and/or are praying for a fix. 

I might give Sicario a 6 because the director threw the right ingredients into the chicken and his direction (shots and performances) is spot on - unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a flimsy screenplay. I think this picture is on par with TRAFFIC (a movie that has great pieces but succumbs to the misguided written word). 

*SPOILER Personal opinion, I wish the Emily Blunt character was casted with a dude. The female portrayal by the writer is like a Clarice Starling on a bad batch of Tylenol PM.

Josh Brolin must have lit the script on fire when asked to memorize one line. He improvises to such an extent, I started wondering if he knew the plot of the movie. Thank God he had some semblance of an interesting character to work with - I think he's enjoyable to watch.

This is no fault of his own but due to circumstance. But, seeing Benicio in another drug flick is like seeing another Volkswagen Jetta with skis on the roof.

The movie is slow and pure drama. There are better plots and story lines that can be created to present how a drug lord is shot dead and how a tunnel is found. 

I fail to find tension in the movie. It isn't an intelligent movie as it lacks the phenomenon of suspense that many thrillers and drama movies create. The visual effects and camera angles are poor at many times. There is hardly any use of technology besides the "drone" which is a let down for a movie projecting law enforcement in their fight against drugs.

Emily Blunt - one of her worst roles ever. She performs well but is more of a lackluster character. As an FBI agent she surprisingly has no physical strength or mental toughness. Her FBI partner is an unnecessary addition to the movie budget. 

There are better movies to watch.

Of the nearly 400 films being showcased at this year's Toronto  International Film Festival (TIFF), Denis Villeneuve's Sicario was the  one film at the top of my 'Must See' list. Having premiered at this  year's Cannes Film Festival where it went on to be nominated for the  prestigious Palme D'Or, Sicario stars Emily Blunt, Joh Brolin and  Benicio Del Toro as members of a government task force who attempt to  apprehend a villainous drug lord.  
Director Denis Villeneuve is on some kind of roll. His previous films   Polytechnique, Incendies and Prisoners  were all thought provoking  character pieces offset by realistic and graphic depictions of  violence. Sicario opens with just such a scene as Blunt's Kate Macer  leads a rain on a Mexican drug house near Phoenix, Arizona and  discovers dozens of executed victims packed into the walls. Audiences  will have barely settled in their seats and scrunched on but a handful  of popcorn kernels when the shocking revelation is revealed on screen.  
From here, Macer is forced to work with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and  Alejandro (Del Toro) who works as a sort of fixer on both sides of the  border. Their work leads them to drug trafficker Fausto (Julio Cesar  Cedillo) and the group then works to transport the criminal back across  the border. Their journey will be met with many obstacles with  shoot-outs at border crossings and a tense hunt and shoot inside a drug  trafficking tunnel connecting the two countries.  
The focus of Sicario (which is Mexican slang for 'hitman') is clearly  on Blunt's lead character and Blunt is up to the task in being the  smartest person in the room while also being the one most left in the  dark as to the team's objectives. She will be continually conflicted by  her male peers particularly their penchant for instigating or  responding forcefully to appeared violence. The action settled between  Macer's first-hand education thrust the film forward to a very  satisfying and acceptable conclusion.  
The supporting cast is equally engrossing particularly Del Toro who  will be on screen for most all of the film's most memorable shots. Del  Toro's character is clouded in mystery and unclear motives and Del Toro  gives his best performance since Traffic. 
Sicario was penned by Taylor Sheridan who played Deputy Chief Hale on  FX's Sons of Anarchy. His take on the war on drugs and the violence and  human costs that surround the battle are dead on target. The realism  results in Sicario being hardly the crowd-pleaser. It is a bleak and  grim film that might just be Villeneuve's best work to date.  
The photography by Roger Deakins is stunning. Expect Deakins to garnish  another Academy Award nomination for his efforts here to go with his  work on The Shawshank Redemption and Skyfall.  
Also worthy of note is the music by Jóhann Jóhannsson that grabs you by  the balls while the action unfolds.  
Sicario might be too bleak for Academy voters, but make no mistake of  Sicario's impact and brilliance. It was on my 'Must See' list for a  reason and did not disappoint. Easily the best film of the year so far.

Spoilers Ahead:

Everyone is all over Blunt, she won my admiration. I was very hard on her for Angel Of Verdun, here she does what great actresses and actors always do: choose a role that shows their humanity. I admired her for taking a role that shows her in over her head, in a war that observes no rules. Del Toro steals the movie with his quiet malevolence, want to appreciate it more? Watch Face Off, he does not walk in slow motion, jacket waving behind him to a bass guitar. Alejandro, from his first scene, at the front of the private plane, is a mystery we want to unravel with Kate. After a truly creepy beginning, with dead people in the walls of the house, at the drug bust, Kate is drawn into a nightmare based upon her quixotic naiveté about the Drug War. She stands at the table while Matt, and the rest of the government big shots, deftly bend her idealism against her. She tragically says,"Will I get a chance to get the people who did what happened today?" Notice Matt's glance over at the others, with the barely controlled smile, after a long pause he says she will. We look through her eyes as she goes on a perilous mission to bring back a drug lord, from Mexico, for interrogation. The rules begin bending almost immediately which greatly perturbs her. I am a conservative, as you can tell by the religious Icon, but please, anyone familiar with Iran / Contra cannot claim the CIA isn't up to its neck in drugs. Remember the man with the world's worst memory in the hearings? 

Everyone has their own agenda, just like real life. We hear Brolin's agenda, near the very end when he snaps at Kate,"Look, this is the best we can do until 20 million people quit snorting and smoking this crap." Kate discovers, to her horror, that she is helping Alejandro re-establish the Medellion dominance, plus settle a personal vendetta. This is the core of this movie: disillusionment. Not only does she get her eyes opened but for the rest of her life she will be looking over her shoulder. I see many attacked the lack of action scenes; true, but the first showing you will not know this. There are pop out moments, the intensity is palpable. Lots of creeping in tunnels, fields, mostly at night. Why do I say it is non-PC? Because Blunt has the bravery to play a role where she isn't a Kung Fu master, firearm expert or master of high flying gymnastics. She is an existential stand in for the audience; her helplessness, with Alejandro bailing her butt out, reflects our feelings of powerlessness in confronting this giant, out of control mess. The complexity of the characters, no pure good or pure evil, even Alejandro is not all bad, this is a sign of good writing. 

The best scene is where he is behind her in her apartment, he says,"You look like a little girl when you are afraid." He kindly proffers the lying document that says they obeyed all of our laws, please sign here. Watch how quickly he changes but not theatrically. He calmly says,"Kate, please, you would be committing suicide." He gently puts the 9mm under her chin, this is what I mean. The movie reminds me of that old classic The Friends Of Eddie Coyle; there is such verisimilitude with the characters. Nobody can be trusted, everybody has their own vector, and they couldn't give a crap about her. Alejandro saves her but that doesn't stop him from almost shooting her if she gets in his way. I love that little scene with the Delta Force leader; she asks him nicely what she should do, he responds,"Point your damn gun at the ground and don't shoot any of my GD men." It is said with complete contempt and disgust. All the great actors and actresses of the past, before the advent of our 'little red books' of PC, were not afraid to portray human weakness, fear or lacking in intelligence. About ten years ago, you get what you see in the new Star Wars: it is a woman, so she must be a Master Jedi, mechanic, pilot and speak Wookie: it is so painfully absurd. Also, I might add, it is sexist, in that it is patronizing to women: here, we drew you like this so you feel better. When we can't tell the difference, in how we are treated or delineated, that is equality. 

I hear the objections to the villain's indictment of our government, no, they didn't train the cartels to cut heads off but, believe me, read a history of the Iran / Contra drug store the CIA was running under Reagan, he isn't off by much. Reached my limit, sorry, this is one good movie that proves Crappywood can make a non-cartoon movie if they but try. A Real Exceptionaly Good Movie. Q.E.D.

I found this movie quite enjoyable and captivating. Every moment lent its part to the story which by the way, was quite well written. Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are the star actors for me. They all play key roles and deliver beautifully on their parts.

Having read the other comments especially those that rated it poorly for various reasons, I would love to address those I can:

1)Poorly written story/not up to potential: On the contrary, the story did exactly what it was meant to do..People who watch movies through genre-specific lenses would be disappointed of course.. I do not, instead I just follow the story plot step by step and watch it unravel.. They did an excellent job here keeping the viewer guessing what the objective could be until it finally unravels at the end. This made the movie a lot more interesting for me..

The dead bodies in the walls of the house that was raided at the beginning and the headless corpses hanging off the bridge are pointing to the same thing.. 'The grim nature of a drug cartel run world..' end-of!! To make or expect anything more of it is to your own peril..

2)Character of Emily Blunt (Kate) was useless: What?? Then such a viewer did not get the story. Again the very well written story supplied us with all the necessary details.. Kate (FBI agent) and her partner where recruited/needed to legitimize the operation of the CIA within that region.. 

Secondly, Kate was the typical idealist from the black and white world where she reigned as something of a star.. Throwing her into the larger and darker world where the lines of good and evil are not well defined but rather a blurry mess of gray matter.. gives the viewer the opportunity to see the collision of these two worlds and the effect it has on the key players.. 

True to her nature, Kate fails to realize when she is out of her depth; she fails to adapt.. even after her boss Jennings advises her to do so but in her small mindedness with little or no understanding tries to stamp her self-importance on the circumstance she finds herself in. However she is completely and expertly knocked-out.. Oh what a joy!! It is precious to see her character give in to defeat when she lowers the gun she has pointed at Alejandro at the end.. The disaster here would have been if the story gave her character some kind of triumph in her misguided quest for justice.. That would have been unrealistic and irritating.. 

This is the reason for Kate's character, to present us with the dichotomy between the small fairy-tale land of rules and the much larger and darker land of the wolves..

This is a must watch!!!
