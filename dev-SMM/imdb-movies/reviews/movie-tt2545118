### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Without a doubt Blackfish is one of the most horrific theatre experiences you'll have this year. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents a very carefully constructed case on the effects of inhumane treatment of Orcas in captivity. The one-sided argument is that the untimely human deaths caused by captive Orcas were not their fault but rather the fault of their captors; SeaWorld, and the evidence proving this point is so disturbing and so shockingly obvious that it's no wonder SeaWorld refused to be interviewed.

The story centers on Tilikum, a 12,000 lbs. Orca that is directly responsible for the death of 3 people, including Dawn Brancheau the former senior trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando. The film explores the reasoning behind the likely "psychosis" Tilikum has experienced in captivity, and the disgusting cover up executives have tried to make.

While SeaWorld naturally refused to be interviewed, the films perspective mostly derives from former trainers/employees of SeaWorld and other various experts. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking. Presenting the theory, the evidence and finally a solution to the topic at hand, Blackfish is a marvellous story that will have you as tearful as the trainers that sincerely care for the well being of the creatures.

Blackfish doesn't just show a bunch of disgruntled former employees bashing SeaWorld either. The greatest technique employed in this film is its use of footage from shows featuring these trainers when they were younger. There's something so mesmerizing about watching the smiling young trainers play with their best friend while hearing their older self reminisce in voice over. Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.

While we've always known Orca's are intelligent creatures Cowperthwaite dedicates a lot of the film to demonstrating their capacity for emotions as well; watching them over time build connections with their trainers and each other. So by the time they show us their capture and captivity and witness the pain felt the whales, Tilikum especially, we know that their violent behavior is a direct result of SeaWorld. Killer Whales having never harmed a human in the wild.

I want to go through every point made by the movie but I won't. You need to see this for yourselves. The facts aren't what drive this film, the emotion behind them do. This is one of those movies you just won't stop talking about, and for the subject matter that's the best compliment it can receive. In the end sharing this information is what's going to help these Orcas.

Between the gripping footage and the distressing stories Blackfish effectively proves its point. There are very few movies like this; a must-see. There is no way after seeing this movie that you'll ever want to go to SeaWorld again, and for the sake of the animals that's the only thing we can do for them. Since it's made quite clear; the only thing affecting their decision-making is: how many Shamu dolls and tickets they've sold.

Our Rating:10/10

Let's go to the theme park to see the Orcas. Playful, interacting with their trainers who swim with them carefree it is a guaranteed spectacle and fun time.

Do we ever consider, that these intelligent creatures spent a lifetime enclosed in a large bathtub so that we can be entertained? Imagine going to see a show of children ballerinas knowing that those children spent their entire lives locked up in a room when not performing. Would anyone stand for this? Surely not, I would hope.

This riveting and didactic documentary explores the owner's attitudes when occasionally those animals flip out and act in an aggressive way. It is always the trainers fault, or the bad manners of the animals. In fact, it appears that those who run those theme parks have gone out of their way to hide the truth which is those who work with killer whales are in great risk.

The death of a long-time and renowned trainer brought the issue to the surface where enquiries had to be made.

We might be better informed about the risks involved but the rather lax legislature regarding animal rights allows these companies to still operate and oppress animals in an inhuman way.

Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism.

The documentary "Blackfish" just premiered at Sundance to much deserved rave reviews. It's a compelling story of a 12,000 pound orca who has been in captivity since 1983 when he was captured at the age of two. New footage and interviews with trainers who worked at SeaWorld (and left disillusioned) add dynamic interest to the overall question of whether or not these wild intelligent sentient animals should be kept in captivity. This is a story that will have you questioning what you thought you knew. See "Blackfish" if you're interested in orcas; see it if you're interested in the truth; see it for no other reason than to find out why SeaWorld doesn't want you to see it. This film moves with the fluidity of a wild orca in the ocean. Don't miss out on seeing "Blackfish" because it's going to change the way you think.

I saw this documentary at the Sundance film festival London. I travelled down from Manchester as i could not wait for the Uk cinema release. After Seeing The Cove in 2009 after swimming with Captive Dolphins myself in 2006 to get over a family bereavement x 2. I never knew what dolphins did in captivity - just that it was one of the things i wanted to do before i die. After seeing them entertain people again & again, eat dead fish & float in a small tank all day i needed to see the pain Orcas go through. I'm glad Blackfish has been made. YOU need to see this film if you love mammals & any other intelligent animal in captivity...My eyes were opened at The Cove....if this doesn't then you are very selfish....Money is defo the Rule of all Evil. I will be taking all my friends & family to see this. After 5 days I am still thinking about it & can't believe these parks are still open :(

This is a thought-provoking documentary on Tilikum, an Orca that has been at Sea World since 1983 and who is responsible for the death of 3 people (2 of his trainers, and 1 man who snuck into his tank). This is a film about the horrors that these animals go through being kept in captivity for our pleasure and the latest film to showcase how horrible Sea World can be for the very animals it claims to protect, oh the irony.

If you thought watching 'The Cove' was difficult, I suggest you take tissues if you plan on seeing this. 2 days later and I still can't stop thinking about this movie or get rid of some of the images and sounds shown.

I highly recommend this doc. Go see it with an open mind, I guarantee that you will never see captivity the same way again.

Greetings again from the darkness. Dogs, cats, fish, birds, hamsters, ferrets, snakes, and even pigs. We love our pets. We also love our zoos, city aquariums and SeaWorld parks. For many years, we have chosen to believe that the research and educational advances that come from these outlets outweigh any of the negatives involved with keeping wild animals in captivity. Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite shows us (by focusing on SeaWorld) that it's way past time for us to open our eyes to the cruelty involved with the capture and training of wild animals for entertainment purpose.

The points made here are not speculation. We witness numerous interviews with "former" SeaWorld trainers. It's clear these people thought they had a bond with their co-performers. Most never even mention the term "killer whale" ... the common moniker for the majestic creatures better known as Orcas. The interviews have great impact, and when combined with startling TV news clips and footage from audience members, it becomes obvious that the huge profits and entertainment offered to families, are quite frankly generated by an immoral and inexcusable business model.

Most of the story is tied together by the 2010 death of super-trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum, the largest Orca in the SeaWorld group. What we soon learn is that Tilikum was captured in Iceland waters at the age of three, and has since had many incidents resulting in injuries and even three deaths. It's also stated that Tilikum is the head of the family tree for the majority of SeaWorld's performing Orcas.

Of course, no one can or should blame these incredibly intelligent and emotional and family-oriented creatures. Everything about their existence goes against their natural habitat and way of life. The real issue is ... just because we CAN capture and train these animals, does that mean we SHOULD? If the focus is profits, then the answer is apparently yes. If instead, the focus is respecting nature and valuing other species, then the answer is much different.

The Cove and Project Nim are two other documentaries that come to mind when thinking about filmmakers attempting to expose the danger in training wild animals. Watching this story had me hanging my head like the fisherman from the 1970's as he helped capture a young whale, as the family members swam nearby crying and screeching. Let's hope director Cowperthwaite's screams are heard. See this movie before deciding to visit another SeaWorld (who couldn't be bothered to comment on camera). There are better ways to teach your kids about nature and there are certainly less cruel forms of entertainment.

In February 2010, reports of the accidental death of a killer whale trainer, Dawn Brancheau, at SeaWorld, Orlando featured in newspapers and TV bulletins across the globe. How could such a tragedy occur? What on earth was Brancheau thinking? How could she make such a silly mistake? Then the story changed and it appeared this very experienced trainer was attacked by the orca, Tilikum. Shockwaves rippled. What? A gentle giant killed a human that cared for it? Suddenly killer whales lived up to their fearsome moniker and became the villains of the moment.

Then the story changed again and the truth began to emerge 

Blackfish is a startling documentary from Gabriela Cowperthwaite that investigates the reality behind the sparkling waters and bright lights of the SeaWorld parks, not that they are alone in their mistreatment of these startling, intelligent, beautiful creatures. She trawls through the archives to reveal that Brancheau's death was neither a freak accident nor an isolated attack from a vicious animal, but just one of many examples since humans decided it was acceptable to kidnap young orcas for the pleasure and pockets of humans. Kidnap? Is such a strong word appropriate? Watch Blackfish, listen to the mother make "sounds we've never heard an orca make before" in a harrowing display of grief and then decide.

Watching Blackfish and still choosing to visit SeaWorld or another such aquatic zoo is surely on the same level as taking your kids to McDonalds even though you know you're poisoning them. If I were reviewing the subject of Blackfish, like 2009's powerfully distressing The Cove, it would surely warrant a perfect score. Upon the evidence here, even if you've chosen not to see the truth of our actions in the past, there's no contest. It's wrong, it's unacceptable, it's a despicable thing we do when we steal these creatures from their oceans and trap them in tiny prisons. But the review is not for the subject matter but for the manner in which it is presented to us.

Blackfish isn't perfect. It doesn't have quite the same profound, lasting impact as The Cove. Perhaps that is, in part, down to the lack of shocking imagery. The footage of orcas bleeding copiously into their pools, having been attacked by other killer whales, is sickening but because it is on a smaller scale than the mass slaughter of dolphins that dyed the cove scarlet there is a risk the impact will be reduced. It shouldn't be, it mustn't be, but We shouldn't need to see it to believe it, but we've become a far more visually inspired breed in recent years.

More than that, Blackfish doesn't give a lot of time to the other side of the story. I'm intrigued to know quite how SeaWorld could possibly defend its actions but, as they declined to be interviewed, this is a very one-sided documentary. I can't help thinking this imperative cause would be even more compelling if we could hear the excuses.

Another unexplained mystery is how Cowperthwaite obtained the footage she has of SeaWorld. Presumably they didn't give it to her willingly. But these are minor quibbles with a documentary that is as sickening as it is compelling. Interviews with apologetic, horrified former SeaWorld trainers and tear-streaked 'kidnappers' impart the information we need to educate, inform, convince or perhaps even convert us.

First, Cowperthwaite teaches us about the orcas: Their brains are superior to ours in certain aspects; their emotional attachment far exceeds ours, with offspring remaining with their mother long into adulthood; each family group (or pod) has it's own culture and 'language' for communication.

She then counters that with the lies perpetuated by the SeaWorld staff that we choose to believe: Orcas live longer, up to 35 years, in captivity due to the care available  actually, in the wild, it's up to 50 for males and can be closer to a hundred for the females.

Male dorsal fin collapse is normal  absolutely, it's 100% in captivity. However, in their natural environment it occurs approximately 1% of the time.

Killer whales enjoy performing the tricks in tiny pools for us  um 

As more and more evidence of orca psychosis brought on by cruelty and captivity unfolds, Blackfish becomes increasingly difficult to watch. The sight of peeling paint in a tiny, floating warehouse into which the orcas are herded every night is saddening. Hearing that they are punished for not performing perfectly is horrifying. Watching them bleed, observing them rock in grief or cry out to their stolen offspring is heartbreaking.

The message throughout Blackfish is that faceless managers steal killer whales (along with dolphins and countless other creatures) from their natural habitats, subject them to abuse and solitary confinement in woefully cramped enclosures so that we can pay to watch them perform unnatural tricks for our cameras, and so the owners can watch their bank accounts swell. The message is, it isn't about entertainment or protection of a species, it's about money.

But what stamps the reality more indelibly than anything that comes before it, is the comment from one of the former trainers in the final scene. As they sail through the ocean, watching a pod of killer whales free and at peace in their natural environment, he comments, "We saw orcas swimming in straight lines with straight dorsal fins... it was an honour."

First, that's a great documentary: it beautifully combines Herzog's "Grizzly Man" thrilling, escalating tension of how things go wrong when humans misinterpret their relation with nature with Achbar & Abbott's "The Corporation" sharp examination of modern-day companies.

Second, it is aesthetically captivating and pleasant to follow. Cowperthwaite's reconstructs the narrative leading to the final, and fatal, encounter of Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau, alternating footage, both in the wild and in aquariums, with interviews and contextual data. 

Finally, it is a work that, without ever abandoning neutrality, serves a mostly noble cause: that against the confinement of animals that are intelligent, social, and set to crisscross oceans, not to be kept in tanks.

My hope is that, by being such a fine piece of art, it also helps change the industry of marine-life entertainment theme parks.

So "Blackfish" is a big splash in more than one way! Go watch it.

This year is already shaping up to be a great one for documentaries and Blackfish is quickly earning the reputation of being the most essential. And it absolutely deserves it. Although its an emotionally charged argument, there's a rational logic behind it. Every time there's found footage of killer whale incidents it's utterly gut-wrenching and you can't help but dread the moments that inevitably shook the world when they could've been prevented. Fortunately, the filmmakers find a different way to present the footage each time and it keeps it from feeling repetitive and builds to feeling more heart breaking at every turn. In its use of talking head interviews with former trainers, it ends up genuinely dramatic without feeling melodramatic as many documentaries can. It oozes with passion for the creatures which helps enforce its argument against their treatment, not just for better protection for trainers, but for corporations like SeaWorld to not turn a blind eye at the clear injustice they've cased. What's the moral cost of the business and entertainment? I certainly won't ever be able to be entertained by animal acts without thinking about Blackfish. Thisis an extremely powerful documentary that's brilliantly structured, tragic and cinematic. More than worth your time.

I am so happy the cruelty behind captive whales is being exposed. I was so excited to see this promo on IMDb. Seeing the 20 seconds of the whales being taken from the ocean and then where they kept them after made me want to cry. I doubt I'll be able to watch the movie without crying. What Sea World and other theme parks like them are doing is wrong and cruel and I'm so glad more people are going to see this. Every parent who takes their kid to Sea World should be required to watch this first. I went to Sea World twice for school functions in high school and I didn't think anything of it. When I look back on it, I am mad that I was put in the position to have to go. I hope this film also changes schools views on field trips (or band trips or drill team trips) to Sea World. I have been fighting and protesting Sea World (and the circus)for years now. The more people who know about what really happens the better for these poor animals. THANK YOU to the person who made this documentary.

As I watched this extremely thought-provoking documentary I was reminded of the recent film Project Nim. In the latter we were shown the tragic consequences of people deciding to bring a chimpanzee up as a human. The basic message of this incredible documentary was that if you bring a wild and dangerous animal into an artificial world populated by people, be prepared for some repercussions. Blackfish, likewise, has a very similar message. Except in this example the outcome is far worse. Not only do we see animals mistreated but some of the very people who love them most end up dead. There aren't many winners in this one.

The story is underpinned by the death of a trainer. In 2010 Dawn Brancheau was killed in SeaWorld in Orlando by a killer whale called Tilikum. This in and of itself is a pretty horrible event but it's what was discovered with a little research that takes the horror up to a new level. It turned out that the same whale had in fact killed another trainer back in 1991 in very similar circumstances and had shown aggressive behaviour to trainers on other occasions. There were a few other near misses with orcas dragging trainers underwater in this water park but, worse still, there was a further killing in a park in Spain that obtained its whales from SeaWorld; whales that were the offspring of Tilikum. As if this was not appalling enough, to rub salt in the wounds, SeaWorld attempted to put the blame on the trainers, as if they were in some way responsible for their deaths. Eye witnesses were never asked for evidence in the '91 death despite their account of the tragedy conflicting with the SeaWorld version of events (incredibly, 'drowning'), while the eye witnesses in the 2010 case countered the official line from SeaWorld leading to a court case. What comes out of all of this loud and clear is that when it comes to SeaWorld, money is prioritised over the welfare of the animals and the safety of the trainers. It makes you angry and makes you wonder how these parks have not been shut down. Needless to say, SeaWorld refused to be interviewed for this documentary.

These killings are terrible events but no one is blaming the orcas. These animals, who are used to roaming the oceans in large family groups which they never leave, are stuck in small pools performing tricks. It would be unusual if creatures with such highly developed brains with emotional capabilities did not develop forms of psychosis in this environment. In one very upsetting part of the film one of the female whales has her calf removed from her permanently on the basis that it was interfering with the performances for the paying public. The mother whale remained in a corner of the pool for a very long time crying out with a sound no one had ever heard before. The animal was clearly in extreme grief. Is it acceptable that people are allowed to do this to such an emotionally developed creature? We take them from the seas away from their families; surely there should be a moral responsibility? But there isn't. There is even one unpleasant moment from 1970 captured on film where a calf is captured and removed from its family. The other orcas did not flee, they hung around and cried. It was pretty awful and even one of the hunters was traumatised by this event.

This is a film that really should be seen. Particularly if you are thinking of taking a trip to see the performing killer whales and those dedicated folks who work with them.

I have never been a fan of zoos. Watching caged animals pace back and forth neurotically has always bothered me. I must confess we took our kids to Seaworld when they were young. One time was immediately after one orca had killed another in the tank so there was basically no show, the orcas just swam around in the tank because the trainers couldn't get in the water with them. Watching this movie is deeply disturbing. It is cruel to see what these highly intelligent animals are forced to endure. The scene where the mother and baby are separated is heart-wrenching. First, watch this movie. Then, don't ever go to a zoo or sea aquarium again and this will cease to exist.

Having spent the majority of my Summer holidays as a small child bouncing from theme parks to zoos all over America and the UK, I never really thought about animals in captivity being cruel until I was older.

I already had a solid opinion on this subject before I watched Blackfish so my world view didn't really shift, it was merely justified. I can guarantee though that if you have a positive opinion on wildlife in captivity (specifically large mammals like Orca's) or never really thought about it, this documentary will open your eyes.

Blackfish really hits hard early on showing exactly what Seaworld, and other large corporations with animals, have done in the past to gain their animals. 

Blackfish is full of heartbreak and I think a large part of the efficiency of this documentary is the expert editing and decisions taken by production of where to place the clips and when. The interviews were fantastic and having a slightly contradictory interviewee made the documentary even better.

I highly recommend this to everyone although be aware that this is definitely a 15 and it includes some shocking video clips of trainers getting hurt, animals bleeding and high tension.

"Blackfish" is one of the greatest films to come along in a decade. The details and research of the never before seen reporting of what goes into making a massive intelligent whale perform tricks in a pool will forever change you. The film calls into question the very moral and ethical considerations of stripping away every normal and natural behavior to Orcas for our entertainment, and the devastating consequences of doing so for both people and the animals. Every person who is considering visiting Sea World or any Marine Park must see this film first. The shiny and fun show your kids might enjoy has a very dark and disturbing reality behind it. This movie marks the beginning of the end of keeping Orcas captive. It would be insanity to continue the confinement of Orcas for human entertainment now that the dirty secrets of Sea World have been made public. The animals do not matter to Sea World, only the profits. This movie causes great emotional pain as it exposes the worst traits of man. Blackfish is a must see film.

This documentary is one of the best docs I've ever seen. Tilikum, the Orca who is the film's focus, is not the only tragic victim in this movie. We feel the loss of Dawn Brancheau & the other trainers killed in this movie acutely.

There are scenes of wild orcas that are rapturous & conversely there are scenes with them that are filled with tension & dread. The filmmakers aren't out to shock you with graphic imagery (if any exist). The spoken & written descriptions are horrifying enough. (It is not for children!) I wish I could un-hear the plaintive cries of a mother orca after being separated from her child. That scene had to be in the film, but it is almost --it is-- too much.

To call this film one-sided is like calling a film about the horrors of meth addiction, child abuse or the dangers of cigarette smoking biased. How could it be any other way?

It is an absolutely unforgettable film.

Update 2015: This film is even more powerful if you see it after you had read John Hargrove's book "Beneath The Surface" which explores the film's subject in greater detail. I can't think of a film + book that complement each other so perfectly except maybe "Eight Men Out" & "Into The Wild" (maybe Cheryl Strayed's "Wild" which I haven't read that was adapted into an excellent film).

Great documentary its really informative and engaging, I did not feel that at any point that it being repetitive like some documentaries can be. 

I always thought about animals in captivity and how it was bad for them but after I watched Blackfish it really opened my eye to a whole new level of cruelty that all animals in captivity suffer.

It is a shame that the trainers had to learn the hard way the meaning behind the Killer Whales name. I was really surprised how even the trainers were kept in the dark for so long about Tilliky.

It is a nice and sobering documentary that encompasses all forms of animal captivity.

This is an excellent film for families, and everyone to watch. If you love Orcas/killer whales, PLEASE watch this movie. This movie has truly changed my life, I have made everyone in my family watch it, and plan to continue to share it with anyone who will listen. It is heart wrenching, breathtaking, horrifying, yet honest. It tells the truth behind how they were caught from the ocean, they were not rescued and taken to sea world, they were captured. They were ripped from their families and some were killed during the process. It also shares a lot of details about their lifespan, former trainers experiences, and more. This movie will make you cry, but also helps you appreciate the beauty and intelligence of killer whales. Please watch this film & share with everyone you know.

Blackfish as a documentary is a clear and comprehensive introduction to the world of captive orcas, their trainers, and the human tragedies that have made businesses like SeaWorld increasingly controversial. The film makes good use of interviews and archival footage, though without the participation of SeaWorld, it is understandably one-sided. However, it's SeaWorld's refusal to participate that says it all: there is not much a SeaWorld representative can say that doesn't make a bigger fool of the corporation than it has already made of itself.

The film succeeds in covering all bases--it begins with the naive perspectives of the trainers but spends equal time on the life stories of the orcas, who were captured at young ages and stolen from their families. It's hard not to be affected by the intelligence and depth of orcas and orca communities; many of the scenes, especially where mother orcas grieve their babies' capture, are heartbreaking. All along, it documents several "accidents" where orcas in captivity have injured or killed humans. While upsetting, the filmmakers make it clear that this is a consequence of humans keeping these intelligent, strong animals in captivity.

Without a doubt, SeaWorld comes off as the villain here. It repeatedly covers up whale attacks and usually finds ways to blame them on the trainers. It also continues to use Tilikum, the whale who was involved in the deaths of three humans, in its shows. The whole time, it prizes money over the safety of the human trainers or the whales. Anyone who has fond memories of SeaWorld will probably not think of it in the same way after watching this documentary.

That is the main importance of this film: to open up the naive public's eyes to what is undoubtedly animal cruelty. For this viewer, who paid a lot of attention to the media at the time of Dawn Brancheau's death and read up quite a bit on the subject of captive orcas, none of this was new or surprising. Few things are covered particularly in-depth. It is definitely a primer to the issue, and will probably leave people wanting to know more.

People have accused the film of being one sided. Well, considering that Sea World declined to be interviewed for the film, it is kind of hard for the filmmakers to be balanced. And the main character is unable to speak for himself. A previous reviewer stated that this film will not win any Oscars but it is eligible for the best documentary Oscar and CNN which aired it on it's network is increasing it's visibility. Tilikum, a 12,000 pound orca who is responsible for 3 deaths over 20 years is the main focus of the film. I had the pleasure 20 years ago while whale watching off the coast of Orange County, California of encountering 2 wild orcas. This was pure happenstance, we were looking for the Grey whale. Seeing these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat with the erect dorsal fin standing as tall as a man was a humbling experience. But in captivity you are stifling the animals natural instincts, You can't deny 65 million years of evolution. If the film does win the Oscar and I predict it will, hopefully it will change peoples views and be a force for change. This is one of the best films of the year documentary or otherwise.Update 2015-Sea World saw a drop on attendance at all of it's parks after the release of the film. A number of Rock and Roll artists cancelled performance at the parks in protest. In November of 2015 Sea World announce plans to end Orca shows at it's San Diego park. So the film has had a substantial impact. It is probably one of the most influential documentaries in history. It is more relevant now in light of these recent event.

When my children were young, we went to the killer whale (orca) shows at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was fun to see the 8,000+ pound whales doing tricks for the trainer while the audience was being splashed. We gave little thought, however, to how the whales felt about it. Today, millions who attend SeaWorld shows watching the killer whales perform in San Diego, Orlando, and San Antonio also pay little heed to either the danger to the trainers or the frustration of the animals that have been confined to an area the size of a swimming pool for up to twenty or thirty years. These conditions are depicted in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's hard-hitting and extremely disturbing documentary Blackfish, the name given to orcas by the First Nations.

While the film provides no new information, putting it all together makes a powerful case against the whales' confinement. Interviewed are former Sea World trainers who do not hesitate to talk about the misinformation they were told to tell audiences about orcas' lifespan and fins (which routinely collapse in captivity) and the great benefit whales experience at SeaWorld. According to the former trainers, the killer whales are social creatures that live with their families all of their life. When they are forced to separate in order to "introduce new breeding options to other SeaWorld parks and by fulfilling entertainment and other husbandry needs," their heartbreaking cry simulated in the film will stay with you.

Trainers and whale experts talk about the intelligence and beauty of these animals and how they can live many years longer in the wild. According to Biologist Debbie Giles, in the wild, their estimated maximum life span is 60-70 years for males and 80-90 years for females. In captivity, most orcas die in their teens and 20s and only a handful have made it past 35. The former SeaWorld trainers also talk about the whales' aggressive behavior directed against each other when they are subjected to overcrowding. The film centers on a particular whale, the 12,000 pound Tilikum, who has been involved with the deaths of three SeaWorld trainers since 1991, events captured on amateur home video.

Beginning in 1983 as a two-year-old, Tilikum performed at the Sealand of the Pacific Park in Victoria, B.C., where he was jammed into a holding area along with two other female whales each night when the park closed. This abuse continued until the inevitable occurred when a trainer was killed in 1991 with Tilikum's participation, though he did not instigate the attack. After the incident, the owner mercifully closed the park and Tilikum was shipped to SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Although SeaWorld said that the whale would only be used for breeding purposes, he continued to be part of the show and continues to this day.

This in spite of the fact that another death occurred in 1999 when a man evaded security to enter the park at night, and in 2010 when a highly-skilled senior trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was mauled to death by a whale she had a long-term relationship with, an incident SeaWorld attributed to "trainer error." In discussing these attacks, the film asserts that no attacks against humans have been documented when the orcas are in their natural habitat, swimming hundreds of miles each day in the open seas (though some sources claim there have been two). In 2006, however, ABC reported that there had been nearly two dozen attacks in captivity worldwide. Recently a judge, recognizing the potential danger to trainers, ordered SeaWorld to place a barrier between the trainers and the whales. SeaWorld is appealing.

Though Blackfish is one-sided and aggressive in its advocacy, SeaWorld was given an opportunity to present its case but declined, calling Blackfish "inaccurate and misleading." Cowperthwaite said that she approached her documentary as a journalist with an open mind and that her point in making the film was not to shut down SeaWorld but to provide the context for humane treatment for the whales and to prevent additional deaths at marine theme parks. "The film is a truthful document," she says, and SeaWorld is "an industry based on fairy tales." Since the documentary's release, entertainer Willie Nelson, and rock groups Heart and Barenaked Ladies have cancelled shows at SeaWorld in protest.

Perhaps a little preachy, but essentially right-on expose' of one of the nastier roadside zoo type companies around. 

Sea World was shown the door in Washington because of the numbers of whales they killed trying to capture a few for their parks.

As against elephants or ostriches or other exotics, killer whales are fairly easy to see in their natural environment. All you have to do is come to where they like to hang out and go out on a whale watch boat.

Sea World, if it were responsibly run, might have a case for what it's doing now as long as it doesn't trap any more wild animals. But the spin, the bullshit and outright false information, shows that their chief interest is in the almighty buck, not taking care of wildlife or even their own staff. 

Sea World seems to be continuing a vestige of old-fashioned zoo attitudes that once gave us bears in chains dancing at county fairs, especially when they confine these animals to such small enclosures. It may be true that animals born in captivity know nothing of life in the wild, but they're still physically equipped for that life, and can and should be returned to the wild.

This is not because we can do that, but because we should, just as we should be about cleaning up our act so there's enough fish for these creatures to eat. In the wild.

In the beginning and toward the end of the film there are local Washington state shots, even one that shows one well-known bull, "Ruffles," and others of his pod in their natural environment, one I can almost look at directly (but for the trees) from where I sit writing this. 

So if Se World wants to do this right, assuming it can be done "right," it wouldn't cost any more money (their basic value) to tell the truth and offer good solid scientific information, instead of making it all into one more consumerist game.

Founded in 1964 by Milton C. Shedd, Ken Norris and David DeMott, Sea World was the newest theme park attraction in the 60's. It was a theme park attraction that was different for the 60's and even now due to it's marine life theme. From it's popular roller coaster Kraken in Orlando, Florida to the Madagascar Live! Operation:Vacation show in San Diego, California, this points to why Sea World is so successful. That said, Blackfish by CNN is made for the whole world to show us what is underneath the surface of this company and some of their wrongdoings.

Blackfish makes it's main points through Tilikum the 12,000 pound killer whale who has had 21 offspring and has helped make Sea World successful but has also been responsible for three deaths. Tilikum is a whale that has put his mark on Sea World and now will always define it. Through the use of nets and hooks, Tilkum was wrongfully captured off the cost of Iceland in 1983. I don't think there is anyway a whale or any other type of marine animal for that matter should be taken away from a place where they grew up or where their family is and taken to a Sea World park. It is like taking a human being out of their house and putting them in far away place without any hope of ever getting back.

To learn information about Tilikum, we see interviews with the former trainers of this whale. These are great and informative interviews that show the power, love and intelligence of this whale. They also point to more of Sea World's wrongdoings.

The biggest point Blackfish makes is about the deaths caused by Tililkum that we do see through some scary scenes. One involved a 1991 incident with the trainer Keltie Byrne, another is a strange 1999 incident that involved Daniel Dukes and also an incident in 2010 involving the now well- known trainer, Dawn Brancheau. Afterwards, you cannot look at this large mammal the same but also there are many holes in place in these stories. Where was security in the Daniel Dukes incident where he got in the Tilikum's tank? Dawn Brancheau's story has obviously been covered up many times by Sea World. There is a lot interesting information out there that we really still need to learn.

Also included in this film, are some fun commercials from Sea World. We see a family from Detroit from the 90's doing a promotion, a first time baby whale shown in 1994 and it's fun to look back at this. We also learn about whales' brain which was unexpected. It's the little things like this shows off some Sea World nostalgia and you can see that director Gabriela Cowperthwaite has done her homework.

Blackfish is one-sided but it is a film we need. It is great for what it tells us and it's effect on us. Frankly, nothing in this will want to make you go back to Sea World again. Blackfish is a chilling documentary that can't be always full explained but it is nothing short of amazing. Even though it is a documentary, Blackfish is still no doubt one of the top films of 2013.

Like many I guess, I've seen and considered myself entertained by the sea creatures at Sea World. I was aware of the death of one of the trainers at one of these shows from some years ago but put it down to being an occupational hazard, a tragic but accidental death. This well-made, provocative documentary takes that sad story as its starting point and digs deeper, painting up a tawdry tale of greed, deception and apparent wilful abandonment of care by the named entertainment company, which significantly declined to comment on any of the major accusations lodged here.

From the horrible death of the female trainer in 2010, caught on video, but mercifully cut before she is actually killed, the production traces back the story of the only too well named killer whale and its history of previous attacks on other trainers, caused, allegedly by years of mistreatment of the animal. Sea World's part in a similar European tragedy involving the death of a Spanish trainer only adds to the charge sheet.

A host of former trainers now recanting their previously parroted company-speak of how well the animals are treated is a particularly effective device, but there's much good detective work besides. Most of all, the film isn't afraid to point the finger at the multimillion dollar corporation Sea World and while I hesitate to come to a judgement without the accused exercising the right of reply, it's hard not to conclude that this was an accident, if that's the correct word, waiting to happen.

The film is happy to confine its aim to Sea World alone, but I'm sure I'm not alone in reconsidering my position on the capture and training of animals for our entertainment not only in water parks, but also of course in circuses and zoos.

A sad, sobering, look into an unacceptable mode of entertainment which has surely had its day.

While for the public its easy to pick a side, free the animals or keep them captive to show us what they are what they do and so on... As a person who loves animals and has a knowledge base of behavior captivity as well as a dip and degree in Animal care and management I can honestly say its hard claiming whats right or wrong for many of our animals however marine animals should not be captive. I agree to some extent about zoo breeding to make sure genes are crossed and animals kept from going extinct. Orca's however are doing well in the wild, the only thing killing them is our stupidity. The only thing taking them from their homes is out need for entertainment. They are a highly intelligent mammal like dolphins and need to be left alone. It's easy for people to claim they don't see anything wrong but if you have watched this you know whats wrong. These giants live for 100years in the wild or max 30 in captivity.... how can anyone state they are in better care in captivity! 1percent of wild have collapsed dorsal fins while 100% of captive males have it? this is our fault, worse off we continue to breed from animals who have been used and abused and tormented! They even start to fight and kill each other which is sad as they create family pods in the wild but in captivity they are forced into groupings. This film is amazing, it shows how little knowledge the trainers have how they did in fact love the animals and once they understood they where not helping but hindering the animals they do love so much they stepped back. A must see by anyone thinking of ever going to a show that contains an orca (in fact a must see for anyone who think animals are our entertainment).
