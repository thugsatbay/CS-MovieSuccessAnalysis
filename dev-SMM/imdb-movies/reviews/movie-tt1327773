### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I'll start by stating that I'm a 62 year old white male. I did not grow up in the South - but I did live for a year in Louisiana in the early 70's. I lived through every news event that was portrayed in the movie - that is, I saw and read about them in the actual news when these things happened. Many posters on the boards say that the movie is inaccurate. Then they go on to say things like: His name was changed, he didn't have 2 sons, he didn't look anything like Forest Whitaker, Nixon was miscast, etc. True, the details of The Butler's family life have been dramatized. That is called movie making. The movie was historically accurate in every important way. I don't say that every single detail was true, nor am I saying the portrayal of these historical events was 100% exactly as portrayed. But it is far more accurate (and important) than your average popcorn POS that pervades the theaters these days. I want to state that I have rarely, if ever, been as emotionally affected by any movie. It is brilliant, provocative, artistic, and has a social purpose. Like it or not, persons of African descent have been victimized, downtrodden, brutalized, persecuted, tortured, lynched, raped, and murdered - and only because of their skin color. HOORAY to Lee Daniels for making this movie! Hooray to Forest for being a sensitive, intelligent, highly gifted actor. Hooray to Oprah, whose performance is beyond stellar. Hooray to anyone involved with this movie. Not to say that ALL movies have to take you to the places that this movie does. I guess there is a place for Pacific Rim and Wolverine. So if you think that movies have no business delving into our racist and brutal history, then see one of those movies. But to say that this movie is irrelevant or inaccurate - well, as I said I lived through it all. It is not. What it is, is an exceptional, mature movie for those that want a little more than monsters (the fictional kind). My wife and I went through a whole packet of tissues - we were blubbering like fools. BRAVO!!!!! 9 (rather than 10) stars only because the 10 star reviews are often discounted as over- the-top hero worship. But if Ironman, The Avengers, etc are 10 stars (and I liked those), this movie rates 100 stars - because it is 10X better, more important, more relevant, and more thought provoking.

The actors in this movie were fantastic, however the "rewriting of history" was terrible.

The Butler's real name is Eugene Allen. Here is where the movie rewrote history: he did NOT have a son who died in Vietnam, he did NOT have a son who became a Black Panther, his mother was NO raped by a white cotton field manager, and his father was NOT murdered by the same white man.

So if you take this "made up" stories out of this movie, you have a much different movie. What a disservice to Eugene Allen. You would think that this story could have been a true story, at the very least the opening header should make a statement that this is a FICTIONAL movie.

There's a scene about halfway through Lee Daniel's "The Butler" that is perfect. 

African-American White House butler Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) asks his boss, Mr. Warner, for equal pay for African American staff. They are paid less than white staff, he complains. The audience has been watching Cecil Gaines for a while now, and we know he is an admirable man. He certainly deserves equal pay. 

Warner tells Gaines that if he is not happy with his salary, he can go work someplace else. 

Gaines is trapped in an invisible prison of white supremacy, and he knows it. Whitaker's face shows all the agony of that moment. He quietly leaves Warner's office. 

Forest Whitaker is utterly brilliant in this scene, as he is in the rest of this choppy, heavy-handed, misguided film. 

That scene is worth the entire rest of the film "The Butler." That scene has everything the rest of the film lacks: subtlety, intelligence, and faith in its audience. 

Otherwise, "The Butler" is Civil Rights for Dummies plus an overload of stunt casting. 

"The Butler" tells the story of Cecil Gaines, an African American White House butler. The movie tells us it wants us to pay attention to this humble, working class man. The movie depicts none other than Martin Luther King Jr, right before his assassination, delivering a speech on the importance of domestic workers. 

But the movie belies its own message. "The Butler" doesn't have faith in its audience. It believes that we won't pay attention to this humble, admirable butler. So the film dumps one big Hollywood star and tabloid celebrity after another in small roles, and the film beats us over the head with a dumbed-down, sensationalized, hate-whitey version of Civil Rights. 

Stunt casting: Mariah Carey is on screen for about two minutes as Cecil's mother, and Vanessa Redgrave is on screen for about three minutes as his first employer. The casting of the presidents Cecil worked for is flagrantly weird. It's as if the movie wants to set the audience abuzz over why this or that actor was chosen. John Cusak as Richard Nixon? Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan?? Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower??? Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan???? Did the people who cast this film take any of it seriously? James Marsden, though, is fine as JFK. 

Oprah Winfrey plays Cecil's wife, Gloria. Oprah gives a fine performance. The problem is, she is Oprah Winfrey, and her presence as a celebrity never left my mind as I was watching her. Rather than being moved by the plot, my mind wandered. I thought about her recent public scandals, the Swiss purse incident, and calling Trayvon Martin a modern Emmet Till. I thought about her boyfriend Steadman. I wondered why he has never married Oprah. Again, Oprah's performance was spot on, but the script was not compelling enough to allow me willing suspension of disbelief. 

The film's dumbed down version of Civil Rights is aesthetically and historically criminal. In the first five minutes of the movie, the film depicts two African Americans lynched together beside an American flag. They remain on screen for quite a while. The film returns to the image. A black woman is raped by a white man. Again, weird casting: Alex Pettyfer, one of the most handsome men in the world, is the rapist. Why? Then a black man is killed. The n word is tossed around liberally. Crosses are scary  the Klan burns one and attacks a freedom rider bus. The film eventually states, in so many words, that America was a "concentration camp" for African Americans for hundreds of years, worse than what the Nazis did to the Jews. 

All the whites on screen are rich and powerful. All the blacks, including the Black Panthers, are good, innocent, humble, hard-working, harmless. The Civil Rights movement is all but exclusively black. 

This just isn't true. Comparing the Holocaust to slavery and Jim Crow isn't accurate. The Black Panthers did some very bad things, including to their own members. Thousands were lynched, not millions, thousands of those lynched were white. The largest mass lynching in America was of Italian immigrants; Leo Frank was lynched for being a Jew. 

African Americans made up roughly ten percent of the population; had whites not been part of the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans could never have achieved what they did. The film insists that the Civil Rights Movement was inspired by a "brown man," Gandhi. But in fact Gandhi was inspired by Tolstoy, Thoreau, Christ, and the Bhagavad Gita. The film alludes briefly to Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but does not name them. The film refers to these Jewish Civil Rights martyrs only to cynically dismiss their sacrifice. Americans only care about dead whites, the film says. If that were true, the Civil Rights Struggle would not have achieved what it did. Jim Zwerg, a white man, endured a horrible beating on one freedom ride because he, like many Civil Rights heroes, was inspired by the Judeo-Christian tradition. 

I've lived in the Indian Subcontinent, where the religiously mandated caste system, for millennia, has doomed Untouchables to lives in Hell. I lived in Africa, where the slave trade still flourishes. From a world perspective, the United States is not remarkable because it had slavery and Jim Crow. From a world perspective, the United States is remarkable because it produced the Abolitionists, John Brown, martyrs like Goodman and Schwerner and Viola Liuzzo and heroes like Jim Zwerg and Rabbi Heschel. "The Butler" presents an unbelievable conundrum  a country populated exclusively by evil, rich white supremacists somehow magically changed in 2008 and elected an African American president and presto changeo everything was better for black people.

I was hoping to see a movie about the butler and his experiences in The White House. I'm sure he had a lot of interesting stories to tell and a lot of very interesting experiences in his many years in The White House. Yes, the movie was about a butler to some degree, but it was more about the civil rights movement and the evil white man. I would love to know more about the butler. I would love to have seen his experiences with the presidents the movie skipped over. I think in real life he must have been more interesting than he was portrayed. I also did not like the liberties the movie took with the real butler's life. He spoke of no horrible event on the cotton fields as a child. He had one son, not two. His son, who is still alive, was not a militant. His wife did not have a drinking problem, nor did she have an affair. Why add unnecessary drama? This movie will win awards because of its self righteousness, but not because it's that deserving.

It's always about race with anything Oprah touches and this grossly over-hyped movie is just another example.

One need only see the trailers, watch the clips on the entertainment shows or read user (not critics') reviews to get a hint of what you're in for if you choose to waste your money in a theater watching this tripe.

The film is very loosely based on a real life butler - Eugene Allen (1919-2010))- who had worked in the White House for 34 years from Truman in 1952 to Reagan in 1986.

If you want to know the real story of the real butler, read Wil Haygood's book OR do some research on the internet instead of lining Orca's over-sized pockets by subsidizing yet another fictionalized rewrite of history. 

Here are 3 short examples:

ONE - In the movie, Oprah (as the butler's wife) brags that the White House called her husband to come work there. NOT SO. In reality, the real life butler got his entry level job by hearing that they were looking to routinely hire pantry workers at the White House. 

TWO - In the film version, the butler's son serves in Vietnam and gets killed there. NEVER HAPPENED. Although the real life butler's son did serve in Vietnam, he is alive and well today. No matter to the makers of this film.

THREE - The real life butler never had a second son at all, let alone one who was a Black Panther as depicted in the film. 

Like the liberal media, an agenda is in play here and this racially pandering movie is just another 2 hours of the oprahization of America - the essence of which is: black man good, whitey bad.

Waste of time, waste of money. Read the book if you care at all.

From the opening scene of this film I was viscerally affected.

Let's just get this out of the way: Forrest Whitaker gives a magnificent performance in this film. Whitaker can dial it back (as he does in this film) or dial it UP as he did in "The Last King of Scotland" and play either with equal aplomb.

In terms of regard per performance, he's actually criminally underrated.

I thought Oprah's performance was very good, but I also enjoyed Cuba Gooding, Jr's return to a substantive role. It is nice to see him doing something poignant and relevant again.

The pace of the film is good and keeps you interested despite the flick's non-trivial running time.

It's not always an easy watch, but it wasn't meant to be.

This film is NOT meant to be a point-for-point reenactment of "the real" butler's life, but a weaving together of vignettes and actual historic occurrences. (It is BASED ON a true story, but not a biopic.) In this vain, the movie succeeds flawlessly.

There are clever casting choices (Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan REALLY IS a hoot for anyone who knows their history) and while admittedly some of the actors playing presidents lack the visages of their famous characters, the acting itself defeats these deficiencies. (I found Liev Schriber's LBJ hysterical AND accurate.) 

From the opening scenes of brutal rape, murder and disregard for human life, to the struggle to maintain a semblance of decency and the fight for basic quality of life, this film depicts the struggle of MANY black people of the time - told through the prism of this butler.

I know this to be true because there are similar tales of these occurrences in my OWN family. I don't have to look far.

This film won't play well with the "get over it" set - or anyone who has ever used the term "race baiter." These folks are already approaching this flick with a certain agenda - and they aren't ready for it's truisms. Unfortunately, there are enough of them to result in the ridiculously low rating this film has so far undeservedly garnered on IMDb. Even the most ardent detractor who GENUINELY disliked this film without political agenda would have to admit that this film isn't a 1 star offering.

A rating that low is downright silly.

That said, for those of us who actually live in the real world and understand historical context, you will probably enjoy this film immensely. Like others, I experienced applause at the end of the film's showing, and I'd call the crowd mix about 50/50 black-to-white at my suburban theater. This would indicate to me, at least anecdotally that the entire crowd appreciated the film.

This film is not meant to be a pure biography per se... in fact, I'd say it's more about a FAMILY than even the butler or his job in general, but we pay attention because this particular butler happened to serve in the White House.

This film is REALLY about the generational struggles that occur in EVERY family, but made even more powerful by the juxtaposition and immediacy of the civil rights movement. This makes it STILL relevant, as its problems still echo in the headlines today.

If you wind up drawing parallels between Emmett Till, Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin after watching this film - then you probably got the intent- and most likely enjoyed it. If you are of the mind that racism isn't that bad, the 50s in the south were "the good ol' days" and even the holocaust was probably overblown, then this flick isn't for you.

Might I suggest "Gone with the Wind?"

Go see this movie..It shook me to my core..As a white person I've never been more ashamed in my life..And saddened.. We are in the midst of racial struggle for equal rights right now..I sat in a packed theater with all white old people and you could've heard a pin drop.. It felt like a Forest Gump movie but with the racial history of our country as the topic.. and it was NOT a pretty picture. Thank you for doing this movie Lee, it is something we all need to see as Americans and we all have to face that we still have MAJOR racial bigotry. It must NOT be tolerated! I am white, 63 yrs old, born in Miami Fl and living in LA. Please go see this and then go about being an agent of change..we need to move on to better things and stamp out racism in America..it has NO place here..and we should all be ashamed of it's existence and allowing it to persist.. The cameos were priceless and OPRAH, (tho I am not a fan) was incredible!

You'll feel emotions throughout "Lee Daniel's The Butler," but you'd also cry if someone kicks a kitten on TV. Dropping in simplistic scenes of hardship and meager triumph does not a good film make. This is not a good film.

Technically, it's fine. And it's got a lot of stars. Some are hard to spot such as Vanessa Redgrave as a racist Southerner and Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan. But, it's overlong even though the story spans nearly nine decades. In all those years, very little actually seems to happen.

Nothing really happens with our hero, Forest Whitaker as White House butler Cecil Gaines. He does his job quietly. He has very little impact on those around him either at home or in the House. The film is named for this person. It would be nice if he was interesting.

The only real action comes from Cecil's son Earl Gaines (David Banner). Earl takes up the fight for civil rights. But, even he's mostly along for the ride, so while he's not substantial enough for his own movie, without him in this one, I probably would have fallen asleep.

And that's the thing. For all the dramatic tension offered by the subjects of fighting for civil rights in the South and working in the White House, this film is surprisingly boring. Sure, I got to see lots of cameos by famous actors as Presidents of the United States, yet even Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower did little to elevate my interest.

Like Forest Gump, the events of history pass by around Forest Whitaker's butler. He is alongside every president from Ike to Reagan. Unlike "Forest Gump," it's never that entertaining.

"Forest Gump" and "Lee Daniel's The Butler" also share a feeling that they take themselves to be significant films saying important things, but I am hard-pressed to say just what those things are. Putting powerful, historical events on screen is not the same as saying something insightful about them.

I am an avid movie watcher. I enjoy most movies. However, when a movie portrays itself as a historical account about a figure that is easily verified, then at least it should be accurate. I understand artistic license and also understand that actors/actresses and directors have personal motives in what they do and how it is done. This is so far off historical fact that it is almost a comedy. I am sure that there was a way to keep it historically accurate, and still forward the agenda of those involved. Outright fiction was not needed. Those that refuse to educate themselves and believe hype and fairy tales deserve the school of hard knocks that life will hand them when they attempt to use the hype and fairy tales as facts.

It would be important to note: Not all Blacks were slaves. Not all slaves were Black. Not all slave owners were White. Not all atrocities to slaves were at the hand of whites. While slavery is detestable in modern constructs, historically for thousands of years it has been practiced. That does not justify slavery, it is however a fact. Sadly, this movie will win many accolades, not because of the accuracy, acting, story / plot, or other factors, but only because of hype and political correctness. I am sorry if I have offended people. But, I have expressed my opine, you are welcome to disagree. To me the movie was a waste of time, and money. Not just mine, but all those that are suckered into seeing it.

I'll nail my colors to the mast straight away. This film is truly awful. From beginning to end. I think the only social problems its director fails to try to address are parking fines and a cure for warts. All others it struggles to squeeze into an over packed (and overly long) cartoon version of American history from the late 1950's forward. I even found myself wondering after only about 5 minutes of viewing how actors of the caliber contained herein would...COULD...even think about associating their widely respected names with such drivel. They did and that is the biggest puzzle of all...or rather, the second biggest puzzle.

Because this film did not need to be made. It's as simple as that. And it puzzles me why it was. In a haphazard, back-handed way it shows us nothing that we already did not know. Except, if anything, for reasons that totally escaped me, that the director wanted to willfully and openly distort both American history and what we know. I sat in the cinema thinking, 'What is the purpose of all of this? A 3 minute Youtube video under the guidance of a 1st year university undergraduate of American History would have been much more worthwhile and enlightening. 

In addition, all characters in this film are barely fleshed out in any kind of detail. Forrest Whitaker's face moves twice in 2 and half hours and Oprah...Oprah...why? Just...WHY? I can't be bothered to research anything about the development of this terrible fim but, was it her cash mountain that funded this drivel? If so, please note Oprah...for future projects please employ a writer with something above a third grade level of world events because The dialogue seems to have been written by a 7 year old and it's slow...man oh man, it's slow. 

I will say one thing in its defense, however. There is a real man called Cecil Gaines and he worked in the White House as a butler. These are the only historically accurate matters this film presents. 

It's your $10 you'll hand over at the box office...spend it how you want. Personally, I was sorely tempted to ask for mine back.

Although the movie is based on a true story, a story that is very interesting, the producers couldn't leave it alone. Instead, they tampered with it so much that they made such an interesting story, uninteresting.

The only bright spot in the movie is Forest Whitaker. Given what he had to work with, he did a superb job of playing Eugene Allen. Allen was a humble man and Whitaker captures that humility. Originally, Denzel Washington was selected to play the part but it is unlikely that Washington, as good an actor as he is, could portray a humble man.

One of he big weaknesses in the film was the supporting cast. Oprah Winfrey was miscast as the butlers wife. That really distracted from Goines. Oprah came across as much too strong a personality as if the film was centered around her instead of Goines and her acting was mediocre. In real life, the story was about Allen, and not about his wife, but Oprah made the film as much about her as Allen. There are two explanations for writing the story to include Oprah. Either, the producers wanted her star power, or more likely, they needed her money to produce the film and had to cast her in the movie to get it.

Other than the strong performance by Whitaker, about the redeeming thing about the movie is that at least viewers are aware of the basic theme of the story, as fictionalized as it is, is that there was a butler of color that served eight presidents, was invited by one president to an official dinner, and got to see a man of color elected president. But we all could have learned that if it had been made a TV documentary rather than a crappy movie.

This movie is an otherwise interesting story about a conservative black butler that worked in the White House who had a son in the civil rights movement of the 60's and 70's. It was more about the latter than the former, except for the consternation the son gave the father who was of an earlier time and mind set. So much for the story. Now for the propaganda...[1] The producers obviously don't like White people (all portrayed as evil, self-centered bigots (a lie); [2] don't like Texans, portraying Lyndon Johnson only as a brash jerk, showing him ranting bigoted epithets while sitting on a toilet doing his business (unnecessary and meant to demean, never mind that he did more about civil rights than most); [3] cast Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan, even though they are politically polar opposites (meant to insult Republicans and Conservatives). I noted that Fonda had an obvious smirk on her face the full time she was on camera. [4] Portrayed Ronald Reagan as a bigoted, big nosed fool (also a lie); [5] We can all agree that Richard Nixon did some bad things, but the movie's very short portrayal of him is as a fool and a whimpering drunk (meant to demean and degrade); [6] Spent 5 minutes praising Obama as the Savior of the World (an obvious political advertisement); [7] Portrayed the Democrats, except for LBJ, as wonderful, inspired bearers of all good will for the oppressed of the world. (Never mind that Lincoln was a Republican). And finally [8] displayed anyone that the producers don't like in "caricature" casting (exaggerated features, odd faces, generally ugly). The more I think about this movie, the more offended I get. I can only conclude that it was targeted to reinforce biased stereotypes for the liberal community so that they would get out the Democratic vote in the upcoming midterm elections. The acting?? While there was some good done, it was for the most part very flat or very cheesy, with the possible exception of Oprah Winfrey. Let me be clear...there were no Academy Award performances here. The story could have been done well if it was done as an accurate portrayal of historical that focused more on the butler instead of being a propaganda mill. What a shame.

For anyone who has seen The Help this is the less elegant version.. Actually this isn't elegant at all, it's just bland and poorly done. Nothing really happens, and even though the tagline is "One quiet voice can ignite a revolution" very little actually happens in the film.. 

First off Whitaker is thoroughly underwhelming, which is honestly surprising. I often enjoy his films, but he is totally uninspiring in this. 

Oprah has gotten a lot of buzz due to her role, many even talking about Oscar noms. Is it that good? No... I must admit I was a little biased coming into this due to her publicity stunt with regards to the whole "Swiss purse" incident. 

Jane Fonda, a die-hard liberal in the role of Nancy Reagan would be akin to casting Jon Voight as FDR. In other words, it doesn't make any sense and instead jumps out as an eye sore. 

My biggest problem with this film is the lack of any grace. It's just a race guilt tripping wet dream.... The Help was funny, it was touching and the actresses did phenomenal. While watching The Butler I couldn't get past "oh that's Oprah, there's Jane Fonda.."

To close, don't see this. It's boring, it's not entertaining, it doesn't have any memorable performances, many needless guest stars, and of course Oprah. You are much better off renting The Help for a truly enjoyable film where you don't finish the movie feeling uncomfortable for being white.

"Lee Daniels': The Butler" is historical fiction. It's fitting Lee Daniels put his name in the title of the film as this is Daniels' version of "The Butler" and not Eugene Allen's. 

The premise of the film is an American History Tale stretching from the era before the civil rights movement to current day as experienced by a black family whom's patriarch is a butler in the White House. The story is a sensationalism depiction of the plight of Blacks through their journey to racial equality. Unfortunately its not factually accurate. 

Below is an accounting of the films "Facts versus Fiction" 

FACTS: 1. There was a black butler that worked at the White House for 34 years. (His name was Eugene Allen) 2. Eugene was married. 3. Eugene and his Helene wife had a family. 4. Helene died just before the 2008 Election 5. Daniels based the main character in his film Cecil Gaines on the life of Eugene Allen.

Fiction makes up EVERYTHING else

FICTION - HIGH LEVEL: 1. Eugene's early life: FICTIONAL 2. Eugene's family: FICTIONAL 3. How Eugene was hired to work at the White House: FICTIONAL 4. Eugene's momentous first day at the White House: FICTIONAL

FICTION - GRANULAR: 1. Cecil and Gloria are made up. (Daniels' characters Cecil and Gloria Gaines were based LOOSELY on Eugene and Helene Allen) 2. Eugene's mother was NOT raped by a white man (and in front of Eugene and his father) 3. Eugene's father was NOT killed by a white man while working in a cotton field. Eugene's father was not killed in front of Eugene. And NOT by a white man that had just raped Eugene's mother. 4. Eugene applied for "a job" at the White House and was not sought out. 5. Eugene began as a pantry worker at the White House in 1952, and was not promoted to butler until YEARS later. 6. Biggest liberty taken in the film was giving Cecil two sons. Eugene and Helene only had one son. Louis, the alleged older son WAS INVENTED in the film for DRAMATIC EFFECT. 7. Eugene's son Charles was NOT killed in Vietnam. (Charles did serve but is alive today) 8. Eugene's son Charles was NOT a Black Panther, NOT a Freedom Rider, NOT a Civil Rights Activist, was NOT on a Bus attacked by the KKK, was NOT a part of a sit-in at a white's only lunch counter, was NOT ever arrest for protesting for Civil Rights, was NOT ever abused by police fighting for Civil Rights. 9. Eugene and Charles did NOT have a strained relationship and were NEVER estranged. 10. Eugene and Helene had a healthy marriage contrary to what is portrayed in the film. 11. Eugene's service to the first family at the White House did NOT result in his always absent from the home, neglecting his family, or negatively impacting his home life. 12. Helene was NEVER resentful/ jealous of Eugene's work at the White House, was NOT an alcoholic, did NOT have an affair, and never slapped Charles' girlfriend.

ALL THESE DEFINING DETAILS WERE INVENTED FOR THE FILM. By literary definitions, 'historical fiction' is where a writer who is aware of the historical details, opts to take some creative liberties for the sake of story's plot/atmosphere/sensationalism. Oprah and Daniels film was 'historical fiction' masquerading as the history 'based on the life of Eugene Allen'. For political motives Eugene's story was manipulated till Daniels made it resemble a tale of the civil rights movement. 

Some level of embellishment and Hollywood dramatization is expected Oprah and Daniels substituted a Eugene's tale with a work of total fiction. As can be surmised by many of the reviews on IMDb, knowledge the film was a farce is not well understood. This is of no surprise considering the PR machine and media hype surrounding the film. The crime here was squandering the opportunity to tell Eugene Allen's ACTUAL story. A 34-year observer in the White House was interesting in its own right; albeit not as socially inflammatory as the version concocted by Oprah and Daniels. 

The film makers attempted to wrap every injustice any black person ever went through into one alleged family's story. (I won't even touch on the film makers attempt to portray EVERY white president that appeared in the film as just another racist.) Oprah's new found role and agenda as a Race Antagonist is in front and center in the film. Film ends with excellent example of Brown Racism. Black voters are depicting as falling all over themselves to vote for Obama the Black candidate not because of his politics, stance, or any other reason than his skin color. The movie paints a clear picture that Obama was supported by minorities and the media chiefly because electing a Black Man as President was seen as the next evolutionary step in the Civil Rights movement. Unintentionally the ugly truth about the engine that drove the Obama train slips out. Non-white voters didn't care about the politics just that Obama wasn't white (well, was more black than white). Even far-fetched implication that a White person today is anything but color blind is completely unacceptable yet minorities exhibiting Brown Racism is encouraged and framed as 'ethnic pride'. The only demographic in this country becoming color blind are Caucasians. Look at the 2008 and 2012 Presidential election exit polls. The statistics tell the truth. White voters voted on issues. All other demographics (non-whites) vote based on candidate skin color (for the guy who was NOT white). 

This film is for the pro-white guilt crowd that likes inflammatory sensationalized depictions of Black angst. Those tired of the all whites being deemed racists and all black being painted as victims; you won't like the undertone or the films symbolism. I'd have preferred not supporting the film after seeing what an anti-white racist skew it put on things.

I'd first like to say that Forest Whitaker is a brilliant actor. Had it not been for his artful presence and emotion, this would have been a flop. He deserves 10 stars; the film does not. I'd like to say first that this is not a biopic. There is no Cecil Gaines that worked at the White House. None. This story is loosely (very loosely) based on Eugene Allen who worked at the White House for 34 years. He was from Virginia, never worked in a field, never saw his mother violated nor his father murdered, and did not have a son killed in Vietnam. The film really painted this to be the truth and led patrons to believe it was.

Some of the most patently preposterous casting ever was seen in this film. James Marsden is the only one who even came remotely close. Robin Williams is a horrible Ike Eisenhower. He looks more like Harry Truman on Chemo. John Cusack is a ghastly Richard Nixon. The gross miscasting was very distracting and the cast members exhibited little chemistry. It was if I were watching a poorly edited TV drama in many places.

The civil rights story is fine but we've seen it a hundred times and this parroted many of the good movies already made about this movement. So much of it was clichéd. I would have rather seen a movie about Mr. Allen's interaction with the chief executives than a fictional story about blacks and whites, alcohol abuse, and Jim Crow.

The tag-line for this film reads, "one quiet voice can ignite a revolution". 

Now. Here is the question I asked myself half way through this movie, and still ask now:

What revolution did this butler ignite?

In fact, the ONLY person who at least tried to ignite any sort of "revolution" was the butler's son. But, as with any typical Hollywood film that wants to flirt with the topics of civil rights and racism in a movie, The Butler takes advantage of any chance it gets to ridicule, downplay or straight-up laugh at the mere notion of black people standing up for themselves.

Shame on Lee Daniels, Oprah Winfrey & Forest Whitaker in particular for trying to pass this garbage off as a constructive work truly addressing civil rights and the plight & struggle of black people in America. It is nothing more than a Lifetime movie trying to puff up its chest - with the aforementioned agents as the main culprits on & off the screen - as being more important than it really is. 

The editing was quite abrupt in key scenes where you're expecting something truly powerful. Scenes get started where it seems like the film is finally going to sink its teeth in the subject matter it is supposed to be addressing...... then its "Cut" and on to the next scene. Things happen in the film with absolutely no basis as to why they're happening. The whole thing is a mess....its nothing but mere bullet points in the life of a man who we're told is a hero but shows NOTHING as to why he should even have such a distinction. The main character, if I'm to take this film's word for it, was content with just keeping his head down and his mouth shut throughout his life; while at the same time practically disowning his oldest son who chose to take a different path. He served a lot of presidents in the white house as a butler. THIS is who I should look at and commend as a hero of civil rights? What a JOKE.

The Butler is a total farce of a film with no teeth to it whatsoever. The fact that well-to-do blacks went out in full force cosigning this movie like it was the greatest, most important black film ever is wrong on so many levels. I, for one, was not duped by the bogus media campaign because, that's Hollywood. Throw a few 'Mantans' in there and get 'em to dance!

I'm just glad i approached this film the way I did...with extremely low expectations. This movie was easily worst than that. It's nothing but a Lifetime or TV movie of the week garbage that continues the Hollywood tradition: Maintain the image of blacks as being inferior and subservient to whites. 

The Butler = An ABSOLUTE INSULT!

The Butler looks at the civil-rights movement from the point of view of ordinary African-American people. The genius of this film is the choice of a white house servant and his life as a focal point to the historical events portrayed.

The drama is both absorbing and emotionally rich. What is surprising is the way that sympathy for Whitaker's central character, Cecil Gaines, is so strong that the events, though sprawling, always resonate as intricate pieces of his life; because of this anchor, the film remains intimate and personal, even when the fate of an entire nation is involved.

Each actor excels here, the reason for this is that they, while obviously being highly talented individuals, are led by a commanding director who knows exactly what he's saying at all times, while keeping all the complexity of his subject matter.

You could say this is an African-American Forrest Gump: the story of an everyman whose fate collides repeatedly with historical figures and events, but The Butler is far more mature and subtle work which, beyond race, questions our roles as men and women in our daily lives. It questions and explores moral responsibility and how from generation to generation we can all search for what is the right moral conduct in the face of opposition, oppression and evil. It also shows how we can make a profound difference in life through dedication, integrity and love.

The movie was untrue, and portrays whites in this movie to be monsters of events that never happened to the real Butler. Strictly as a professional, though, the movie was excellent with excellent acting; however, the "commercial" at the end of credits was THE MOST RACIST PILE OF CRAP that I have ever seen. First, asking blacks to vote is one thing, and the director of that affair assumes that mostly blacks will see it, so of course it is OK to ask them to get out there and vote, especially for the failing city of Detroit. But in 2013, calling whites "the Man" and referring to us as "He" and not an entire race; and how we have taken everything from the blacks of Detroit or anywhere else for that matter, is racist! We (Americans) are all out there trying to make it right now, in this ruined economy, but when it's all said and done, we are making our own future; all of us. Blacks are allowed to vote, women are allowed to vote. There should be no scapegoats anymore. There is also hateful remarks about "the Arabs" taking gas stations and other establishments (etc.) from the blacks as well, and implying the dummy is mad that they are able to "come up." I can not BELIEVE that a movie of this caliber could sit there with a message that good, and then slap that sad excuse for a pile of crap on the end of it. It made me so sick, I had to watch it to the very end, to see if it was a joke. I was again, disappointed. I am very sorry for what my white history has done to your black history. I am very sorry that people have died, and been abused, and are still being abused today, but to sit there and advocate for the plight of the black man, and then ruin it with that creepy, racist message, was appalling to say the least! I think that something should be done about this. I believe that the stupid dummy bit should be removed immediately, followed by someone losing their dang job. Come on...really? (Anger words removed for PG submission to enlarge the audience - stronger language should be substituted!)

******** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS ********* 

There are, undoubtedly, scenes in Lee Daniel's The Butler that made me feel quite uncomfortable. Most certainly, many other viewers will echo similar discomfort experienced while watching this near great movie. Unfortunately, the existence of atrocities and flagrant injustices in our not too distant past doesn't mean that they should be whitewashed or airbrushed out of our collective memories! (Absolutely no pun intended here) 

Don't let me give you the wrong impression about The BUTLER. In just over 2 hours until end credits, there are but a scant few minutes of images that some of us would, perhaps, just as soon forget. At the heart of this remarkable film, is a tale of a great generational divide between estranged father and first-born son; redemption, change, forgiveness, repentance and catharsis are also pivotal elements in this "Inspired by a True Story" drama painted on a historical backdrop canvass.

Although The BUTLER does highlight the tremendous progress our society has made in the past century toward fulfillment of Dr. Martin Luther King's "Dream", obviously, there is an undercurrent underscoring the fact that this area is one that involves constant self-reinvention to ensure continued improvement.

There are multiple noteworthy elements here. First, Oprah Winfrey's triumphant return to an on-screen leading role. Despite having done numerous voice-overs in recent years, BUTLER represents the end of a 15 year hiatus, when she participated in the ill-fated BELOVED. Her performance, although not quite Oscar nomination caliber, would win, without a doubt, an Academy Award for best "Billionaire Female Actor on the Planet", if such a prize existed! Accepting this role surely resulted in reduced income for Oprah in 2013. If that doesn't make her participation in this project a "Labor of Love", what would? 

BUTLER is my pick for 2013 Best Ensemble Performance Golden Globe. Cast Credits give the impression of a page lifted directly from a Who's Who in Acting & Entertainment! Cuba Gooding, Jr.; Robin Williams, in a refreshing, but brief, appearance as a pensive and soft-spoken President Eisenhower; Vanessa Redgrave; Clarence Williams III; James Marsden as President Kennedy; John Cusack, as an ever brooding and duplicitous President Nixon; David Oyelowo, as the rebellious prodigal son; Terence Howard; Lenny Kravitz; Mariah Carey; Jane Fonda, who sparkled as Nancy Reagan and Alan Rickman as her careful-not-to-step-on-her-toes husband, Ronald! The only weak link, in my opinion, was Liev Schreiber as President Lyndon B. Johnson. His portrayal just did not resonate with me.

Quite frankly, despite analyzing carefully for any historical missteps, there were only a couple rather minor ones that were noticeable. About three-quarters into BUTLER, the story-line, focus and viewer interest level seemed to sputter a bit, but got right back on track rather quickly.

The film did attempt to provide moments of comic relief from the oftentimes somber on-screen events, most of them evoking healthy laughter but a handful of them kind of fell flat. If it weren't for these few mentioned flaws, BUTLER most definitely would have been rewarded with a 10*Star* rating! When released on DVD, rest assured it will be added to my 800+ collection! 

.ENJOY/DISFUTELA!!

I looked forward to watching the Butler. I was anticipating that this "inside" source within the White House would be able to reveal to us some kernel of history previously unknown to me. I was sadly disappointed.

My first clue should have been the fact that it was titled Lee Daniels' the Butler. Silly me had thought that the butler's name was Lee Daniels and that layers of proofreading had failed to notice the extra apostrophe in Daniels and the missing comma before the Butler. I was stunned that the director felt so self-important as to interject himself into the title. I had thought that that practice disappeared with the death of Otto Preminger or Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show. Silly me. It should have alerted me to the self aggrandizing film that was to follow.

My next clue should have been the on-screen statement that this was "inspired" by actual events; not "the following is a true story," or even "based on actual events." So, what I should have expected was a fiction hidden within historical events. A black man's Forest Gump, if you will.

There is much angst floating about the ethers of the Internet about how this movie was robbed: neither Lee Daniels nor Oprah Winfrey were accorded an Academy Award nomination. Neither deserved one. Let me explain why.

In the first place we followed the life of Cecil Gaines through thirty some years of his time in the White House, through the presidencies Eisenhower  Bush. During each administration some historic event was highlighted and served as the opportunity for Lee Daniels to tell us how badly black people have been treated in this country. Well, we get that. Black Americans have been treated horrendously in this country and in many places, still are. I don't need a movie telling me that every ten minutes. So the screenplay was less story than an indictment of the sins of white people, interjected in frequency and location with all the appropriateness of pairing a fine Bordeaux with an Oscar Meyer wiener.

The acting was an embarrassment: Robin Williams as Eisenhower? Liev Schreiber as Lyndon Johnson? James Marsden as Kennedy? John Cusack as Nixon? Seriously? I have not seen such poor casting in an awfully long time. I was surprised to find a segment wherein Kennedy connecting with Gaines telling him how he now understand the plight of the black man, borderline sobbing to boot. That he had changed Bobby Kennedy's heart, he had changed Jack Kennedy's heart. Really? I've heard of presidents having kitchen cabinets but this was ridiculous. Similarly, the primary black characters were miscast. Forest Whitaker is one of my all-time favorite actors. But to put him in a role where, without substantial makeup, this 52-year-old man must portray a young thirty-something, is criminal. Same could be said for 37 year-0ld David Oyelowo, cast in the part of a college-age son. Oyelowo is a fine actor with an extremely bright future. This role certainly will not be helpful. Then there is 59-year-old Oprah Winfrey, playing the part of an early 30 something woman when it's clear that she is closer to 60.

There are factual inconsistencies which other posters have pointed out such as Nixon lobbying the White House servants for votes in an area, Washington, D.C. which did not vote for president. Or the inclusion of musical numbers that have not yet been created. That Gaines would have been allowed to hold such a position with a son substantially involved in the Black Panther Party is fantasy.

This movie did not deserve my time which I have lost forever nor does it deserve an award of the status of the Golden Globe or an Oscar. Since you cannot get back the time that you spend watching this textbook case of Hollywood narcissism, move onto something else.

I read about Eugene Allen before filming began. I had looked forward to seeing the movie about a man who served so many presidents. When Barack Obama came on screen for an obvious photo op, as if he had anything at all to do with Mr. Allen, I felt betrayed. Why, for crying out loud, does this man have to pop out of anything that might cast him in a favorable light, in front of a (albeit shrinking) friendly audience? If MacDonalds were to undertake a large-scale publicity campaign for an anniversary, I think Barack would show up as Ronald Obama McDonald. I rented this movie from Redbox. I want my $1.31 back. I want my 2 hours back. What a disappointment, I bet Eugene Allen was a great man. He must have been, to have worked so well with such enormous egos. This movie lets him down, it lets his family down, it lets the audience down. Makes sense they made this piece of propaganda after Mr. Allen's death, he isn't around to protest. Oh did I like the movie? I'd say it was fair, although unfair to history. Nixon had his faults, but he was a champion of civil rights. Reagan did not dismantle civil rights legislation. LBJ also pushed for civil rights, but only as half our major cities were in flames and the country faced a real threat of anarchy. LBJ may or may not have personally favored civil rights, but he sure as hell was pragmatic. The political slant if this movie is abhorrent. Horrible, wretched little propaganda piece. In her review of the the Butler, Eliana Dockterman (Time), wrote "it's hard to determine which parts of the story are based on Allen's real life  and which parts are added for dramatic effect." Mr. Allen and his wife had only one son, Charles, who was never associated with the Black Panthers and who never ran for political office. The Georgia cotton field events? All dramatic embellishment. The real Mr. Allen was from Virginia. The terrible events about his parents were fictionalized. Did I say, "wretched"? Everybody associated with this piece of trash should be ashamed.

The story sounded so promising and had such a potential, so I was really surprised by how mediocre this movie was. What it mainly lacks is soul. None of the many historical events felt something. All fell flat. I didn't even care about the "Butler"'s personal story. And the acting was bad. Bad. Even for the standards of Mr. Whitaker. Everyone's acting was worse than a daily soap extra. I blame the Director for this.

The casting of the presidents was also an epic failure. Cusak as Nixon? Only Alan Rickman seemed like a good choice for R.Reagan.

This was a huge disappointment. I want to touch on 2 points here .

First point, Indecisive - This movie is a real Yawn. Here we have another one of those films that is centered on racism...but it kind of ends up rather all over the place. I understand that each character has its own perspective, on whether to actively participate in politics or to be submissive. In fact I think the directors purposely position the movie in that the whole family encompasses different angles of African American struggle. The sad thing is, in the end, such monumental ordeal appeared rather ordinary, simply because the creators didn't locate enough strings to connect all the dots together, and provide that resonance that would have made this movie amazing.

Second point, whether this movie portray the original butler in a justified manner, never mind that it is only 'loosely' based on Eugene Allen's account. Online sources (very easy-to-find wikipedia articles) reveal several critical flaws that ticked me off - i) the wife was not an alcoholic, ii) the son that went to fight in Vietnam returned home in one piece, iii) the other son was invented, iv) he only attained the highest butler rank during Reagan's administration v) The butler's beginnings were all fabricated - this point is the biggest mistake committed in this movie, in my opinion, because we as the audience would want to know how the main character chose the path of a butler in the first place.

When I first heard about this film, I was excited because of the premise of being an eye witness inside the most powerful site in the Western world, a silent observant who was part of a group undergoing a multitude of social and psychological changes. His interaction with the various leaders during the period he worked there couldn't have been more interesting or relevant, and when you heard who was being cast, you waited anxiously for a classic to be created. It was an inspired plan. The reality is that "The Butler" comes across as something very simplistic, with very few shades between two different worlds. It turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, with a few, very small diamonds thrown in there.

Of course, Whitaker does the best he can with his role, but even he takes too long to come to life. Whereas Day Lewis was a volcanic force ready to take charge, and we never doubted his mettle, Whitaker is a solid man, with a great soul whose nature remains hidden by some mysterious layer that just frustrates constantly. The film hardly comes alive in the first half, and this is only during moments inside the White House. There are wonderful cameos by the actors playing the presidents. There is turmoil in the few words they utter because they know they are facing the monsters of discrimination and racism. Kennedy shows some conflict, and Nixon in a couple of intense and mystifying scenes puts in a better perspective because he doesn't negate his nature and understand the role of a politician. Later on, we see The wonderful Rickman and Fonda, painfully underutilized show the face of America. They know what they have at their service and use him to the best of their advantage. This is the moment where the film comes alive, but it might a little too late to call it a classic.

Sadly, the bits of the movie where we would have humanized the family of this interesting human being are as flat as a child's attempt to recreate a classic. Puffing on a cigarette, looking bothered hardly qualifies as you as a troubled addict. Here is a waste of a potentially wonderful character. There are problems with the dialog. It just never rings real. The conversations are forced and feel unrehearsed. It's devastating to see Howard stand around and do very little. It is puzzling how some of the best bits are from those who have the least to say. Kravitz and Carey (who has maybe four silent minutes) says more with their respective, pained expressions. Jane Fonda was striking as the ultimate manipulator who really means the lines, but the puzzling question is exactly what she wants from her quick and effective request.

Things are a bit problematic with the narration, as if it tries to pick up and drive the message. There is very little in the way of a middle ground where the complexities of human nature can be appreciated. People are either simpletons or masterful leaders. We just don't see how people change in a different variety of situations. There is a marvelous scene with young Caroline, asking bluntly and directly, a question from our iconic butler. The adults are not at this level. They act as if they're not willing to think about the matter.

The worst is having the bits of real news footage being way more impactful than the drama on the screen. Yes, the choreography is there in the cafeteria scene, and we should be able to cringe in horror as we expect the Klan to bring havoc, but unlike other films like "41", "The Color Purple", and "Ghosts of Mississippi", we are already numb, or we can't ever feel our emotions because something is blocking it. It is puzzling because this director has given us "Precious", which with all its surrealism hits you in the gut, and there is also the fantastic and under appreciated "The Paperboy" where you can feel the darkness inside every one present.

Maybe the intent was there, but it was an important subject with such a span, and it was as developed as it could have been, but then the question comes in why are there brilliant performances lost in here. I wanted to see more of Redgrave's conflicted matriarch, a fine metaphor for America. In "The Help" Viola's anger simmers below the surface, and we feel her pain. Here it's like a having a catalog or a photo album telling us what to look for, but in cinema, we expect more than just good production values.

Being 60 and having lived through much of this time period, I'm sorry to say that I found the movie to be very simplistic and quite dull. Jackie K with the hat, Johnson on the toilet with the Beagles. 

Of course we all know he had beagles and had no qualms about speaking to his people while on the toilet, but this movie seemed to just be filled with these clichés. There were also too many historical inaccuracies. I could start listing them, but what's the point. Jackie never called her husband John, he was Jack!

I found it very simplistic in it's approach to the racial issues, (which after-all is what the movie was about). These issues were far more complicated. Did the producers and writers believe us not bright enough to tell the stories on a more elevated level?

Unforgivable, no mention of Rosa Parks.

I'm afraid to believe that:

1 Was dumbed down purposely 

2 This movie accurately shows the extreme failing of our educational system. Thus this movie had to be created on such a simple level.

One other complaint is that it in no way accurately showed the extreme fear we (black and white) felt as these national events unfolded.

My answer: Read some books. "Native Sun", "The autobiography of Malcolm X" etc etc. You'll learn a lot more of the times.
