### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.

I did not know what to expect from this movie. It is a stunningly accurate trip into the mind of a BP sufferer. It shows the disease from the outside, too. It is amazing in its accuracy. The mood swings, the detachment from reality, the failure to learn from past errors are there. Here is a guy who has so messed up he is in the hospital. He is released into the custody of his parents. He improves himself physically yet cannot see what he has done, what he is now, and what the future portends with any sort of reality.

There are other situations in the film which mirror the BP life. There are job losses, broken relationships, unlimited optimism, anger, and a feeling that no one understands you. But he doesn't even understand himself. He thinks he is the only sane person around. He is in complete denial yet goes along with treatment just to get along with others.

The obsession with his estranged wife drives him. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her.

Then there is the hair trigger and the propensity toward violence which ultimately put him into the hospital. He has the belief that he sees with much more clarity than anyone else. There is also the hatred of medications and the belief that he doesn't need them.

Yet, there is hope. There is no miraculous cure. There is a negotiated peace between his illness and the way he must be to survive in the world.

The only thing I felt was missing was the crushing depression. But I understand that. Depression makes for lousy movies. The film is strictly about a manic life that wants to be better but cannot accept that he is badly off dead center normal.

If you are bi-polar and under control, see this film! If you live with or deal with a BP, see this movie. If you are untreated, you won't get it because BP clouds the mind.

My new wife and I went to see it. Up front I told her that I had this mental illness. She still married me. She is a health care worker with an understanding of illness and of treatment. After the film she asked me what I thought.

I told her that I was a bit frightened to tell her that the portrayal is spot on and that I had seen all of it before.

But like all bipolar sufferers, I wanted her to know that "I was never that bad." The truth is, I was....but we BP people don't handle reality all that well.

I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from Pat and Tiffany. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the "silver lining" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November.

So, the acting in this film is excellent and that's why the one star. Other than that, this is a hot mess of a movie in terms of any sense of reality, common sense, and human behavior.

It makes is appear that bipolar is pretty much curable if a person meets the right hot girl and takes meds for a short time. And don't worry if the other crazy guy from the mental institution comes to visit as he's not really all that crazy, and the audience never figures out why he's there or what happens to him in the end.

Apparently anyone can enter a professional dance competition, regardless of ability or training, and book making is a viable job option for the unemployed. When a person gets out of the institution, he or she is apparently assigned their own personal police officer who just happens to show up day or night, kind of like a personal on-call bodyguard. Oh, and having a cra-cra dad who obviously passed his mental issues on to his son but isn't called on it at all is just part of the insanity that makes up this ridiculous movie. But, hey, if a person dances long enough their mental issues go away and all is well.

I'll be shaking my head for a long time as I cannot believe how this movie is getting the press and reviews I've seen. Excellent actors in a beyond stupid screenplay. Complete waste of time and money.

At first glance, you would think this movie would be just another generic Katherine Heiglesque rom-com that dominates the box office and empties your soul. But classifying it as such is like saying Jaws was a nice little fishing movie. It's so very much more and what makes it all the more wonderful is that it comes as such a pleasant surprise.

I mean, seriously, who would have thought that Bradley Cooper could convey such angst and heartache? Or that De Niro still had a great performance in him after a decade of caricaturing his old self? And Jennifer Lawrence - just wow. There's so much more to say but best to just let you experience it for yourself.

Watch - this movie's rep will build through terrific word-of-mouth and it'll end up as a modern day classic. This is why you go see movies in the first place.

I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all, I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies, it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love, and styles you'll hate, find the ones you click with and never let go.

Silver Linings Playbook has generated a lot of hype since its worldwide premiere at TIFF, and frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it deserves all the praise its received. It is by far the best film I saw at the festival, and is easily one of the most memorable films of 2012. Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, Silver Linings follows the life of Pat (Bradley Cooper) as he moves back into his parents' house after spending months in a mental institution because of a violent outburst that occurred after he found his wife with another man. The movie follows Pat as he attempts to get back his life back, but he meets a new challenge as Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, who is completely girl crush worthy) finds his way into his life.

I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie more from beginning to end. O'Russell brilliantly tells a heartwarming, yet complicated and hilarious tale, that leaves you on the edge of the seat. The cast is wonderful, and all deserving of nominations in the 2012 award season. If people didn't know of Jennifer Lawrence before, they will now. She's quirky, complicated, hilarious, and you really just can't get enough of her. DeNiro also delivers a strong performance as Cooper's Philadelphia Eagle's loving, somewhat OCD father.

If there is one movie worth seeing this year, it's Silver Linings Playbook. The story may follow a family in a very serious situation, but we can all identity with the truth and emotions that comes with struggling through times. It's a story that's easy to connect with, and it's a film that will make you smile from beginning to end. Catch this movie when it comes out in November, and I promise you, you won't regret it.

Greetings again from the darkness. The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, Philadelphia Eagles fanatics, a ballroom dancing contest, adultery, Hemingway, and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect, but more likely much more.

If you were told instead that the story is based on two damaged souls who help heal each other through dancing, you would have every reason to skip this one. However, as written and directed by David O Russell (The Fighter) and based on Matthew Quick's novel, this story is a frenetic, emotional roller coaster ride that provides a glimmer of hope for the two damaged lead characters, while reminding that each of us may be a bit off-center in some way. Now add in the best young actress working today (Jennifer Lawrence just turned 22), a rare performance from Robert DeNiro where he seems fully engaged, a pulling back the curtain on Bradley Cooper as much more than a pretty face, and one of the best and most precise soundtracks in recent history ... now you have one of the best films of the year.

What you notice very early on is that what could be considered a trite story line, is instead pounding you with sharp, witty dialogue that pulls no punches in directness. The many aspects of family and emotional support are given time thanks to Pat (Bradley Cooper) being released after 8 months in a mental institution. He was sent there when he snapped after finding his wife in a compromising position with another man. Perfectly understandable if you ask me, but clearly he is the explosive one despite his claims to the contrary. An uncomfortable dinner party introduces him to Tiffany (Ms. Lawrence) whose husband has recently died and her coping skills have been shared with most of those in her workplace. This odd couple spark immediately and the wild ride begins.

Pat's wife Nikki (Brea Bee) has issued a restraining order and Pat's strategy to win her back involves a positive attitude and maintaining control of his emotions. His supporters include his mother (Jacki Weaver, who was so great in Animal Kingdom), his OCD father (DeNiro) who so wants to re-connect with his son, his friend (John Ortiz) whose own marriage (to icy Julia Stiles) is a messy mess, his buddy from the asylum (a funny and not over the top Chris Tucker), and of course, Tiffany. The only real problem is that each of these supporters are teetering in their own way just like Pat.

The brilliance of this movie is the balance struck between the near violent emotional outbursts and the sharp, exacting words spouted by each of the characters. Director Russell once again shows his flair for working class northeasterners. He understands these tough as nails people who wear their emotions on their sleeves. These people are as likely to punch you as hug you ... and both are acts of love.

The soundtrack deserves special mention. It is very unique and varied, with each song serving an exact purpose. Especially keen are Stevie Wonder's "My Cherie Amour", Led Zeppelin's "What is and What Should Be", and "The Girl from the North Country" a Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash duet. When the music strikes a harmony with the scene, the movie is all the stronger. Rarely do we get the perfect storm of script, direction, acting, music and relevance.

While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.

Written and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.

Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very cliché and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.

The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.

Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichés. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-

Wow, talk about a movie written to a well-worn Hollywood recipe.

There are 0 surprises is this movie. As soon as the two main characters meet at the dinner party the rest of the movie flows like a ad-lib.

Wow, she wrote the letter? What a surprise. Yawn.

Wow, they scored exactly what was needed to win the bet? Yawn.

Wow, he decides on the new girl instead of his old wife? Amazing, never saw that twist coming.....

And I thought M. Night Shyamalan had gotten bad at twists. Even my wife, who is a sucker for she flick comedies thought it was wayyyyy to predictable.

This movie was built up to be one of the best of the year. It couldn't have fallen shorter in my opinion!

From the first minute of the film you are subjected to people shouting at each other with some scenes incomprehensible! The sheer chaos of the dialog and filming was enough to make me physically ill to watch (my wife couldn't even sit through the entire film).

There was a thin story line with Cooper being obsessed with getting back together with his wife after leaving mental health care, but this story was both unbelievable and uncomfortable! She has taken out a restraining order on Cooper (Pat) and yet the police officer who comes to each scene seems to do nothing and leave with no real purpose in the story. 

If you are looking to see a movie with lighthearted humor and great acting (as we are led to believe by the trailer and reviews) the AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! 1 out of 10 for the dancing.

One star because zero stars isn't an option, nor is a black hole icon. I should know better than to dis this film, as most films I hate only draw comments from idiots. But for the sheer pleasure of it, I'll say this: I hated the writing, the acting (especially deNiro, who has been doing this same role for at least ten years and has apparently abandoned the use of his talent, and his wife-character), the characters themselves, the directing, the cinematography, the casting, the scenic design and the overall conception - where a "silver lining" is imposed on the story rather than grows out of it. I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other "moral" life choices, thought the entire film depended on "cute" writing and cliché (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes. By the way, the audience I was with, maybe 50 people, didn't laugh that much. What's not to hate? Over many years I've learned that many people often think something is funny if someone else tells them it's supposed to be. I'm not one. Now go ahead and trash me if you like. But if I can keep one person from seeing it I'll have done my duty. And if one other IMDb reader has the guts to agree with me: brother, (or sister) - welcome to the real world!

Over the past week I believed I had seen the most overrated film currently frontrunning the Oscars this year after viewing "Zero Dark Thirty." And then I discovered this abomination.

There is little to nothing to comment on regarding this film's script or story because when it is boiled down to its roots, it is a trite, cliché bore that has been done many, many times before and far better.

So what makes this movie not a complete copy of many films before it? This film contains a horrific depiction of mental illness that objectifies human beings as caricatures. Cooper's character, who is supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them. His 'character' is then propped up and 'fleshed out' through a collection of tired tropes typically seen in Hollywood's voyeuristic, disrespectful portrayals of those with mental illness.

Avoid this sickening film at all costs, especially if you are someone who suffers from mental illness or are related to someone who does. It handles its subject matter in a way that will disturb you to the point of tears before the movie is even over.

I really wanted to LOVE this movie, as I rarely get out to watch movies so I am very selective about the ones I will go watch. I love both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and the reviews have been so overwhelmingly positive I was sure I couldn't lose!

To me, this film is a typical clichéd rom com with some mental illness and character twists thrown in. Boy meets girl, boy and girl pretend to just be friends for a while, boy and girl get thrown into a situation where they have intense prolonged contact, boy and girl fall in love and end up together. YAWN. THIS is what is getting so much hype? 

I found Bradley Cooper to be magnetic and intense. Great work. I have enjoyed him since his small role in Wedding Crashers and thought he was just superb in Limitless. He is the best part of this movie. The guy is super talented! 

I really was not that impressed with the other performances despite the fact I thought I should be. To be fair, no one stunk it up or ruined the movie. But I thought anyone could have played the other roles. I like Jennifer Lawrence but I didn't think she was that great in this. I thought the parents were played well but again, I didn't think De Niro was that special in this. 

I'm not really sure I'd recommend this. I'd probably either wait for DVD or even cable. It's OK.

"I'm remaking myself." Pat (Bradley Cooper)

Silver Linings Playbook doesn't play by the current romantic comedy bookNo scatology, nudity, f-bombing, or feminist and gay bashing. It's simply a smart playbook about the mental institution's recently-released Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boy-man shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradley's new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).

But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. 

After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).

The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pat's relationship with that "slut," Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingway's ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know you're in a film that follows no particular playbook.

The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bi-polar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes. 

Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, you'll confirm she's one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year.

I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.

I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I had read about the plot and its depiction of mental health issues and I was hoping to see a wonderfully nuanced movie with people fighting to get well. Instead, this movie was clichéd and clumsy. It was a movie without direction, it had no playbook.

I'm going to assume that the book has more depth than the director cared to give the characters and that this is just a really poor adaptation to film. The characters are so incredibly flat and one dimensional and not at all a good representation of people with mental health issues. In fact, I think some damage was done here as not all depressed people get manic and destroy things at the drop of a hat or run out and sleep with a bunch of people. They're not all at odds with their doctors. There were just so many bad generalizations in this movie about the mentally ill I can't even list them all. The entire premise makes no sense. Why would you even set two people up who are at those points in their lives? It would be reckless to set up a woman still binging on sex with a man who was obsessed with his wife. I could go on and on. The entire story just didn't work. At all.

Aside from the script the film craft was one of the worst I've seen this year! I counted about 5 gaffs in the movie before it was even halfway through. These were not small gaffs but obvious things you'll notice and I'm not sure how the editor missed. In addition to that, the movie just didn't flow well either. The running scenes looking staged and lifeless. He wears a trash bag to work up sweat...but never seems to sweat. He was supposed to be out of shape, but is definitely not out of shape when they show flashbacks. So many gaffs.

I'm guessing people were just voting this movie highly because of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are attractive together. Their performances are OK, but the movie falls apart so thoroughly around them that it's unimaginable why anyone would enjoy this film.

This is my 1st review because I had to say something about this movie just to warn others about it since there are so many 10 star reviews. I sincerely do not understand what it is the academy saw in this movie to nominate it for 8... EIGHT Oscars! Are they paying them to nominate the movie?? 1. Bradley Cooper is not convincing as a bipolar patient. When I look at him all I can think of is his character from The Hangover or that he was voted Sexiest Man Alive. 2. Jennifer Lawrence is becoming one of my favorite ladies in Hollywood but she definitely was cast wrong for this part also. She is mean and unlikable and overacts the entire time. Just a lot of yelling and stomping around. 3. The entire movie they just bicker and huff and puff. They aren't cute until the very end and then the movie just ends. 4. There were so many football references and talking over one another that my ears started to hurt. The scenes would drag on with just arguing. 5. The plot was very bland so you aren't really rooting for anyone or excited about what is going to happen next. The script must have been a piece of cake to write because there really isn't anything groundbreaking here. There are hundreds of mental patient movies.

Just got back from theater with my wife and had to write.. My top genre is rom coms and i can enjoy the lamest and most predictable, but this is a real stinker. I can't believe people clapped at the end, morons. Other negative posts are right on editing, poor story line with weak motivations, but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be: comedy, quirky love story, family healing story, concern for the mentally or emotionally ill, Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or planned well so they threw it all in. 

All the actors did a good enough job but the support really let the movie down. I connected with the movie on 3 scenes only, the best being when the parlay deal is cut. Shame on Danny Elfman for the music, Led Zeppelin's "What Is and What Should Never Be" for that scene? Really? All in all I was ready to leave after about 40 minutes, but my wife lukewarmly enjoyed it so I had to stay. The word "Oscar" should not appear in the same sentence with the title of this movie as I see no one associated with it doing that level of quality work. Pathetic.

How do I find a bookie like the idiot played by Robert De Niro, who co- stars in the surprise hit movie Silver Linings Playbook?

Seriously, he's got to be the dumbest bookmaker on the planet. Any real bookie who followed his habits would soon be at an intersection holding up a cardboard sign.

Silver Linings Playbook is unquestionably the most overrated film of the year. How this two-hour bore garnered a whopping eight Oscar nominations isn't so much a testament to this movie's excellence, but rather what a terrible past year this has been for cinema.

The Bradley Cooper character meets the Jennifer Lawrence character at a dinner party and the rest of the movie is pretty much the story of the interplay between the two leads. They spend most of the time fighting and insulting each other, sometimes viciously. But none of this seems to matter. We all know what's going to happen just before the final credits roll.

But predictability is the least of this mess of a movie's numerous problems. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the story is Cooper's obsession with reuniting with his estranged wife. Remember, this man spent eight months locked up behind bars in a mental ward for committing a violent crime. Now, he's free on probation and his sole mission in life to to get back with the ex.

Trouble is, his wife has issued a restraining order against Cooper. That means he's not allowed to visit or call or contact her in any way. Despite this, Cooper ignores the law and goes to great lengths to go after what he wants. Sure. Nothing proves a man's true love like acting the part of a stalker.

For some reason I found baffling, many people seemed to find this endless pursuit to be an endearing quality -- including women. There were plenty of laughs as Cooper tries to establish some sort of contact with his ex, including visiting her place of employment. How charming! I guess being a wacko stalker is okay if you look like Bradley Cooper and were voted 2011's Sexist Man Alive.

The movie takes place in South Philadelphia. Accordingly, we're subjected to all the typical stereotypes you'd expect. The only thing missing was Burt Young as the uncle walking in the door with a sack of sausages.

There are a few nice moments, which were usually tied to the catchy soundtrack. And it's okay to dream and believe in fairly tales. But that doesn't mask the reality that relationships take work. They require sacrifice and commitment from both sides. Yet, we're led to believe that once the boy gets the girl, they'll leave happily ever after. Never mind that they've been screaming at each other for 90 minutes during the entire movie, and haven't agreed on anything. They have virtually nothing in common. Neither has a job or it would seem, much of a future. So, what's going to happen the first time Mrs. Lawrence tells Mr. Cooper to take out the trash? Or, leave the toilet seat down? Is Cooper going to go ballistic again like he did with his first wife?

So, let's get back to that idiot bookie. Remember -- Robert De Niro plays the dad. He lost his job some time ago, so he turned to bookmaking to support his family. Fair enough.

Trouble is, there's not one thing in this movie the least bit convincing he actually works as a bookmaker. On Sundays, the phone never rings. He never has a notebook at his side. Where are all his customers? He never once discusses games or point spreads, other than those involving his beloved Philadelphia Eagles when he's in action. In fact, De Niro is so sickly obsessed with the Eagles, he watches them religiously -- completely oblivious to games one which his livelihood depends. One might think that a bookie based in Philadelphia might have a rooting interest in Eagles' games, and if so -- he's likely want the other side to win (and cover) since most amateur locals tend to bet on their favorite team. But there's De Niro, the ultimate sap.

That said, the most laughable part of the movie comes near the end. I won't give away the final outcome. But De Niro essentially gambles his entire life savings on a single football game. Who does he bet on? You guessed it -- the Philadelphia Eagles.

A few scenes later, De Niro is back at it again. This time, he wants to bet a parlay. He learns that the line on the upcoming Philadelphia- Dallas game is "Eagles -1." De Niro wants to bet on his beloved Eagles so badly, that he offers his business partner and fellow bookie a preposterous wager. He says "I'll give you Dallas plus ten points! The Eagles must win by ten!"

On a game lined at "-1?"

This clown is a bookie?

How can I get in touch with this joker?

To be fair, I saw this movie in Las Vegas -- where sports gambling in commonplace. But the De Niro segment of the movie was so absurd and annoying, that I heard a few catcalls and even some uncontrolled laughter. Not good.

It's a bad sign when the most memorable thing about a movie are its flaws. But alas, those are pretty much the only parts of the film that kept me interested in what was an instantly forgettable and utterly disappointing film.

Silver Linings Playbook has about as much entertainment value as a losing sports book ticket.

Thought I would enjoy this film, unfortunately I didn't. You could see from a mile away that the main character was going to end up with the other women(yawn, seen this in other films). It was too long, well it felt like it for a 2 hr film, it kind of dragged on and on, and was hoping for the end to arrive. Deniro has done better work than this, Jacki weaver was good, and deserves the Oscar nom for her role, as for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, there was NO chemistry between the 2 leads, I thought His character was going to end up with his wife(ex-wife in the film), would of been interesting if they had of gone this way instead of the predictable outcome. Long on fluff, short on substance is Silver Linings Playbook.

First of all I want to say I really wanted to like this movie. I know it's a romantic comedy and it's not my favorite thing to watch but it has its moments. The trailer of this movie made me really want to watch it, a story about two depressed people whom meet up. As a person who has been depressed and suicidal for a large part my life this movie seemed like something that could bring up the frustration of being depressed and mentally ill. But was it? No, not at all. It made it a silly and meaningless plot point and it dumbed down feeling mentally ill to a small thing that doesn't matter and everyone can get over it in easy if they just want to. 

The movie begins great, the main character is being released from the mental institution. He wants nothing else than to get back together with his wife. He isn't sick he is functioning on a good level and hasn't realised that it is over. No one tries to have a sit down with him and tell him straight out that it's over. If they had done that this whole movie would have been done. They treat him like a five year old that no one wants to correct! And then there is the female main character, she is weird in fun way so it makes people laugh, but is it? No, her character is stupid. No one talks like this in the real world! Who wrote this dialogue? It's horrible, it's written by someone that have watched too many romantic movies and seriously believe just having a small thing in common makes them the best damn couple ever!

The main character's sickness is like a funny joke. I wanted some emotions, I could just think how much I hated him. He has one small breakdown and nothing else. 5 minutes is what sets up his whole character. If they hadn't said that in the beginning of the movie I would have never noticed. I would just think he was heart broken and wanted to get back together with his wife. No emotions at all! That is suppose to be the movie, struggling with emotions and mental sickness! Not having a god damn dance contest and at the end he declares his love for the girl! It was obvious it would happen that was not the problem, it's a romantic movie what did I expect? But they are not building up to it. "Oh, I have been obsessed with my wife this whole time but when I saw her I realised I didn't care about her, I care about you that I haven't shown any emotions to before!" Give me some emotions for god's sake, who the wrote this piece of garbage!? And the stupid plot point of having a big ass bet that the whole family relied on being a big deal and they are trying to push it like it's a big risk and no one knows what is going to happen, but we all know! This movie is so obvious with everything! I understand it's obvious, it's a romantic comedy. But give me a great journey and story of how/why they end up together! Give me some emotions between the choice of choosing between the wife and the new girl. It just happens in this movie it just does, whit no explanation to why/how he made the decision. The whole movie end with that if you get a girlfriend ALL of your troubles will go away and EVERYTHING will be perfect, LIFE DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT! This movie was made by people who has never had any emotional illness at all and that shows.

The movie is either average or horrible. The acting is average nothing really bad and nothing good. The dialogue is horrible, no person in real life would talk like this! The plot is interesting but the execution is horrible, they butchered the plot, no tension or struggle at all and it just flows in a bad way with a absolutely breath taking dumb ending. It had so much potential. The reason some romantic movies are good is because they the character needs to go through something emotional or make a hard decision in their lives. But nothing like that happens, the plot points just happens. I am maybe repeating myself here a lot but it really REALLY bothers me. How could this movie get Oscars nominated? When movies like Cloud Atlas or the great Joss Whedon gets left out completely. 

My final thoughts are: it could have been something great, a movie to be seen as the great romantic movie of this decade but it failed so hard in the writing and directing it is just horrible to watch.

Sorry to bring the joy down people, but I've been wasting my time for the last 2 hours... When you watch the trailer, you do know what to except of the basic story, the funny/weird romance, etc... what you don't know is how slow & weak the action & dialogs take place. It is so painful to see good actors led to play in such a disastrous direction. Main characters seem to play a caricature of a mentally ill person like "cuckoo's nest" basic redux, poor deniro seems to be stuck in the role of the good old grumpy/lovely dad/step dad for the last decade now. Actors are plainly hysterical, going in circle for the whole movie. I couldn't relate, not one bit. When you go to tragi-comedy genre, you expect to get emotionally involved, I was clinging to my seat after an hour trying to figure out if i had to laugh cry or just get out of the room... The staging & editing is extremely weird but not in the good sense. I wont mention about the American sport community thing, though it made them look all the more pathetic (ok i just mentioned it). Terrible. The last movie -and they are few -that gave me that feeling of total emptiness was "How Do You Know", boy i had hoped it would never happen again... well it is !!!

I expected this movie to be really good. Something else than the usual Hollywood stuff. The beginning was in line with the expectations. Looked promising, but that soon disappeared and eventually it was hard to watch the movie at all, but I did it, sometimes looking away. Especially the scene were almost everyone is in the house of the parents and they are talking about the bet that went wrong and what to do next. This scene really went wrong and there seemed nothing to do about it, but close my eyes and look away. The movie really collapsed there. The remaining of the movie was exceptionally predictable. I even got the jury-score right. Afterwards I couldn't think of any reason for this movie to be made except making money. The 8 here/92% (!) on rotten must be on a scale from 0 to 100/1000. Safe yourself the trouble, don't believe the hype and skip this one. It's a mixture of scenes from a lot of movies which never becomes 1 movie.

Dancing with PTSD

The Hollywood solution to mental problems. And WOW about everybody in this movie has mental problems. And that is probably the only thing I found realistic in this film.

The rest is so filled with clichés. First of all the two lead characters are super good looking. What else do you expect? We cannot have average looking people afflicted with bipolar or depressive disorders, can we?

And while in the real world people who have been diagnosed with bipolar and have been committed to a mental institution have a hard time to keep friends, the guy in this movie still has the support from everybody,but his ex-wife and her lover. Another astounding thing is that a lot of the main characters are out of work and seem to exist without problems. The answer may be that the father (De Niro) has turned bookie after losing his job. And I have to admit that I know so little about betting that the whole segment about the bet eluded me. I also have never been to a football stadium or watched a game (I guess, it was football) and after seeing the scenes at the stadium I certainly never will. 

Now we get to the part where dancing becomes the therapy. While I completely agree that physical activity is very important in coping with mental challenges, I seriously doubt that somebody without any dance experience can enter a competition, again, I am not familiar with these kind of competitions, but after what they showed it was not a segment of "So you think you can dance", where anybody gets a go. The dance scenes reminded me of that unfortunately also Oscar nominated movie "Black Swan" where the camera only showed the dancer waving her arms because she obviously was not a trained ballet dancer, and in this movie the dance scenes are so chopped that you get no idea what the girl wanted to achieve with her choreography. And then of course we have the typical Hollywood ending . Everybody is happy and boy gets girl, and daddy wins his bet and gets his diner and they live happily ever after screaming at each other. Because as Dr. Phil always likes to point out , you can always judge a person by his past behavior. I have no idea why this movie got all the nominations, but that is not the first time, that I am clueless.

Went to the Mill Valley Film Festival Opening tonight and viewed the film. Bradley Cooper spoke to the audience before the film started. The movie was fantastic. Such a great inspiring film for all. It makes me want to be a better person--for SURE!! Great story line. So passionate, reaches deep into the soul of family, friends, marriage, love, compassion, understanding of others, how we question ourselves and others. Wow, walked away just wanting to see it again. Robert DiNiro played a stunning role as did Bradley Cooper. It reminded me so much of home in WNY and family values. So much of what we forget about love, family and stopping to listen and see the signs. A must see for sure.

After a great beginning, describing pretty realistically the condition of a person with a mental disorder (in this case bipolar), the movie fails completely in the last 30 minutes, where the main character suddenly gets over his obsessions and finds true love, his family wins a lot of money and his friends manage to solve their emotional and mental problems in order to celebrate the happy-ever-after couple.

Personally I felt downright cheated and insulted by the cheesy ending. But the worst part is that many viewers will really believe that it is that simple to overcome a serious psychological illness (not only bipolar, but also like anxiety, depression, burn-out, OCD etc), and hence the movie is actually doing a disservice to anyone in this condition.In order to arrive at the happy ending described in the movie (which of course I wish to anyone going through such an ordeal), a huge effort, courage, support, treatment, discipline and time is needed in real life and I am sorry to say it does not happen by taking a bit of dancing lessons and reading a letter. 

Conclusion: good start, after which they throw a bucket of pink confetti over the two broken (now mended) main characters to make the audience feel good.
