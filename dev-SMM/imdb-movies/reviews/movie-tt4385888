### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
"20th Century Women" is the story of three women of different generations who help to see a teenage boy learn what it is to become a man.

The three women, (Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig, and Elle Fanning)become the primary influences in the life of Bening's son (Lucas Jade Zumann). Being is nothing short of fantastic as the mother, Dorothea, a product of the '40s and '50's, who is leading a bohemian-type lifestyle, and who rents rooms to Abbie (a photographer played by Gerwig, and a mechanic ( Billy Crudup). I would look for Gerwig and Crudup to contend for Best Supporting Oscars. Zumann is refreshing as Bening's son, Jamie.

Mike Mills("Beginners") has created a setting in 1979 that is easily identifiable and relatable. There are no plot twists or surprises, just interesting characters that actually talk and listen to each other.

20th Century Women isn't about giving us some epic look at a group of friends or a family, but it is about the passage of time with people who are warm and caring and in a genuine way. Mike Mills isn't a saccharine filmmaker, but he also doesn't shy away from sentiment - I always have to point out this is separate from sentimentality - and the feeling that I came away with from the comedy 20th Century Women is this warmth from all of the characters, and this feeling that I know these people, whether I did or didn't (and I actually did in the sense that, at times, the mother and son were me and my mom for a short period of my teenage years, so there's an authenticity just there to me).

There's so much empathy for everyone here that it adds to the authenticity of the emotions, even for Greta Gerwig's Abbie who is, in essence, another 'Greta Gerwig' character like I've seen, or think I've seen, in other movies (her quirky wisdom seems akin to last year's Mistress America at least). While she is my least favorite person in this movie, she's given a history and many moments, surrounding one of those terrible things that happens to people and there's not much to be done about it, or could've, it's out of the hands of anything *to* be done. There's so much work done on the characters here by Mills, getting us to like them despite all of their flaws or those moments where they don't act with logic or sense, that it doesn't matter that there isn't too much of a story. This is the story of these characters in a short span of time while also, as if looking on from some other, ethereal plane, about what this time meant in the context of what came before 1979, and what was to come.

Among the actors here, Lucas Jade Zumann is the breakout star as the 15 year old Jamie, but I was so taken with Benning and Fanning as the 50-ish, "she was in the depression" as she's described mother and the 2 years older than Jamie but that matters so much pleutonic friend respectively. I wonder if the film would've worked with any other actors in the roles, but really I can't imagine anyone else. Every time Bening's on screen she gives Dorothea this feeling of 'well... I guess this is happening now, what do I do about it, I'm not sure', and while she can get angry or concerned she's never one to go too over the top - this is the anti-Fences in that regard of being about a kid scarred by a parent - she does care about what happens to her son, with the "inciting incident" in screen writing terms being him almost dying from doing one of those dumb-s*** things teenagers do on a dare. It's a unique and subtle performance, filled with a sense of... questioning, uncertainty, which is harder to pull off than it looks.

Fanning, meanwhile, is also having to underplay, which is good to see. This is an impressive year for her between this, Live by Night (which she was the best part of) and the Neon Demon, and she's different in all of them. I want to say I like the work she does here the most even as (or because) it's the least likable one among the bunch (and keep in mind she's a born-again Christian in the South in LbN). Mills's writing provides Fanning a great deal to make Julie come alive, but I found her not saying things, the way she shows Jamie how to hold a cigarette, when she is saying little, and then when she is backed into doing something that she should want to do but doesn't go for - going past being 'just friends' with Jamie in the last third - how she responds is devastating. It's like, 'no, don't act this way', as opposed to simply looking at her as a "B"-word, which is how a hackier writer could've gone with it.

Oh, and I must reiterate this is a comedy, and it's funny as hell. There's certainly some dramatic stretches, but Mills mines a lot of humor out of generational splits - Bening's face as she hears early Black Flag, and then trying to "move" to it with Billy Crudup, is one of the funniest things this year - and it's a tricky balance that Mills finds between making the feminism (yes, actual literature and quotes spoken in voice-over from essays) serious AND humorous. We don't doubt that the feminism of the characters is pure, but there's also that question that's posed: how much is really appropriate, or can be legitimately understood, by 15 year old who barely knows who he is in this world? 

And on top of this Mills is having fun and some daring as a filmmaker, using psychedelic colors to show cars driving at times, and going not for the slow-motion but fast-motion speed, but not for comedy - the aesthetic point matches up with what the movie's about: life moves too fast, and we have to try and keep up with it best as we can and grow with things and become better people as everything moves too quickly. If it's ultimately too episodic to be anything really great or up to be there with the very best this year, I'd still tell anyone who likes smart character independent(ish) movies centered on teenagers and adults to see it immediately; it has a good place alongside The Squid and the Whale and, to a less taboo extent, Diary of a Teenage Girl.

"Guys aren't supposed to look like they're thinking about what they look like." Julie (Elle Fanning) 

No they're not, but in Mike Mills' 20th Century Women, some rules don't apply, and the young man, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), is well on his way to come of age in a most unusual household. It's 1979, before the Internet and Reagan and after the Punk rage. In other words, it's a time of cultural and personal transition.

No one is more responsible for this cultural migration in the Fields family than Dorothea (Annette Bening), a middle-aged matriarch with wit and lungs that will, in 20 years, surrender to the assault of her incessant smoking (her voice-over narration tells us so). Dorothea has the calm, contemplative, accepting nature to guide her two children, Jamie and Abbie (Greta Gerwig), into a responsible adulthood prefaced by sexual exploration and establishment defiance.

Although I rarely comment on acting, I must single out Bening for a performance of rich nuance, eschewing the theatrics of Oscar baiting to give us a character with immense affection and uncertainty, just like many of us, I suspect. Her low-key but powerful interpretation should get an Oscar nod.

While the examination of teen sexuality in flux is well described, so too is Dorothea's odyssey from a broken marriage to a Zen-like acceptance. As in the iconic Seinfeld world, nothing seems to be happening. However beneath that middle-class ambiance lie hearts struggling with their own shifting shapes under the watchful eye of family.

20th Century Women is all about the overwhelming part family plays in human development, not in grandly dramatic exercises but in the small notes like sitting in bed chatting or going with mother to a nightclub. As the credit sequence will tell you, life turns out fairly well despite the uncertainties of daily vicissitudes documented so distinctly here.

The scene feels remarkably familiar  Dorothea (Bening), the matron and saint of a Santa Barbara household circa 1979 leans in on her son Jamie (Zumann) listening to "Fairytale in the Supermarket" by The Raincoats. "They know they sound terrible right?" she says. Abbie (Gerwig), Dorothea's avant-garde lodger interjects; "yeah, but it's like they don't care. They got all this feeling but don't have the tools they need to express itit all comes out as passion." Dorothea fixates on Abbie's intonation, like listening to language she's only now grasping. She gets it...but then she doesn't.

Much like Abbie's defense of The Raincoats, Dorothea believes she has all the passion to be a proper mother, but she lacks the right tools to support a son who is growing older with each passing moment. She decides to enlist the help of two young women; Julie, Jamie's best friend and crush and Abbie a free spirit who was recently treated for cervical cancer. The only other man in the picture is William (Crudup) a well-meaning former hippie with a gift for mechanics and a passion for pottery. Between them all, the stalwart Dorothea hopes to quietly guide her son through his formative years which pit her depression era approach, to Jamie's recession era resentments. "Don't you need a man to raise another man?" asks Julie. "No I don't think you do." 20th Century Women starts with competing voice-overs and uses a collage approach to convey the surfaces of each character's inner life. The collages are stuffed to the brim with stills of 1930's gloom and 1960's turbulence all set to audio of proto-punk, Jimmy Carter's Malaise Speech and "As Life Goes By" from Casablanca (1942). It's an awkward mix; one that creates an echo chamber of sorts.

That subtle discordance of people talking at and not to each other, runs through the first half of the film. Jamie's coming-of-age story, a volatile mix of stubborn familial resentment and unrequited love clobbers together with Dorothea's own midlife crisis. "I had Jamie when I was 40." Dorothea says; a fact that can help explain Dorothea's free-range parenting approach, but also helps explain why Jamie's sharp insights cut so deep. For a while there it always seems like its Jamie versus Dorothea, pulled apart by an ever widening generational gap.

Then, like responding to the blessing of a wartime parlay, the factions in this film begin to center and calm. It is during this truce that the film begins to really take off, presenting its characters with vibrancy and humanity while flying through a more nuanced story arc. Almost independently both Jamie and Dorothea learn their goals are one in the same and the differences they have are little compared to their mutual respect for time which presents itself in rainbow tinged tracking shots and subtle fast-forwards.

And at the center of 20th Century Women lies the affable Annette Bening who suitably captures the zeitgeist of a generation no longer with us. While most might pigeonhole Dorothea as a madcap eccentric or worse a passive pushover, Bening wisely lets the character's inner strength shine through. Dorothea is unabashedly a one of a kind lady. She invites strangers to dinner, invites herself to punk clubs, leaves early, and then comes back days later alone. She verves uncomfortably with post-sexual revolution mores yet she quietly takes frank conversations about menstruation in stride. She does all this because she knows that with every encounter, every meeting, every stranger there's a chance for exchange.

Of course 20th Century Women is not without its problems. While Bening, Gerwig and Fanning all do wonders in their roles, Zumann fails to endear the young Jamie to the audience in any meaningful way. Part of it is due to the part as it is written. The film is loosely based on the life of director Mike Mills thus Jamie at times feels more like an avatar than a real teenager. Additionally it's ironic that despite constant paraphrasing of feminist literature, 20th Century Women would struggle to pass the Bechdel Test. Our three women characters orbit Jamie's life and analyze his actions and motives like he's the center of their universe.

Yet, while the film uses the wider Women's Liberation movement as window dressing, allowing the external conflicts of the film to melt away to reveal honest internal pain was a stroke of genius. Genius enough to maybe be interpreted as a meta-text on standard storytelling practices being a form of patriarchal oppression. That however is a discussion for another day. 20th Century Women is an artfully rendered film with plenty to say about the passage of time, the commonality between the generation gaps and the unifying love of mother and son.

"20th Century Women" (2016 release; 118 min.) brings the story of Dorothea, a divorced woman in her mid-50s, and her 15 yr. old son Jamie. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is "Santa Barbara, 1979", and Dorothea's car is engulfed in flames while she and Jamie were grocery shopping. When they finally get home, we also get to know Abbie, a 24 yr. old orange-haired photographer, and William, a Mr. fix-it-all, who both are renting rooms at Dorothea's house. Then there is Julie, the 17 yr. old who hangs out at the house for no apparent reason. When Dorothea feels she cannot handle the unruly(?) Jamie by herself, she enlists the help of Abbie and Julie. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the long-awaited new movie from writer-director Mike Mills, who last surprised us with the outstanding "Beginners" (now already 6+ years ago). Here he brings a character study of a group of 5 people in the late 70s. This movie immediately connected with me, as I saw pieces of myself in "young" people: Abbie (Born 1955), Julie (born 1962) and Jamie (born 1964). I was born in 1960. The movie features an all-star ensemble cast, with an almost unrecognizable Great Gerwig as Abbie (and on the heels of another outstanding role in the recent "Jackie"), Elle Fanning in perhaps her best role to date as Julie, Billy Crudup as William, and newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann as Jamie. Surely we have not seen the last of him. But the biggest applause must go to Annette Bening, who brings perhaps the finest performance of her career as the well-intended but at times confused, sad and/or lonely Dorothea. Mills brings us these characters in rich detail and nuance, much to the viewing public's delight. Ever wonder what a "cool cigarette walk" is like? You'll find out in the movie. Music plays a ventral role in the movie. There is a fine original score (mostly electronic) by Roger Neill, but even better are the song placements (Talking Head, Black Flag, David Bowie, the Clash, and many others).

"20th Century Women" premiered to great acclaim at the New York Film Festival last Fall. The movie opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely although by no means close to a sell-out. Doesn't matter. This is one of the finer movies of the year, for me anyway. If you like a richly-developed character study with an all-star ensemble cast, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "20th Century Women" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Elle Fanning uggh yes. Okay, now that that's out of the way lets get to this film. This seemed like an unconventional coming of age film and that is basically what this was. Its not a mindblowingly amazing film and has some flaws. However, what I thought was a flaw may have worked for another viewer. What I can say though, is that the film left a better impression on me than I thought it would.

The performances of this film are great, particularly that of Greta Gerwig and Annette Bening. Gerwig is such a real character who is pained but absolutely does what she wants to do in life. She has a hard time finding love but her very open nature makes her identifiable. Bening is tremendous in the best role I've seen from her. She's an easygoing mother who is worried about her son and how he deals with life. Remarkably cool but nuanced. Also, Elle Fanning good lord I love her. Okay, I had to get that out of my system again. All of the characters have substantial depth and you do not leave the film feeling like a character's story was underdeveloped. The main core of characters are all in close proximity with each other and through their interactions you get to see their turmoils, struggles, and comfortable nature with each other.

The stories of the characters of the film are at times told by themselves and they seem to be telling the story from a future time, where they have experienced the entirety of their lives. I liked this technique of expansive storytelling. However, there are other things in the film that don't work as well. The slideshow of images of the culture of the 70's seemed gimmicky and didn't exactly add to the film's narrative. It seemed like an attempt to be able to grab viewers but wasn't exactly necessary. There are also times where the scenes have a "psychedelic effect" where the car races off in the highway in a dreamy haze, full with the colors of the rainbow emanating from the car. Again, I thought this was quite gimmicky and trying to harden the fact that this film was supposed to be set in the 70s.

I think one of the things that worked with the film was its humor. There is a lot of it, and while its not always subtle and funny a good amount of it works to make you chuckle or really laugh. Its not something I was expecting but is definitely something that made the film more memorable. There are some scenes that really, really work and help you really want to live in the frame of the characters. The film really focuses on women at the time and a teenage boy trying to navigate in a sea of women in his life. While its not always accurate about men, I think its doing a pleasant job of trying to connect the two while showing some of the plights experienced when men and women try to understand each other. What you get here is a well acted, humorous films that works to entertain.

In late '70s San Bernardino, a Greatest Generation protofeminist, now a chain- smoking middle-aged long-divorced single mom with authority issues, Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening) is losing control of her fifteen-year old skate punk son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). They inhabit her creaking Victorian manse which is under continual remodeling (Symbol Alert!). To make ends meet, Dorothea rents rooms to Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a brooding twenty-something hipster and recent cancer survivor, and William (Billy Crudup), a handyman, mechanic, and New Age seeker who can't accept the end of hippiedom and grow up. Joining this merry band is Julie (Ellie Fanning), a lonely pouting brat two years older than Jamie who hates her family (natch), sleeps around (a lot), and spends most of her free daytime hanging out at Dorothea's house and her nights in Jamie's bed (it's not what you think!). 

Free spirits, let us call them all.

The tension comes from Jamie's emerging but directionless young manhood. Dorothea is a loving but incompetent parent, and the father has long since abandoned the boy. But at least she gets it that Jamie now needs more guidance than she can give him. William is too much a loser to be of any help, so she enlists Abbie and Julie to serve as Jamie's mentors (mentrices?). Julie asks the film's core question: "Don't you need a man to raise a man?" To which Dorothea (beating Murphy Brown by twelve fictional years) replies, of course, "No, I don't think you do." Well, let's see how that works out.

Abbie introduces Jamie to the fading punk scene and to feminist literature dealing mostly with female sexual satisfaction. The result is a lot of pointless anger, noise as music, and Jamie's growing obsession with  oops, I meant "awareness of" women's genital fixtures. To help him further along this path, Julie steals Dorothea's car, she and Jamie rent a motel room and, oh, you'll just have to see for yourself, won't you?

In weird first-person epilogues, the main characters all tell you how their lives will turn out ten or twenty years hence. Happy, married, and with children, mostly. The takeaway seems to be fundamentally conservative yet with more than a mere nod to feminism: traditional (the now-requisite adjective) marriage and family are the norm to which we snap back, even after periods and episodes of error and oddball experiment; yet feminism has taken some of the starch out of that stiff standard. And yes, because of it a young man becomes a better man, the "sensitive man" of certain feminist plans (see Mansfield, Harvey C., Manliness [2007]). Or maybe it's just that a parent's love makes up for most parental failings. With a little help from our friends. 

And the house? Like Humphrey Bogart (a running allusion), it belongs to another, more self-certain age, an age Dorothea is trying to restore, if only in its outward forms, while her life itself is being rehabbed by the social, sexual, technological, and political constructions of the times. 

Is it a comedy, really? Nah. More of a "sweet lost mood" pic in homage to the director's mom. The acting is completely convincing, though, so much so that you find yourself coughing and swatting the cigarette smoke away. Worth seeing, but without lasting effects.

Obviously there are two versions of this film in theaters. The one I saw was unbearably slow, boring, badly acted, horribly edited and scored. If someone put a gun to my head and told me to sit through this again, I'd take the bullet and end my misery quicker. Letting Annette Benning look dowdy and her age apparently is being mistaken for acting, while the rest of the cast, all good actors, are left to wander without benefit of dialogue or plot. There seems to be a stab at defining feminism in the 1970s, but good luck if you can figure out the point. The owner of my local theater told me that they were yanking this dog as soon as they contractually could, noting "the managers of the chain should have known better."

'Beginners' was good. Let's remake that... but different. Oh! I know, I know... 'The Kids Are All Right', that was good, too. Mashup time? I THINK SO! And we'll make it pretty so we don't have to bother with any actual plot nonsense - ain't nobody got time for that! OMFG, how about we make the characters completely unnatural and unrelatable by giving them some bullshit dialogue, too? I mean... If we mix it up with choppy voice-overs and still imagery it's going to be so totes metaphilosophical! I can already see the comments!

BEAUTIFUL! GENTLE! THOUGHT-PROVOKING! NOSTALGIC! EMPOWERING! AN IMPORTANT CASE STUDY ON HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS! SOULFUL! EDGY!

...And utterly, boringly pretentious. Fact: it tired me out so much, I can't be arsed with properly reviewing it which, in this case, is this film's only win. And now I'll just go ahead and forget it.

Reading the reviews of this bore-fest movie, I thought it was going to be this wonderful coming of age movie that would not only entertain but maybe even enlighten....NOT!!! I understand that the acting was good, which it was, but when do you watch a movie strictly to review the acting? NEVER!! This story is so slow, so boring, so meaningless that to give it any consideration for viewing is a huge mistake. I think the writing is so poor I'm amazed this ever got to the big screen. A great cast cannot and will not turn poor writing into a good movie.

I kept thinking that at some point the movie theme and direction would straighten out and actually engage me....WRONG. This way too long of a movie never finds it lane, there is (in my opinion of course)just nothing here worth watching.

Mike Mills's look at a moment in time and the glimpse of a generation of people is beautiful, charming, and funny. Dorothea (Annette Bening) raises her son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) in their house amidst the punk revolution and a remodeling. Dorothea brings on a border Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and has a handyman William (Billy Crudup) work around the house as influences for young Jamie. The neighbor Julie (Elle Fanning) also visits frequently and sleeps next to Jamie though she prefers to be just friends despite his blooming sexuality.

When Jamie faints during a dangerous breathing game and does not wake up for half an hour, Dorothea worries about his upbringing. She asks the two other women in his life to help raise him so that he will be a man that can find happiness. The movie doesn't follow any distinct plot allowing the film to capture the events of each characters life but also hindering it from building up towards any emotional climax.

Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Mike Mills has found a niche, and a form of therapy, by exploring and exposing his life in a most public manner  on the silver screen. Beginners (2010) brought us the story of his father's (an Oscar winner for Christopher Plummer) late life pronouncement of homosexuality. This time, Mr. Mills turns his lens and his pen towards his mother, and he seems to understand her much better in retrospect than in the summer of 1979 when the film is set.

This can be viewed as the story of three women, masked as a coming-of-age story for a teenage boy. Annette Bening stars as Dorothea, a chain-smoking single mother in her mid-50's who seems to have surrendered to her own sadness and loneliness, while simultaneously trying to make sense of a changing world. One of her tenants is Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a photographer and NYC punk scene drop-out, who is now battling cervical cancer. The third female is the seemingly always present Julie (Elle Fanning), a sexually promiscuous and borderline depressive 18 year old who values the platonic friendship she has with Dorothea's 15 year old son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zuman).

Factor in another tenant in the form of laid-back handyman and former hippie William (Billy Crudup), and we have a makeshift family in a communal setting that seems almost normal for 1979 Santa Barbara. Dorothea enlists the other two women to show Jamie their lives  the intent being to influence his growth in ways an older mother can't. Of course, Jamie is at the age where exploring life isn't necessarily best served by tagging along on a trip to the gynecologist with Abbie or having no-touch sleepovers with Julie.

Ms. Bening finds her groove as the story progresses and we feel her struggling to connect to each of the characters. When William plays a Black Flag song, her reaction is priceless: "They know they're not good, right?" She doesn't mean it as a put down, but rather her attempt to understand why her son is drawn to this. An even more emotionally naked moment occurs when Jamie is reading a passage from "The Feminine Mystique" to his mother. It's a passage that captures what he thinks of her, as well as what she thinks of herself  a mostly invisible woman finding it difficult to be a parent while also maintaining a self.

Mills is not one to be nostalgic or glorify the past. His brilliant writing includes lines like "Wondering if you are happy is a great short cut to being depressed." The movie can be slow moving at times, but it's the best I've seen in awhile at expressing what makes us tick. The film is what Running with Scissors should have been. Real people are sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, and sometimes annoying. Each of the characters here are all of the above (just like you and me).

Just like the central character in this film, I was born in 1964. Just like him, I was 15 in 1979. My mother was only two years older than his mother. So, you'd think I could relate to this film. But I couldn't, really.

Maybe that is because I didn't grow up in a bohemian single parent household in Santa Barbara. Life for 15 year old Jamie was different than it was from me. I had two parents, but I didn't have a skateboard.

Yes, I can remember Jimmy Carter being president. But I didn't see his impressive and remarkably modern 'Crisis of Confidence'-speech, which is an important feature in one of the scenes of this film. There's only one thing which caused somewhat nostalgic emotions: making mix tapes. Yes, I did that too.

'20th Century Women', which is essentially about a mother raising a son, has nice scenes. I really liked the explanation about punk rock music to the 55 year old mother: she complains about the lack of beauty, but exactly that is the strength of it. There are many such scenes, with small but meaningful events, telling a lot about how life was in the seventies.

But the story itself didn't captivate me. Jamie's mother thinks she can't raise Jamie on her own, so she involves his best friend (a girl) and a photographer who rents a room in the house (also a girl). They teach him lots of things about sex, music, seducing women, and life in general. All characters are in a way in search of there own destiny. So, a lot of soul searching is going on. Anyway, the film contains one of the best one-liners I've heard in years: 'Wondering if you're happy is a great shortcut to just being depressed'.

In addition to the high school boy coming of age, his mother is coming to old age. She looks more like a grandmother then the mother. If awards are given for smoking she's the winner.

Outstanding performances highlight this comedy drama. The movie seems a little long as it suffers from the written and directed by syndrome. The director wouldn't cut a minute of the brilliant script. Some scenes are redundant. How long is too long to discuss menstruation at the dinner table? Perhaps we didn't need to see the back story of every character in the movie. The voice over of what happened to everyone was interesting and quick.

The movie is in very limited release and even though it's flawed it's worth tracking down. If you can't find it in a theater enjoy it on a home platform.

Mike Mills hits a home-run with '20th Century Women'. Mills, with the help of an Astonishing Annette Bening, creates a film (based in-part on Mills' childhood) so emotionally powerful, its impossible not be moved by it. 

'20th Century Women' Synopsis: Dorothea (Annette Benning) seeks the help of Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and Julie (Elle Fanning) to raise her son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). 

'20th Century Women' is about relationships, primarily of a mother and son. Mills delivers a personal story with genuine feeling. I loved the other dynamics as well. The characters of Abbie & Julie are strong as well. You watch 3 women in different age groups, help a boy know a little more about life. They speak differently, their relations to the boy are vastly diverse, but they're women, who define feminism & the practicalities of life. Mills keeps the narrative heartfelt & by the time this story ends, you're with the characters & you feel for them. Mills' Screenplay, which has earned him a Very-Worthy Oscar- Nomnation, is superior. The Writing is super-strong at all times. I don't recall a single moment when the film lost me, I was with the film throughout. Mills' Direction is simple, but well-done. Cinematography & Editing are super. Roger Neill's Score is perfect.

'20th Century Women' is embellished with maddening performances. Annette Benning steals the show & how! Her portrayal of a mother trying to her raise her son without a father, is beyond marvelous. Its hard to keep eyes off the screen when Benning is up. Benning has delivered several memorable performances in her fabulous career, but in '20th Century Women', she surpasses herself. And to the Academy, what in the world made you not nominate her? If this isn't acting of the highest order, then what is? 

Following Benning, are Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig, Lucas Jade Zumann and Billy Crudup. Fanning is a treasure. She delivers a restrained, believable performance from start to end. Grewig, a criminally underrated performer, is only getting better with every film. She's fabulous here & the attitude she carries to portray a women fighting a serious illness, is nerve-wracking. Zumann is natural to the core & his scenes with Benning, are the emotional core of the film. Crudup, sandwiched between 3 beautiful women & a rebelling teenager, is a delight. He gets a smaller roll compared to the others, but he leaves a solid impression. 

On the whole, '20th Century Women' is A Wonder Of A Film. Two Big Thumbs Up!

What a shame that it seems like this film has gotten lost in the shuffle. It's so well written. It's also pretty clever in its structure. Rather than a more conventional storytelling approach, the film is first presented as a series of scenes that are introduced in voice-over by the various characters. I think the film does a great job of presenting so many of its ideas and issues this way and it allows for a really organic way for the character to develop. I was a bit surprised by its actual plot as well. The film uses the simple background plot of a woman's relationship with her son to also be about the various issues facing these very different women in this very pivotal, specific moment in their lives. The acting by the whole cast is pretty fantastic. Both Gerwig and Bening should be in contention for awards, and Fanning and Crudup should also be in the conversation. Really fantastic film.

What I loved about 20th century women was how evocatively it built the atmosphere of the time it was representing. The film was a sensory mood board of features from the years it captured and I really felt I was experiencing a passionately curated dip into the past. The films keeps up the momentum of engaging narrative, music and visuals and even the small intimate moments captivate the attention. I always love an unconventional pairing within a story and there was a sensitive exploration of relationships within this film which where fascinating because of the clever combination of differences. I Loved the matriarchal mother Dorothea she was a brilliantly tough sharp minded woman but her character highlighted the repressively resolute attitudes from the older generation within the set time of the film. In one scene, even an older woman as forward thinking as Dorothea didn't want to address the stigma of menstruation or the freedom women should have to talk about sex when two young female characters try to open up, and it really reflected the teething period of quickly changing ideologies. The film was a refreshing break from all the motivational career pursuit films, as the lives of the characters seem happily enriched through the exploring of literature and art in their own homes. The end sequence was unexpectedly emotional and gave a lot of wisdom to mull over!

Mike Mills is a music video producer, graphic designer and writer/director of documentaries and feature films. He has made music videos for Yoko Ono, Moby and Air. He has done album art for the Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth and Ol' Dirty Bastard. He also makes posters and fabrics as part of a series of works called "Humans by Mike Mills". Why this biographical sketch of Mike Mills? Well, it might help you understand his films. Two of the first three features that he wrote and directed (not counting 2005's "Thumbsucker") are semi-autobiographical. His 2010 film, "Beginners" is about his father who came out as gay late in life (a role which won Christopher Plummer an Oscar). Mills' 2016 feature, "20th Century Women" (R, 1:59), is about his mother, a role that earned Annette Benning some awards season love.

In 1979 Santa Barbara, Dorothea (Bening) only has one child and she's divorced from the boy's father, but she still has a house full of people. Besides her 15-year-old son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), there's the boarder she took in, a 20-something photographer and cancer survivor named Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and William (Billy Crudup), the middle-aged handyman who is gradually renovating Dorothea's 75-year-old house. Then, last but not least, there's 17-year-old Julie (Elle Fanning), who doesn't technically live in the house but might as well, as she often climbs in through Jamie's bedroom window to talk and sleep with him, as part of a very close but platonic friendship. Dorothea also frequently invites near-strangers over for dinner, such as someone she meets at a music club or local firemen who help her out of a jam.

As a mother, 55-year-old Dorothea is loving and devoted, but also insecure and kind of clueless. She's deeply concerned about raising her son to be "a good man" in the absence of a regular male influence. (She rarely dates and William and Jamie don't really connect.) Dorothea's solution is to ask Abbie and Julie to help her raise her son. She wants Julie to look out for Jamie and Abbie to share her life with him. Both are a bit confused by the request, but agree to do what they can. Abbie lends Jamie some feminist books from a college class she took, Julie teaches Jamie to smoke like a man, and neither of them is shy about talking with Jamie about sex. Jamie keeps insisting that he's fine, but his world does begin to expand, just as his mother also comes out of her comfort zone to experience more of the modern age.

"20th Century Women" is boring and basically pointless. The film is billed by Mills as a love letter to the women who raised him. (Besides Bening's portrayal of Mills' mother, Gerwig's character is loosely based on Mills' sister.) Most of us were raised by a mother and/or had strong, loving female influences in our lives to whom we owe a great deal, but few of us would expect people to sit for two hours learning about the women who nurtured us. It's not that Dorothea is uninteresting as a character, but she doesn't come off as any more interesting than my own mother, for example. What's more, there doesn't seem like there's much to learn from Dorothea's permissive and scattershot parenting style and, excepting the epilogue voice-overs at the end of the film, none of the characters really grow much  or have the potential to inspire us very much. The acting is excellent (especially Bening), but that does little to entertain when it's in the service of an otherwise unimpressive film. "C-"

This was a pretty dull and pointless self-indulgent film that was only made interesting thanks to Annette Benning's talent and the soundtrack (especially if you were ever into the punk scene). Other than that, most of the delivery is bland and dull, the story basically goes nowhere, and I didn't really care much about the characters fate (although I did smile when they talked about Abbie's ending). 

The story basically revolves around the life of a teenage boy in suburban Southern California, who lives with his mom, two renters, including an artsy woman who gets him into the punk scene, and an aging hippy man who doesn't say much of interest. He also has a girl who is close to him, but doesn't have sex with him. However, she often talks about her other sexual partners, which is a source of obvious frustration for him. 

There is really nothing special about this family at all, and their conflicts and "struggles" are so ordinary, so bland, so suburban, so narcissistic that I just didn't give a crap.

This might be appealing to those who remember the late 70's, and the punk scene, but otherwise, it's not worth your time.

Dreadfully boring. As a woman who grow up in that era, had a son about the same time, the superficiality of this film was beyond tolerable. I thought when the first historical footage was shown that there would be a little hint of connection to a more substantial indication of plot. But there was none. Little snippets of sex before birth control was readily available, and vague connections to the opening of the sexual revolution of the 70s. A bit of the roommates sharing houses, casual sex, therapy sessions, but nothing to maintain interest in the characters or their lives. One or two cute references "Birkenstock" sandals ( which I still wear!), skateboarding, restoring old houses, but in general left me unconcerned with any thing happening on screen.

"Don't you need a man to raise a man?" Dorthea (Bening) is a single mother trying to raise her son Jamie (Zumnn) in the 70's. She is struggling to find herself and when Jamie starts to transform into a man she isn't sure what to do. She asks for help from two other young women and together they try to steer Jamie in the right direction. This is a movie that is just not meant for me. The acting is great and the movie is good, but I just could not ever really get into it. There didn't seem to ever be a plot that developed and it seemed to just go from random idea to random idea with no real semblance of connection. Halfway through the movie feels likes it ending, then goes on for another hour. I'm sure many people will love this movie but this seemed to be artsy for the sake of being artsy. Overall, a movie with great acting, but one I just could not get into at all. The movie wasn't really made for me, demographically speaking, though. For what its worth, I give this a B-.

Big disappointment. There is zero dramatic tension in this leisurely-paced coming of age, homage-to-Mom film. A period piece set up the coast from LA near Santa Barbara in the late 1970's, it is the tale of a 15-year old boy and his single Mom who is worried he needs help becoming a man. So she fills the household with helpers. The characters talk and talk and talk and Bening smokes and smokes and smokes and by the end of the film you wonder why anyone backed this rather self-obsessed little indulgence. Bening is the center of attention, and she tries hard, but she wears as much as she delights as Mom. The other characters seem like stage props with lines. I found it hard to get with most of them. Several people walked out of the screening I attended. I was tempted.

Sincere, poignant & amusing, often at the same time, 20th Century Women is an honestly sketched vignette of five different individuals, each broken in their own individual ways, and also doubles as a quiet meditation on life & its unpredictable nature that is further strengthened by its stellar cast & their colourful performances but it still left me with mixed feelings.

Set in Southern California during the late 1970s, the story of 20th Century Women mainly focuses on Dorothea, a single mother who is unable to connect with her son anymore, and enlists the help of Abbie, an aspiring photographer who lives in the same house, & Julie, her son's best friend, to share the burden of his upbringing. The plot covers their struggles & adventures as time passes.

Written & directed by Mike Mills, the most impressive thing about 20th Century Women is that the characters inhabiting its world are all well-defined & embedded with full-fleshed arcs. All of them are believable, their struggle & frustration is relatable, and the conversations between them carry a lifelike quality to it. The plot is character-driven, everyone gets enough screen time, and it remains firmly grounded at all times.

The free spirited vibe of the 1970s, that era's prospering culture, and themes of love, freedom & sexuality are beautifully portrayed. Radiating a deep sense of warmth with its bright colour palette, the images brim with bohemian textures. The incorporated songs bring flavours of their own while staying true to the depicted timeline. Editing allows the events to unfold at an unhurried pace but its glacial pace & offbeat tone may turn a few viewers away.

Coming to the performances, 20th Century Women features a terrific cast in Annette Bening, Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup & Lucas Jade Zumann, and every single one of them embrace their characters wholeheartedly. Bening chips in with an outstanding showcase in the leading role, Gerwig is at her very best here, Fanning is equally amazing in her role, Crudup is surprisingly warm-hearted for a change while Zumann does really well with what he's given.

On an overall scale, 20th Century Women rarely does a thing wrong over the course of its runtime and yet I'm not as enamoured by it as everyone else seems to be. It features an interesting premise, the performances are laudable, and certain aspects do stand out but it still failed to make the desired impact plus there were times when I was bored by it. Movies that I admire more than I love have surfaced on my radar from time to time and, from the looks of it, 20th Century Women is the latest addition. Nevertheless, do give it a shot.

A coming of age story of a teenage boy that is a substitute for the film's director, Mike Mills, this kind of story has been done to death quite frankly. The difference here is the tale of an art school kid who discovers what life is all about through his kooky mother (beautifully played by Annette Benning) who tries to understand his bizarre music choices (a soundtrack full of the best of 1970's punk music), totally works as an authentic trip. It works all of the characters are very well fleshed out, it works because of the way the movie is split into different segments for each character, and it's just great screen writing. At the end of the day, wanting to spend more time with this dysfunctional family is a very good sign and a journey I want to take again very soon. It helps that the soundtrack is one of the best ever created as well.

This is a lovely, gentle, beautifully observed piece of nostalgia - perfect Sunday afternoon viewing. It also reminds you what a treasure Annette Bening is, and how easily she can create truthful, real yet conflicted female characters on the screen. The increasingly impressive Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig are also great. The icing on the cake is Billy Crudup, who always seems to make interesting choices which serve the story rather than his ego as an actor.

I loved taking the trip back to the 70s, listening to Talking Heads, imagining how exciting New York must have been around then. I loved the detail of the interconnected stories and hints at how complicated being a woman can be. Recommended to anyone with a mother or grandmother or any other woman in their life that they have loved.
