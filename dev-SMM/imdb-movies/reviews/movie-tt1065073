### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Seldom has there been a film where the critic's opinions and its true quality diverge so seriously. "Boyhood" is empty because it lacks content and form. It celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary. As a result, it embraces nothingness and is in that sense deeply nihilistic and even depressing. Anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or (more likely) a better one.

Those who praise the film always point out the same circumstance (the only thing they can say) which is: This film is like "real life". I have to say: This is true (on the most superficial level imaginable). But I may ask: Is that a good thing? Is this, if film history has taught us anything, what a film should be? "Real life", according to Linklater, means a lifespan during which nothing happens. The Boyhood-experience is the equivalent of your experience waiting in line at the supermarket. Yes, this is the "real life" Linklater presents us. NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE! Nothing, no story, no interesting characters, just ordinary situations from "real life". Of course, there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great (Tarkovsky's "Mirror", Antonioni's "L'avventura" or Tarr's "The Turin Horse" come to my mind), but you need ideas (you got that, Linklater?), you need a style or form which cannot be separated from the content, you need a capable director that can create a form of visual communication. Boyhood offers none of those things. The film gets praised especially by those who have never seen an art-house movie and mistake it for an art film. People are misled so easily. Boyhood is pure blankness, shallowness, superficiality, nothingness.

To praise Boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value.

Boyhood is in fact an anti-film in the sense that it stands against everything film should be - be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining, fun movie. The film is neither a work of art nor entertaining. In that regard it can be called a non-film. It celebrates its own non-existence and drowns in its nihilism. I doubt this was Linklater's intention but it certainly is the result of what he created.

Be warned: This is NOT a drama. The movie is the opposite of a carefully constructed work of art. It's nothing but a re-enactment of memories, a collection of unmeaning scenes we may or may not know from our own lives (bowling, playing video games, reading Harry Potter etc.). I think it is only fair to ask: What is the point? I went to see this film having high hopes and (having read all the raving reviews) expecting a masterpiece from Richard Linklater, the director of the great "Waking Life". I liked the trailer which makes the movie look much more interesting than it actually is (actually, everything that "happens" in the movie is already in the trailer!). The basic idea of filming a boy growing into a young man during twelve years is interesting, yes, but sadly the film offers nothing more than that. This is not enough! Sadly, many critics seem to have liked the basic idea so much that to them it didn't even matter if the director would be able to make it interesting or not.

The film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of Mason, a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever. The intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person. Mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep; he has no ambitions. At some point he gets his first kiss, gets interested in photography (the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people) during high school (haven't we seen that already too many times?), goes to college at which point the film ends. I kid you not, this is the whole movie. The mother becomes a teacher at a local college and always seems to attract the wrong guys. The father is an unemployed loser who only talks about pop music and ends up being a square. Mason's sister (the director's daughter) grows up too and that's pretty much all you can say about her.

It is actually impossible to spoil this film because nothing happens (unless you consider the fact that Mason finishes high school a spoiler). Linklater completely fails to dramatize his ideas. As a result, following this movie feels like watching family home videos of a family you do not care about - just with better picture quality.

Instead of using form (or content/drama) to make the film interesting, "Boyhood" refuses to do just that and therefore remains superficial.

You don't get to the essence of "real life" by only showing the surface of things. Everybody could do that!

It is really hard talking about this film because there isn't a single interesting character or scene in it. You just follow ordinary events in the lives of these people. Stay away from this movie!

Yes, this review will get negative votes, just because I didn't like the film, unlike the critic's union. Well, none of those "critics" were able to offer a single insightful argument that would speak for this non-movie. In fact, many even admitted the film lacked interesting characters or style! But because of the 12-year-gimmik, they call it a "masterpiece". Give me a break. I would be willing to debate any of these pseudo-intelligent "critics" and tear them into pieces. Over and out.

BOYHOOD...What a great movie! I simply believe in America again! They are also humans, guys, trust me:) Its obviously doesn't matter if you are an American, German or Russian. There are the same problems, the same ways, the same love inside us. As a Russian I must say I understand American people and also myself much much better with this movie. It was like... about me... I just COULD NOT imagine how much we are all the same.. Just love it!﻿ If I look at my childhood in the former USSR I see not much difference, the cars and houses are different, we spoke Russian, but that feeling, that pulse of life, that sometimes "lost" fathers and mothers to solve every day problems, fighting for the existence and good life for the children are so familiar to me.. That long hair and piercing.. Oh boy, its all so much alike. And those "Paul was greater than the others...". The movie is just breathing, its a three hours of fresh air!

I do not want to say much about the qualities of the movie.. It is overall brilliant. I do believe, this will be a classical film, and students all over thew world will study it in future at their film schools. P.S. Sorry for my poor English.

This is the Emperor's New Clothes all over again. The movie runs two hours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years, and believe me, it seems like 12 years. There is nothing of interest in the film. It is about nothing. Nothing happens, except children grow up, parents grow up, children make friends, parents marry again and again. No drama, no humor, no sadness, no happiness.

Just boring people leading boring lives, and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow, is just that, a gimmick. The boy of the title is a slacker, seeking meaning by doing nothing. Save your money, and more important, save your three hours and see another movie, any other movie.

One of the more overrated films lately.

The good: production, shooting, editing, sound -- were all good.

The great: the idea of following the same boy and others for 11 years. Transitions from age to age were beautiful.

The tiresome: the acting. It was OK, but nothing that grabs you. Ellar Coltrane was at his acting best when he was young, but gradually got more stilted. This could have been due to the director more than to him.

The ugly: The script. Existential drivel, over and over. Every character was written in a way that remained two-dimensional, especially his sister and mother. Ethan Hawke as his father did the best job of any of them in bringing some depth of life to his role.

Pretty much all movies, which I ever liked, are highly rated on IMDb. Although not all highly rated movies on IMDb are movies which I like. And this is one of them.

The movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point. Cool. That's it. Nothing else.

It was a cliché scene after cliché scene for almost three hours. Three hours which I'll never get back :) I'd rate it with negative 3, but there's no rating lower than 1.

Sometimes, a movie starts bad. It goes on for a while, but then, at the end, something new and unique happens and you think: "Oh! I totally did not expect that. So it was worth seeing it". Well. Not now. Bad start, middle, and end. Oh, he met another girl. Really. They like each other? Is this how people who like each other act?

The acting was so poor and just about every line said, was said in so unnatural way. Real people in real situations, simply do not look like or act like that. I felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters. None of them seemed to have any social skills.

None of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives. They had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations. The plot for such conversations goes like: "blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blah".

This film blew me away and it is hard to describe why. Seeing it together with 1,500+ captivated and enthusiastic people at one of the Berlinale Friedrichstadt-Palast screenings surly helped. Yet, what makes this film so unique and touching is its deep humanity. Although it is a fictional piece, you can't help not to relate to the actors as if it would be a documentary. Every scene feels like real life. I know that this is not necessarily a good thing to say about a movie but it is meant as a compliment.

The actors deliver an outstanding performance. While much has already been said about the main characters, I was also deeply impressed by the performance of the side characters as well. As an example, the actor of the second husband of Olivia excels in one of the most emotionally straining scenes of the movie. The dialogs are touching and feel just natural. There are so many scenes and details in the movie where you feel unbelievable close to the actors. When Patricia Arquette says as mother Olivia "I thought there would be more" you instantly think about your own (family) life and its constant flux.

I surely hope that this movie will make it to as many screens as possible. Also, I hope that no distributor will force additional editing on it. It is perfect as it is and worth any minute. If you like people in general and families in particular, you will love this movie.

So the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years. Wow, yeah, crazy. You know what else happened over a period of 12 years? Lots of nothing to lots of other people, just like in this movie, in which nothing freaking happens.

12 years and this is what they came up with? For crying out loud. This movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an Arkansas corn field for 12 years. Maybe my life's so much more interesting than everyone else's who gave this movie rave reviews. Are people so boring that it's now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? And the guy is gay! Didn't anyone else notice that? I've nothing against gay people but we're supposed to believe he's straight. Come on. If that'd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there: look, he's finally coming out of the closet. Shocker! 

And what did these people have against hair brushes? Maybe it's too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening, a hint of not so awfully-boring-why-God-did-I-agree-to-watch-this-?! I want a refund.

The idea of the film is great, they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored, however I feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together. Forgive me if I've missed anything, but I feel that I spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude, ill-mannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life. I spent the entire film looking for the "beauty" or "the message" in this "masterpiece" and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up, nothing bloody happened.

My definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something, which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration, something which makes you think about an interesting topic. I was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake Hollywood crap. Also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending, or some sort of redeeming quality, like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasn't genuinely being considered great (IMDB rating 9.0?!, maybe that's a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in Hollywood is laughing at us.)

Unfortunately the minimum rating is 1/10 whereas I believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate. In ancient Rome they had no concept of negative numbers, I feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0. 

Don't see this film please, and for goodness sake don't let it win any Oscars, I don't want the industry to be polluted with films like this.

It's true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without.

This is more than a coming of age story; the title "Family" or "Motherhood" would be just as appropriate. Set in Texas, the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of Linklater's other work: a film that begins with dialog unlike any other Linklater films evolves into thoughtful, poignant discourse not unlike that from the "Before" series. One character in a late-night nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady "Waking Life." With that said, this absolutely is not a mere think piece. What makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is, given its scope. Without giving any narrative away, I'll say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises. I watched many films at Sundance 2014 (including comedies), and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout: we laughed, gasped, covered our eyes, and I am sure more than a few of us wept.

The characters are well developed. Don't be fooled by the title --- the spirit of Boyhood is alive here, but the female characters are thoroughly developed, distinct, and alive. Unfortunately, though it's 2014, this is a rarity in cinema.

Like in "Waking Life" and "A Scanner Darkly", Linklater has again delivered true visual innovation. This time, however, his set-up is simple: shooting on film, Linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse. Has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? Linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly. Despite this, the effect is riveting.

I am not exaggerating when I say that after I watched this film I sold all of my other tickets to Sundance films. Viewing Boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that I didn't want to tarnish the experience by any comparison. Everyone in the Eccles theater shared a special few hours together. Though this only premiered a few days ago, I am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our time.

I always look for the gem amongst the summer blockbusters that makes you think. After all the critical hype I was salivating at the prospect of seeing this film. What a crashing disappointment !!

Take away the gimmick of filming it over 12 years and you have a film that frequently references "American Pie". So many cliché characters - single mom coping with bad mating choices and struggling to bring up two lively children;the characters of the said lively children; the hippy dad who turns into the antithesis of everything he talks about at the start of the movie; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the educational establishment; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the prison service;a grandparent couple who give bibles and shotguns as "coming of age" birthday presents; geeky teenager who scores with not one but two stunning girlfriends - the list goes on. At the end of the movie the thought that hit me was "Is that it?". I had hoped that Linklater might be another chronicler of current America as it still is a puzzle for us in the rest of the world but in this film there is nothing new being said. For that there is still only John Sayles.

Once a year, over the last 12 years, Richard Linklater ('Waking Life' / 'Before Sunset') has reunited the same cast and shot segments of a feature film following the life of a boy (played by Ellar Coltrane  who literally grew into this part and became an actor of substance) from the age of 5 through the age of 18; the result is both fascinating and inspired. The only other project that comes close in comparison is Michael Apted's 'Seven Up' series which documents the lives of a collection of school children in 7-year intervals, starting in 1964 and still going as of the latest edition in 2012. What's so unique about 'Boyhood' is that these individuals (including Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and Linklater's own daughter, Lorelei Linklater) evolve and age within a scripted narrative that is not 'like' a time capsule, this is a completely authentic period piece that retraces an era from the cultural response to September 11th, through the election of Barrack Obama, and into the age of social media saturation. As you watch these actors morph through more than a decade of their lives within a few hours, the story becomes as engaging as its concept. Throughout my life and travels, I've heard so little enthusiasm for Linklater outside of Austin and it's a shame because he is a unique force within the industry and quite an American gem. The director received a well-deserved standing ovation from SXSW's elated audience having, once again, set a new standard in the exploration of film's potential and reinforcing the limitlessness of DIY filmmaking.

There is something people should know before watching this movie, and that is that it takes place from 2002 to 2014. I grew up in that same generation, so as I watched this movie I felt like I was growing up all over again seeing the references to pop culture, society, politics, middle school, high school, and technology. It was incredible to experience that. And even for those who weren't children growing up in those 12 years will still feel a sense of going back in time. There was not one moment that I thought wasn't needed. In fact, I and the rest of the audience wished there had been more going on. 

The plot is very simple: what does it mean to grow up, become an adult, and live? And as the years go by, it becomes apparent that Mason (the main character) is struggling to find his place in life. Though there are a few struggles he encounters and some thematic material, overall the movie is hilarious and real. From Richard Linklater's previous films, I've noticed that the dialogue all feels real (to a point where I feel like I'm interacting with the characters). And it is so well done in this film. 

Speaking of Linklater, I see an Oscar nomination for directing coming his way. As he sat down for Q&A on Boyhood, one of the things he said that struck the audience was that he thought it was funny that people who saw "Boyhood" told him he improved as a director. This was funny to him because one of the first rules he made before filming in 2002 was that he could not change as a director for the sake of the movie to have no continuity errors (especially so the tone didn't change). The only improvement going on is the superb acting from Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, and (of course) Ellar Coltrane. 

With probably the best ending I've ever seen for a movie and a story guided by a talented director, "Boyhood" is the most powerful and unique coming-of-age film ever made and it will be proclaimed as a classic for the years to come.

Every once in a while, you can witness something that hits you at your very core. I've felt this very few times in my film loving career. I gazed in awe at the sight of dinosaurs in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, marveled witnessing the birth of the universe in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, and now, I sit in sheer admiration and respect at the magic that is Richard Linklater's Boyhood. Nothing you have read, heard, or seen about the film will prepare you for the experience that is this cinematic rarity. Filmed over twelve years, Boyhood tells the story of Mason, who we follow from ages 5 to 18. 

Starring Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Lorelei Linklater, Boyhood assembles the finest cast of 2014 so far. Each player, dedicating themselves to the greater cause, allows themselves to evolve. Fully realized, and oozed with every rich element of movie making, Linklater writes the most authentic characters to grace the screens in years. Ready for more hyperbolic thoughts? Doesn't make it less true but get ready. Boyhood, potentially, could be one of the best films ever made. Last year, I referred to his third installment of the Before series, "a masterpiece." I stand by that even today. Boyhood however, is something that is a once in a lifetime endeavor that will be studied, criticized, admired, and bring all the discussions about film to the forefront. I feel blessed just to have watched it.

Ellar Coltrane is simply stupendous. As you watch his transformation before your eyes, his subtle and restrained performance will floor you, scene after scene, year after year. It's astounding how Coltrane interprets young Mason as a boy, bringing him through adolescence with grace, and then fully realizes what kind of man he has become. There's an intimacy in which Coltrane decides to finesse Mason upon the audience. He thoroughly cares about him, understanding his confusions, and even more, realizing his flaws. It's one of the year's most outstanding performances and one of the best delivered by any child actor.

Ethan Hawke continues to be one of the more undervalued and underutilized actors working today. Though he has three Oscar nominations to his name, two for co-writing Before Sunset and Before Midnight, and one for Best Supporting Actor in Antoine Fuqua's Training Day, I'm still unsure about how Hollywood and the world perceives his abilities. As Mason's Dad, Hawke takes his character to the brink of sheer brilliance. Showcasing an unrestrained and eager willingness to connect with his children, Dad, as he's only called in the film, is a sensational and intriguing look into fatherhood and being human. Chasing the dreams, and believing you are destined for something greater, Dad allows the audience to relish in his quest to be connected and complacent. Hawke shines once again, involving both mind and spirit, into a man we may know all too well.

As Mom, Patricia Arquette ignites the spirit in a performance that should land her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Headlining a career that has produced impressive work on TV's "Medium," as well as in films like True Romance, Arquette's prowess is her ability to be a fallen character without requiring pity or persuasion from the viewer. She interprets a woman, desperate for a connection to other aspects of her life, and reinvents the foundation of the broken mother. Arquette's beautiful yet exhilarating turn often feels like riding on the edge of a cliff, unsure if we're going in, but even more excited just to be on the ride with her. Pure and raw talent exists in her, and it's been worth the wait to finally witness it all unravel.

Richard Linklater casts his daughter Lorelei Linklater to play Samantha, Mason's older sister. Without even realizing or thinking about it, you secretly and solemnly fall in love with her transformation from girl to woman. She is every bit as brilliant as any person in the cast, delivering on all beats, allowing her awkward yet sweet demeanor to pierce through yet not forgetting her annoyance and overbearing nature in which she came. Honestly, it's a performance destined to be forgotten during the awards year but it's something I will recall for years to come.

There are other supporting players that we meet throughout the journey particularly Marco Perella and Zoe Graham, who completely make their mark during the picture.

Running at 165 minutes, this dramatic, coming-of-age epic had me just yearning for more. I wanted to stay with them, see their journeys continue, and just relish in this dream a bit longer. I walked out secretly (or not so secretly) wishing that Linklater is quietly filming these same characters for the next twelve years, and will not reveal the plans until it's all finished. Talk about the surprise of my life. At 42 years old when and if that happens, I will be excited for the ride. 

Shot gorgeously by Lee Daniel and Shane F. Kelly, and edited with clarity and love by Sandra Adair, Boyhood succeeds as a technical marvel just as much as a narrative and performance piece. Linklater's writing, on virtually every level, is the best thing since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Originality, and taking a fresh perspective on a genre that could feel stale for some, Linklater will make you a believer again. His direction is even more impressive. It's the single best thing that he's ever done and probably ever will do. It's the pinnacle of his career, and is his offering to cinema for all-time.

In essence, Linklater's Boyhood is a must-see film for any lover of the movies. It's the type of film that was imagined when they invented film. With tears in my eyes, I marveled and wept for a creation I still may not fully understand but am anxiously waiting to revisit very soon.

Don't fool yourself, it's just bad. Don't watch it. You may thank me for this advice. I wanted to keep this comment short, because I don't want to spend more time of my life for this movie, almost three hours was enough. On the other side, the movie made me feel better about myself in some way. I mean some people spent 12 years making this (what a waste). This was refreshing, because they lost more of their life than me. This long production time doesn't show itself in the quality. I had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality. They used the style of bad propaganda movies, typical suburban shots where you expect, that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children. Of course it would be explained too why it is bad, like everything else in this movie, they put the words in your mouth, leaving NOTHING for the imagination. I don't even mention that the main "character" is not special at all, even more boring than an average person. Oh, and he makes bad quality photos too (in this bad quality movie), living the life of an artist in a movie, which never heard of art (and he leaves his picture in the developer for "waaay" to long, listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead). You will find all kinds of schemes and clichés in this "piece of modern film history" (as they call it.), in this movie, which doesn't dare to state anything (The whole movie was like a 3 hours long "idk"). Showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming white-trash, is pro-marijuana (I guess), but only daring to show it for a split of a second. I watched every second of this movie, just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? With a highly unrealistic chick (acting like a date-raper) sitting with our high (placebo-mescaline) main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film: I don't know.

Worst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and I was still waiting for something to happen. I would of had a more productive time watching grass grow. Don't waste your time watching this film. I don't see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve. It went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it. The most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15. It was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody. He was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didn't go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didn't achieve much- it was a pointless film. It was like the film was made to actually be as bad, boring and ordinary as possible- not one part of the film was embellished or interesting. To sum it up, an awful film.

By some miracle, the run time of this movie has proved to be the exact same length as that of the forth installment of the Transformers franchise. Having slogged through nearly three hours of robots hitting robots shot from a camera permanently fixed between the thighs of our lead female protagonist a week earlier, Richard Linklater's latest contribution to modern cinema was a more than welcome reminder that visionary filmmakers still exist, and that the actual run time compared to how long the run time feels speaks much of film quality. 

Boyhood documents the early life of a boy called Mason, beginning at six, then continuing all the way through middle-school, high school and eventually his move to college at eighteen years of age. Although the story line is fairly simplistic and one might argue, unadventurous, the sheer ambition of the director is reason enough to hand your money over; shot over twelve years with the same group of actors, audiences can experience the true evolution of a character like never before.

However as Linklater said himself, if the audience see this merely as an experiment, then he has failed at his task. The movie has its own story to tell. The aforementioned criticism of an overly simplistic plot is what makes the story so identifiable not just for young people, but for adults as well; the film could easily be called 'adulthood' or 'parenthood' or even take a more generalised title of 'Life' - Linklater understands people, and is therefore one of the few modern filmmakers who understands the importance of well-rounded, interesting and relatable characters to tell a story.

When watching Boyhood, you don't think of the ramifications, the possible pitfalls and how difficult it must have been to make. You instead choose to enjoy it at surface level, only truly appreciating the sheer brilliance of what has been achieved after the film. This really is a once-in-a-lifetime film and therefore a once-in-a-lifetime experience for anyone watching it. Soon to be a modern classic, this is a picture that will be looked back on as one of the greatest ever made.

The tracking of these characters over a 12 year period is interesting and impressive, but the movie has gaping plot holes and character development that is either unexplained or unbelievable. Some of the characters are just caricatures kind of thrown up on the wall with no support or explanation. The actors who play the two leads, Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater, are one-dimensional actors in this movie and play very morose, seemingly depressed youth who drag themselves through life - they certainly don't demonstrate any joy for living. You can understand why Mason's high school girlfriend breaks up with him. Mom's two husbands go haywire with no development or warning, and this is especially jarring in the transformation of the second husband, who goes from being a very cool guy who is an understanding stepfather and husband to being someone's idea of a vet who goes bad. And how could Dad go from being a flaming liberal to finding happiness with the stereotyped bible-thumping, gun-toting Republican Texas family? In the end, the continuity of the actors is the thing, but the acting and plot development disappoints and leaves one feeling empty at the end.

Rented this movie over the weekend after Oscar nominations and reading reviews, etc. I think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that Linklater made a project of filming his daughter/actress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic. I can't understand how an actual documentary like Hoop Dreams gets snubbed, not too mention Selma's director getting snubbed, but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy. The novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds, you watch them 'physically grow' that's it, that's the big wow factor of the film. I'd of preferred to watch grass grow actually! The acting and scenes seem forced and I couldn't figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? A documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining. Mason, the son's character, never really evolves, the cliché single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men, has been done before- keep in mind this is NOT a documentary, this is a movie/story- I couldn't help but think to myself while watching this film that I know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous. I mean, Mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh. Mason's first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? A commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? Clearly I'm in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film. I don't see the originality, excellence in acting, directing, etc. outside of using the same actors for 12 years- one of which, is the directors daughter.

I'll start:

1. 12 years of wasted time; 2. Literally nothing happens for 3 hours; 3. Scumbag stepfathers everywhere; 4. The transition from cute kid to an emo kid; 5. I only write this, cuz IMDb requires 10 lines of text; 6. 12 years of indie rock bands; 7. Not sure if gay; 8. Most epic twist in movie history lol jk; 9. Can't believe it's nominated for an Oscar; 10. Best movie to sleep on; 11. How to throw away $4,000,000; 12. The boring life of a regular kid; 13. Unfortunately it didn't get more HD each 20 minutes; 14. Desperate housewife; 15. Much feels wow; 16. This is why you shouldn't trust IMDb ratings; 17. Shot in 12 years, lasts 12 years also.

They spent 12 years filming but no actual thought on the plot or ending. Afters 2 hours I finally realized this movie was never gonna get to a point or climax. And it ended with nothing. If you want to watch just to see the actors age and their acting improve then yes watch. But don't watch if you need a story, your not gonna get one here. It was basically a movie about a family, no happy ending no lessens learned, just life how it goes, super boring and slow. I think the producers could have given it an ending or a meaning of something or the kid learn a lesson or anything. But that didn't happen, it just ended.

Boyhood begins with a flourish - two extra sweet kids with big personalities in a typical American household of the 21st century (ish!). We are introduced to Mason and his sister and everything about them is cute, open and what you would expect from children of their age but with something special too. There is promise in this film - funny family episodes, great acting from Arquette and Hawke plus cameos from a variety of interesting people. We see the kids get older and various traumas occur from the Mother's poor choices in men and parenting - as Mason reaches about 15 years old, the film suddenly gets very stale and very boring. He is no longer cute - but that does not matter if only the director could have got something out of him that was not a monotone of dialogue that has been imbued with the dull monotony of the brain dumb video game generation - something really happens to those kids - they become robotic and that goes for his sister too. Feel very sad to see it - all the personality goes out of these kids from too much computer deadening. That would not matter so much if only Linklater could have followed up perhaps even a 10th of the story lines - so many people left to wander away and no one knows anything about them and the effect on the kids. I mean the mother has a life changing relationship with an alcoholic university professor with two kids that are obviously bonded with Mason and his sister - they spend some years living together - the impact of this split is left high and dry. The film goes on for about 1 hour and 40 mins too long and the aspects of Mason's story that are brought out from the director in these long winded and terribly slow agonising (can't wait to leave the cinema) minutes are very boring. Sadly I left the movie not caring two hoots about Mason and that seemed a waste to me.

Like many of Richard Linklater's films, Boyhood will will continue to inspire controversy and enjoy notoriety for many years to come. All serious film-goers will see it and discuss it. Many will love it. Some will not.

As a member of Richard Linklater's Austin Film Society I was predisposed to like this film a lot. The uniformly rave reviews from festivals and major media film critics set my expectations at the highest level.

I loved the director's earlier, pioneering masterstroke of experimental technique, Waking Life, and his uncanny ability to bring complex, fascinating characters to life on the screen, as in Bernie. I'm not a big fan of his slacker films, but Boyhood bore the promise of what I saw as the best of Linklater's filmography: applying an unprecedented and challenging creative methodology to a story about the evolution of characters over time. Wow!

My wife warned me that I was setting myself up for disappointment. She was right. The film turned out to be a lengthy, disappointing, mockumentary about the evolution of a slacker. 

The production values were uniformly good, earning an A for effort, but the narrative line meandered aimlessly as moderately interesting characters aged, a C at best. Overall, a B minus. (7/10 stars)

Over the course of 12 years Mason, a thoughtful, energetic, and charming little boy turns into a passive, whining cipher who walks like a zombie. His mother serenely makes innumerable bad life choices but unexpectedly implodes as her youngest leaves for college, while his estranged father evolves from slacker to relatively responsible adult - about 10 years too late to have any redeeming value to his son. Linklater's daughter, Lorelei plays Samantha, an almost unremittingly insensitive and obnoxious child, even as a twenty year old. 

The principal adult actors, Arquette and Hawke, as well as the supporting cast of step-parents, friends and relatives did a highly professional job, portraying complex, multi-dimensional characters who grew and changed over the course of the film. Sadly, the ostensible focal point of the exercise, the boy, devolved into another irresponsible slacker. 

According to a local interview with the director, Lorelei asked early on if her character might be allowed to die, ending her participation in the creative endeavor. Perhaps she anticipated the lack of universal acclaim for her father's most recent effort - a noble experiment, but to some, a disappointing result.

I don't have a huge amount to say about this film as I feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours.

For those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film I have a question. Would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadn't watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? Would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? My personal answer is no. And my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters.

I'm not denying the concept is brilliant and original. However, overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of puberty.

So, I rented BOYHOOD from Netflix, but they sent me this two hour forty five minute collection of outtakes. It seems there is no way to see the actual film, just these endless scenes that were deleted because they were so boring.

Apparently I have to have ten lines of text to post a review on IMDb. 

So, I'll recount some of the worst scenes. The scenes with Ethan Hawke singing singing  an unforgivable sin. The soundtrack songs (all of them, total crap). The Bible and Shotgun and Beatles album he gets for his fifteenth birthday. The scene where he's with a bunch of Jr and Sr High boys alone being dicks in an unfinished construction site. The scene where his drunk step-father is in the frame (all of them) His mother (every single second). The pointless scenes where he just whines and complains that life is pointless ( No, wait; the SCRIPT is pointless). Are we supposed to accept that he is a completely passive observer to his whole life, and gets into photography (ooooo a metaphor!) as a reflection of his mere observation of reality? Sorry, way too little, way too late. 

The gimmick filming the same cast as they age twelve yearsis nice. Too bad there wasn't a PLOT, Story, Action, or any point.

Total crap. Huge waste of time unless you're chief delight is The GOP and shooting guns and being a lower-middle class loser oxygen thief stuck in Nowhere, Texas. 

AVOID THIS GARBAGE.

Because of all the positive hype, I hoped for at least a good film. I'm left wondering what it is I just don't get. So many good reviews? Even Mark Kermode says the young actor in the film has 'screen presence' and I think WTF! He's playing a boring so and so - he's not supposed to have presence.

I'm not sure if there's enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes - seriously. Certain things like Ethan Hawk showing an empty wallet caught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through nearly 3 hours of this. I just don't understand how it won the golden globe for best film. Thankfully, there's a few negative reviews from like-minded people for me to know I've not gone completely mad!
