### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a film that shouldn't be as uncommon as it is for American cinema. It's a seriously contemplative and revealing drama about a young woman lost and confused about her sexual identity upon committing one of society's most serious taboos and realizing that she liked it and might want to try it again. And again. And enough times to keep an audio diary of her thoughts and experiences about said act.

I'll catch you up; set in 1970's San Francisco, Minnie (Bel Powley), a fifteen-year-old girl and aspiring cartoonist, experiences her sexual awakening after losing her virginity to her mother's sorta-boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård). Minnie considers herself overweight and undesirable in every sense, and is largely neglected by her Bohemian mother Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), who is usually too busy smoking weed or doing drugs with strangers to even notice her daughter, so this awakening comes as an immense shock to Minnie and her person.

Minnie begins to crave more sex and attention from Monroe, going as far as to make intimate sex with him a regular thing, in addition to craving sex from strangers and other boys her age, all under her mother's nose. This sex drive, however, is deeper than horniness, but a cry by Minnie for companionship, desire, and, most of all, love. Minnie wants to be the apple of someone's eye, so much so that when she leaves, the person feels like they'll die without her company and security.

I've long had the same hunger Minnie has had, though I've been fortunate, as a male, to see roughly two or three coming of age films that accurately reflect my emotions, my desires, and my sexual awakening. Young girls and stories of their sexual awakening have been cruelly shortchanged in American film and "The Diary of a Teenage Girl" takes note of that just by existing. Consider scenes when Monroe and Minnie have sex, makeout with one another, or Minnie describes past sexual advances to her best friend. If these scenes made you at all uncomfortable, uneasy, or awkward (like they did me), then writer and directress Marielle Heller has effectively proved that fact without even saying it. Now switch the genders of the two main characters, think about the situation over again, and see if you feel that same level of discomfort.

Heller unapologetically details Minnie's desires in a way that, while revealing, is whimsical, thanks to the presence of Minnie's drawings springing to life before her eyes. However, this occasional distraction is offset by Heller's honest depiction of Minnie and, most importantly, the rawer scenes of the film, like when we see Minnie stand naked before a mirror as she examines her body and voices her desire to be loved and cherished. It's something I'm sure most young girls have done at least a few times in their life; standing before a mirror entirely exposed and hoping someone will love you for all of you rather than just parts of you. It's the basic level of human feeling, and Minnie has discovered it and craves it much quicker than any of her friends have.

Bel Powley is a force on-screen here, positioning herself not as a fabled caricature but an empowering everygirl that transcends beyond the confines of a typical teenage girl into somebody many can relate to. It also helps that Powley, herself, is such a great screen presence, confident even when her character is insecure, and encapsulated in a bubble that teeters between innocence and the loss of innocence.

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" could easily be paired with "Turn Me On, Goddammit!," a Norwegian coming of age drama about a girl relatively the same age as Minnie, who becomes entranced with masturbation and sexual pleasure so much so that it takes over her life. Truly impacting and significant coming of age stories for young girls are depressingly few and far between and here is a film that boldly asserts itself by silently calling audiences out on its double standards for young women, focusing on a relatable protagonist throughout the film, giving us artful direction and attractive aesthetics not as a means to sugarcoat but to humanize, and concluding the picture with an ending that, while unfortunately fairly radical for American cinema, hits as hard as some of the best endings of films this year.

I saw the movie that at the New Directors/New Films film festival in New York in March 2015. I read Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel that the film was based on. Although I did enjoy the book, I did struggle with the characters and a lot of the things the characters were doing, but I couldn't wait to read it every night. I loved the way she told the story of a 15-year-old girl that has just started an affair with her mother's boyfriend in 1970's San Francisco.

I was drawn to read the book and see the movie because I am a huge Alexander Skarsgård fan and I love to support his films. His character, Monroe Rutherford, seemed like a total jerk in the book. Alex's take on the character was much sweeter. Sure, the content is the same, but the characters in the movie (ALL of the characters) seemed much more likable in the movie. It was hard to see why Minnie would be so into Monroe in the book, but it is quite evident in the movie. Besides Alex's handsome good looks, his Monroe is a happy-go-lucky guy that shows he has a heart. (Very caring) Not that I think that having an affair with your girlfriend's 15-year-old daughter is a good thing or appropriate, you can see how a situation like this could happen (especially in that household). The fact that he could take a character like Monroe and make him so likable, convinces me that this is his best performance to date.

Minnie is the kind of girl that loves to be touched and show affection. She is a highly talented girl that has so much going on around her, and she is receptive to take it all in. I'm happy to see the way that the director/screenplay writer Marielle Heller told her story. I had heard some people said there were cringe-worthy scenes, but I didn't feel that way.

Sure there are plenty of sex and drug scenes in the movie but they are done fairly quickly and with respect and are essential to the story. There is humor throughout and lots of animation in the style of Phoebe Gloeckner and Aline Kominsky.

As I said earlier, I didn't care for the characters in the book as much as I did in the film. Bel Powley is SUPERB as Minnie (you never do detect her natural British accent). Kristen Wiig still plays an awful mother, but you can tell she cares, but in her own way. Christopher Meloni was a caring and humorous ex-step-father. I also enjoyed Madeleine Waters as Kimmie and Margarita Levieva as Tabatha which were two of the characters I particularly didn't like in the book.

Marielle's take on the book was superb. This was a passion project for her and it shows. I hope to see more of her work in the future. 

Brandon Trost won the Cinematography award at Sundance and you will see why. It just doesn't feel like any other movie I have seen. It is such a stand-out film.

THE DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL was an excellent movie and I cannot wait to see it again and again. I hope it has a soundtrack because I definitely want to buy it. It may not be suitable to see with the family, but definitely grab your best friend and go!

Love this film. I highly recommend it. Written/filmed/acted beautifully. Very human. Very funny.

If you're prude or judgmental, go see this film, but be warned.

Movie-goers complain that Hollywood films are all the same. But then movie-goers complain when an original film like The Diary Of A Teenage Girl comes out. Funny that.

Yes, the subject matter is dark, but the filmmakers have struck the pitch-perfect tone. There is nothing cynical about this film.

This true story is told from the point-of-view of Minnie, a lonely 15-year-old girl who loves to draw, and who loves to have a bunch of consensual sex with her mother's pathetic 35-year-old boyfriend Monroe.

The animated parts are sweet, funny, raunchy--the drawings a 15-year-old girl.

I disagree with the UK reviewer who says she speaks in the "wise beyond her years" dialogue typical of American teenage films. I had the exact opposite reaction: I was relieved to hear her speak in plain, simple, sometimes downright dumb sentences. (So ignore the numpty Brit reviewer.)

Many will find it impossible to separate the (illegal) deed from the brilliant story. So I'll address this review to people who are on the fence: 

If you think you'd like to see this film, go see it. 

Don't be scared away. Yes, the material is a little uncomfortable at first, but take a couple of breaths, and remember that this is a true story. Enjoy the honesty. Enjoy the non-judgment. Enjoy some empathy. There's so much cynicism on TV and on the internet. You deserve a break. Go see this movie and show yourself some cinema love.

An honest, unfiltered & nonjudgmental coming of age drama about a young woman's sexual endeavours, The Diary of a Teenage Girl is a nicely crafted, sensibly narrated & wonderfully performed cinema that's highly bohemian in nature, emanates a psychedelic vibe from start to finish & is further uplifted by its well-put together cast.

Based on the graphic novel of the same name, the story of The Diary of a Teenager is set in San Francisco during the 1970s and concerns Minnie, a 15-year old aspiring cartoonist who in the wake of her sexuality begins a relationship with her mother's boyfriend. However, her longing for love & acceptance soon sets her on a path to much bolder adventures.

Written & directed by Marielle Heller in what is her filmmaking debut, The Diary of a Teenage Girl is oddly stylish, surreal & provocative in depicting the sexual & artistic awakening of its protagonist and captures the highs & lows of adolescent life with utmost sincerity. Heller's direction is as good as her screenplay, and it's refreshing to see the story being told from a girl's perspective.

Production design team does a good job in replicating the 1970s setting, Cinematography makes splendid use of its camera & bright colour tones to further enhance its images, and Editing is finely carried out while the music fits its scene. Coming to the performances, Bel Powley delivers a terrific performance and is brilliantly supported by Alexander Skarsgård, Kristen Wiig & others.

On an overall scale, The Diary of a Teenage Girl is a bold example of its genre that attempts to capture the turmoil of teenage years without sugarcoating any of it, is capable of leaving a few viewers squirming on their seats with its explicit nature, and thanks to its playful tone & sensible handling of its characters, is a welcome entry in the coming-of-age filmmaking landscape. Definitely worth a shot.

Being a grumpy old guy, I'm not at all the target audience for this film, so please bear that in mind when I tell you that I found this a fairly tedious coming-of-age movie. I admired aspects of it - in particular the performances of Bel Powley and Alexander Skarsgård - but I wasn't able to maintain my interest in the story.

The biggest obstacle was, I think, that Minnie, the eponymous teenage girl, was not the only adolescent around. All the adults in her life were at various stages of arrested development. This is possibly the point both of the movie and of the novel it is based on: how can a child grow up when all her role-models are children themselves? It's an interesting question, but when transmitted as drama the audience finds itself stuck in high school for the duration.

Been hopelessly hooked, for the past several days now, to the captivating selection of 1970s pop that forms the music soundtrack of The Diary of a Teenage Girl. 

The film itself, about a teenage girl discovering and embracing sex amidst the Bohemian surroundings of 1970s San Francisco, impressed me for its rare honesty, its vibrancy, and the wonderful music soundtrack that accompanies the film's moods. Phoebe Gloeckner's searing and much acclaimed 2002 graphic novel comes to screen with a careful selection of eclectic tracks from the 1960s-70s that make the film soar at times. The film is not for the prudish and easily shocked though. And that includes the nannies at the Academy who have completely shut out this indie from this years Oscar nominations!

The Diary of a Teenage Girl is a Robert Crumb comic come to life. You better believe that I loved this film. 2015 has given us a lot of films to talk about, but this one went completely under the radar, and it shouldn't have. This may be the best film of the year, and by far, one of the most provocative and fearless pieces in more than a year.

It's a coming-of-age story about a 15 year-old girl in the 1970's, dangerously experimenting nymphomania with her mother's 35-year old boyfriend. If that sound's frightening, it should be, but that's the point. If films of the time period like "Harold and Maude", "Taxi Driver" and "Fritz the Cat" come to mind, you're right on the money. The early 70's were a wild, revolutionary time were mainstream movies pushed every social boundary it could. This takes us back to those times. Maybe today, the subject matter isn't quite outrageous, but the nuance and celebration of it's outrageousness is infectious to a fresh, new audience. Bel Powley is a breakout star. She's fantastic, and uncannily plays a teenager, when in fact, she's older than me. The other star is Kristen Wiig, in the best role I've ever seen her in, as the hipster mom. She's really a great dramatic actress. Most comedians these days seem to be. The mixture between live-action and animation was lovely to look at, and a solid touch to what would've been a film just as fantastic without it.

This is one of my favorites, and it's going to haunt me for a while now. I love it when movies do that.

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is one film that's not worried about showing it's point even though it's supported by some artistic animation it proves that one young lady is serious about finding herself thru sexual discovery learning that life is about love and lust before you discover your true self. Set in mid 1970's San Francisco Bel Powley is Minnie a young teenage girl who starts an affair with her Mom Charlotte's(Kristen Wiig) boyfriend Monroe(Alexander Skarsgard). And the passion and intimate feel is hot and feel good as many scenes are provocative and blunt showing plenty of skin and breast of young Minnie. As this young lady is in a crazy home life world as mom Charlotte is a fired alcoholic lady who snorts drugs with Monroe on the west coast and California party scene. Thru it all this young lady Minnie learns about people, life and love yet most important she comes to peace thru herself with love and inspiration for art and people. Overall good film of fun, discovery and finding about one's self with a happy feel in the end.

You don't have to be or remember being or know or parent a teenage girl to find yourself addressed by The Diary of a Teenage Girl. Its broader theme is the danger of power, especially the sexual license which the setting  San Francisco, 1976  emblematizes. 

Young Minnie discovers both her sexual and her creative power as she's deflowered by her mother's boyfriend Monroe and draws cartoons in the style of (R Crumb's wife) Aline Kominsky. (Monroe, by the way, may be a studly ballooning of Jules Feiffer's nebbish hero of the time, as Minnie proves a long way away from the cartoon style of Mickey and his gal.) The animation scenes show her living in a state of heightened awareness, life bursting out and into art. Both endeavours prove dangerous. Her affair threatens her mother's shaky security and her art-work can strike the conventional (e.g., Monroe) as freaky as her exuberant sex strikes a younger lover. Her other creative enterprise, tape recording her confessions, blows up the scene. Art and sex are avenues of self-discovery and self-realization  dangerous. Both are life-affirming but both herald the frightening responsibilities of adulthood.

Minnie is obviously the film's central subject and consciousness. Self-conscious about her physical imperfections, she succumbs to her mother's and Monroe's invitations to assert her sexuality. Full credit to Bel Powley for an astonishing, shameless and vanity-free presentation.

But the other women are significant too. There's Minnie's "white trash  but in a good way" best friend, in whom she entrusts teen confidences but who steals a bout with Monroe herself. 

There's the lesbian lurking in the bush who seduces Minnie only to exploit her for her own purposes. So you don't have to be a man to exploit a trusting young girl  though Monroe demonstrates how swaggering manhood and convenient access are a huge advantage. Monroe's casual predation shows how his power can destroy him too. He knows he shouldn't do what he does and he knows Minnie is manipulating him but he can't control himself. He even drifts into Charlotte's silly web to resolve the issue: Monroe must marry Minnie. He's too easily satisfied even to realize his own small dream of a mail-order vitamin empire. Remote infusions define him. The fact that he lets himself be seduced by young Minnie shows him victim of his own passivity, a character wholly without character.

But the two other key characters are Minnie's mother and younger sister. Charlotte was a highschool beauty, is still as beautiful and enchanting as Kristen Wiig, surrounded by lusting lovers  and is paralyzed by that former power. She desperately clings to romance because she feels she has lost her sexual appeal and beauty. As her egotistical ex-husband Pascal insensitively declares, she can't run her own life. We watch her drift from one stupor to the next, abandoning Minnie to Monroe and latenite TV, eventually being fired from her library job. Only the fear that her anger may have driven Minnie to suicide sobers her up sufficiently to embrace her prodigal daughter. At the end, though, Charlotte is still "seeing" Monroe, unable to escape her enslavement to her sexual liberty with him. "We can never talk about it," she instructs Minnie, but she can't leave the man who humiliated her either.

Kid sister Gretel shows more hope. Without either her beautiful mother's or her plainer sister's looks she has to find another path to mature self-respect. With her mother's shallowness as one model, she finds a preferable one in the new Minnie. From her she learns that she doesn't need a man or a relationship for self-respect. The two sisters used to fight and swap bitter notes but at the end they frolic together, with an exuberance that bonds them as women, as sisters.

Well, the first thing is this film is not for everyone. Because the contents were too strong for being a teen theme. That means it is good for the grown ups to watch. The story of a 15 year old girl in the 70s living with her mother and small sister. It begins when her sexual urges takes off, her first with a middle aged man. So she documents everything and besides, with her close friend's support, they together explore even more options. Being a minor and yet her real life to commence, what she plans for the future determines the remaining developments.

The performance by Bel Powley was amazing. She was the perfect choice to play that role despite she's older than the role. There were many nudes and sex scenes, but was not that strong, especially when compared with the similar themes of the present era films. The pace had lots of ups and downs, but the progression was on the right path which actually saved the film.

The story was just fine, no complication to understand and also not easy to explain, but in a short, it was a teenage girl's sexual exploration. Everybody gets into that stage of life, but only few courageously opts a path to accomplish. And for some, it is an open opportunity that makes them to get there than intentionally make that move. I felt the film was well adapted from its book and directed by a newcomer, Surely worth a watch, but again I'm saying that it is not for everyone.

It's 1976 San Francisco. Fifteen year old Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley) is overjoyed at losing her virginity to her mother Charlotte (Kristen Wiig)'s boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård). They begin a secret affair. Minnie and her friend Kimmie Minter get into various adult situations. Her stepfather Pascal MacCorkill (Christopher Meloni) wants to stay in her and her sister Gretel's lives. She records tapes of her diary and draws inspired by cartoonist Aline Kominsky.

This takes a less conventional look at the sexual coming-of-age story from the female perspective. It is not flowers and puppies. It is highly sexual in nature. It is unflinching. My main problem is that Bel is a little too old to play the fifteen year old. I rather have a younger actress do the role without the nudity. There is a shock with a man having sex with a young girl that is missing in this movie. She looks 20s. I'm reminded of Heather Matarazzo in 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' and the shock of that sexual subject matter. This movie has the same shocking subject.

Like most teenage girls, Minnie is longing for love, acceptance and a sense of purpose in the world. 

She begins to have an intimate affair with her mother's boyfriend, "the handsomest man in the world," Monroe Rutherford. 

What follows is an account of one girl's sexual and artistic awakening, without judgement.........

The Diary of a Teenage Girl is just that, a girls sexual awakening and coming of age, from her point of view, and no on else's opinion is valid from a narrative point of view, because the narrative is told from her musings into her tape recorder, and her drawings of probably the most feminist caricature I've seen since Crumb picked up his pencil.

And all the while the films story is told, the Patty Hearst trial is quite prominent on newspapers and TV, another female who didn't give in for anybody.

But the wonderful thing about the film coming from the titular characters perspective, is that we can feel all of her emotions as they fight one another in what could be the most emotional time for a girl in her life, especially as her first encounter is with her Mothers Boyfriend, played with wonderful smugness by Skarsgård. We see him through her eyes. Prominent, leading, daring. And then finally, boorish, misleading, and childish, indicating to the viewer that Minnie soon wises up to false idols, thanks partly to her mother and her mothers ways.

Her Mother is played down by Kristen Wiig, at once appearing as a pathetic human being, someone who can only be active by substance, and at once a barrier for her breaking on through to the other side, hence the affair with Monroe.

As the film goes on, it becomes more psychedelic, more hazy, noting the fact that Minnie is now experimenting with narcotics, and veering down the path of solace.

It's pretty heavy going stuff at times, after all, everything to a 15 year old is dramatic, but throughout, there is an air of whimsy, keeping the film from becoming depressing and too deep.

Minnie is not your atypical fifteen year old girl. She is testing the waters, at her age you can fall into any camp, sexually or personality wise, and throughout the film she tests many a water.

All in all its a pretty fascinating look into a the mind and random thoughts of a girl coming of age.

Would make a really odd double bill with Inside Out.

I had no idea what to expect when I started watching this movie. It drew me in right away. 

Its a very real coming of age movie. Real not only because it is based on a true story but also because the characters have different shades to them. They are not one dimensional. The bad guy is also misguided and means well. The girl is not just an innocent victim but also makes some bad choices. And so though I want to express I am not OK with abuse (!) what I am trying to say is there is some gray in this story. This movie very correctly shows us that life is hardly ever black and white.

Its a touching story and its very easy to feel sympathy for this girl. I found myself very engaged and curious about where and how it would end.

My only comment is that some of the script is a bit jumbled to me. Missed flow, I cannot explain it better then that.

Overall very well done so I recommend you give it a go.

Only so often are we treated with a refreshing new look with a different angle of a movie. This time Marielle Heller hands us a hilarious, heartfelt coming-of-age film starring the talented Bel Powley. She uses drawings and creativity in describing what's going on in a young woman's head when she first has sex, and well, an affair, and the feelings that come along with those experiences.

Minnie (Bel Powley) starts the movie with saying she just had sex for the first time and how incredible it was. She has these moments with herself and records them on cassette to get all the feelings and thoughts out, as a form of a diary. She shares with her friends and her mom Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), but keeps a secret. Minnie continues to have sex and doesn't want to stop. Feelings spiral. She decides to have questionable experiences with her friends, and even regrets some. She eventually comes to terms with her relationship and learns, just like everyone does.

Bel Powley is the next rising star in Hollywood. She is an incredible talent and amusing, while sometimes delirious. For a character who's comical, sarcastic and emotional, she nailed it. I really enjoyed this movie, way more than I expected. It reminded me of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" in a lot of ways. It's a very easy watch and a great way to laugh at the humorous writing.

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a wonderful watch and can be enjoyed by people of both genders. If it's somewhat of a true depiction of what a female feels after having sex for the first time, it's an interesting look inside those feelings for a male. It's lovely all the way through, and a perfect date-night movie.

2015 seems to be the year that has spawned a plethora of new movies - certainly far more than in previous years. Unfortunately, not many of them are very good - it really is a case of quantity before quality.

This film isn't the worst movie that was released for the year but it's very close to it. I endured this rubbish for about an hour after which I just couldn't take any more and gave it away. 

This is a really bad film which to my mind, does not have a single redeeming feature. Very poorly cast, dreadful script, terrible direction and awful script.

Another movie that has seemingly gone out of its way to use the word f--- in every single sentence. People simply don't talk in this manner in real life - sure the odd adjective here and there but in every sentence? It seems that the cameras were manned by a bunch of new apprentices on their very first job not helped by the washed out color that is presented to anyone unfortunate enough to be viewing it. 

It absolutely amazes me that anyone can see anything in this. I can only conclude that it's somehow expected that they appreciate this type of nonsense as it's art or some such rubbish. Unfortunately, the more people heap praise on this type of garbage, the more of it we will see.

Save your money and go and see something else.

Review: I wasn't a big fan of this film! I found it quite boring and the storyline didn't go anywhere. The film is basically about Minnie (Bel Powley), who is sleeping with her mother's boyfriend, Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard), and finds it hard to deal with her personal insecurities. As she lost her virginity with Monroe, she starts to explore with sex whilst sneaking around with Monroe behind her mother, Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), back. Apart from that, there isn't much going on that I found that interesting! The acting is quite good and the 70's backdrop, in San Francisco, is done well but I personally didn't find the characters interesting. Minnie gets fed up with pursuing a relationship with Monroe after a while and Monroe feels guilty about sleeping with a teenager, while her mum just seems lost in a world of drugs and alcohol. For people of Minnie's age who are going through there teenage years, I can see the attraction for this movie but I lost interest after the first sexual act between Minnie and Monroe. The relationship between Minnie and her father, Pascal (Christopher Meloni), was quite interesting but the director chose to give most of the screen time to the Minnie, Monroe relationship, with Minnie narrating her feelings throughout the movie. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy it that much but I can see the appeal for other audiences. Disappointing!

Round-Up: England born, Bel Powley, 23, recently starred in A Royal Night Out, as the Queen in her young years, and she starred in a few episodes of Benidorm. She also stars in Equals, alongside Kristen Stewart, Nicholas Hoult and Guy Pearce, so the projects are starting to pick up since her debut in the Whistleblowers, the Bill and M.I. High in 2007. She has a unique style of acting which is intriguing and innocent, and when she starts to get herself together in this film, she shows a powerful side to her character, we're she can take control. Anyway, this is the first major release for director, Marielle Heller, 36, who didn't do a bad job for her first project but it still made a lose at the box office. I'm sure she will gain respect for this movie, from a certain type of audience, because there is a lot of material that many teenagers can relate to but sadly, it just wasn't my cup of tea.   Budget: $2million Worldwide Gross: $1.8million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/drama's starring Bel Powley, Kristen Wiig, Alexander Skarsgard, Miranda Bailey and Christopher Meloni. 3/10

What is a masterwork -- Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel hybrid -- that roundly condemns patriarchal privilege and the exploitation of young women and girls, here turns into a very careful take on a young's girl's exploration of her sexuality that is rote, unenlightening, devoid of any feeling, and ultimately uninteresting.

Certainly, film versions of novels are different beasts, and I suppose one shouldn't expect faithfulness to the original. But this movie loses its way in that it can't really deal with the subject of exploitation and so, being careful not to veer into said exploitation, makes sure that the subject of sex is as non-erotic as possible.

You can't really tell if Minnie has lost her way, or if she is confused, or full of contradictory emotions, or just a mopey teen. She *appears* to be all these things -- but the tonal flatness of the entire enterprise results in a portrait of a young girl you could not care less about.

Bel Powley's wide-eyed and round-faced blandness fails to convey any complex emotions. Sure, she cries and she gets angry...but to what end? Since the film is so flat, the crises and shocks depicted (having sex with Munroe, doing drugs, hooking up with Tabitha, being "bold" about want to "f**k f**k f**k") are about as interesting as having a big mac. Minnie's final thought about Munroe -- "I'm better than you, you son of a bitch" -- is supposed to gather together, for Minnie and for the reader/viewer, what Minnie has learnt, in overcoming the overweening pretentiousness of men like Munroe. But the knowing smile of Minnie in the graphic novel is replaced by Powley looking half-stupid, to no end.

The film replaces the novel's near-catharsis with some pithy bromides about Minnie, supposedly wiser now, saying she doesn't need a man and intimating that you need to love yourself first. Yeah, another 15-year-old wise beyond her years.

The final insult is that Minnie dances in that kooky, indie way, that is so contemporary, like girls dancing to Feist's 2007 "1234." Girls and women didn't dance like that in 1976. (I know; I was there.)

Better luck next time.

Marielle Heller's debut film is not for the faint hearted. An unusually honest and brutal tale of love and coming of age - a story unlike most others in Hollywood. A gritty yet touching portrayal of 1970s San Fransisco with a shocking story like to fit the times. It's a good watch.

"Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a disturbing story of a 15 year old girl who starts an affair with her mother's boyfriend. From reading another review I learned that this film is from a book by the author Phoebe Gloeckner. I don't think I'm going to read the book anytime soon but from how this film is I can tell that it must be a very good book. This film has a great story-line and in it are some disturbed characters. Minnie, played by Bel Powel, is the teenage girl who loses her virginity to her mother's boyfriend. From this event she mistakenly thinks she's grown and that starts a pattern of destructive events in her life. Monroe, who is played by Alexander Stargard, is the sicko who takes advantage of Minnie (Bel Powel). He continues the sick affair behind his girlfriend's back (Charlotte), who is played by Kristen Wiig, who has her own problems she's dealing with. One thing I didn't like about this film was the animated sequences that were incorporated into the film. I think it could have done without that but I guess it was good to display the main characters thoughts in that way. Over all, it's a nice film and I would recommend it.

To begin, I don't much like movies that show someone under the age of legal consent having sex with a much older partner, HOWEVER...I acknowledge that it happens, and that many times, the age of legal consent is just a number, as there are 12 year olds that have the maturity of a 20 year old, and vice versa.

The first misconception that I would like to clear up is that somehow Monroe acted in a predatory way, forcing himself on Minnie. His behavior, albeit somewhat creepy, was not predatory. Au contraire, Minnie was a willing and complicit partner and certainly seemed to have the mental capacity to make the decision. In fact, while Minnie's 15- year old hormones raged wildly out of control, Monroe often seemed the reluctant lover who felt overwhelmed by her overwhelming "need". Of course, as Minnie discovers, her "need" is not for sex; it is for intimacy. And Monroe cannot provide her with that--perhaps because he is at a different age and level, but more likely because he himself is emotionally immature.

The poor girl! She is surrounded by emotionally immature adults. Her relationship with her mother is colored by her mother's relationships with many different men. Minnie is constantly adjusting her life to her mother's needs, as opposed to the mother meeting the needs of the child. One of the most touching scenes is when Minnie and her mother are in the kitchen eating lunch--and her mother tells her how in love she was with Minnie's father. The audience sees Minnie glow as her mother tells her this-- finally! Minnie realizes that there was a real emotional connection between her mother and father--and it is comforting to her. Maybe her father wasn't like all the other men (and people) that float ephemerally through her mother's bohemian life.

This movie takes us through Minnie's journey of self-realization that sex and intimacy are two very different things--perhaps a journey that all teenagers take at some point.

The movie fails when the mother discovers the affair between Monroe and Minnie. Yes, she would be angry--at her daughter, and at Monroe. But would she get drunk with Monroe, and then summon her daughter to the bar to tell her that Monroe must marry Minnie? Even making the excuse that she and Monroe are drunk, it seems a bit more hare-brained than she is typically depicted in the movie. Also, why wouldn't she immediately tell Monroe that it is statutory rape, and at least threaten him with going to the authorities? It's doubtful that she would follow through, but at least threaten him. After all, she is not such a terrible mom that her children have been taken away from her. Also, the ending where Minnie bumps into Monroe at the beach while she is selling her artwork with her sister...it is a bit contrived. It is an ending that lets us know that Minnie has moved forward emotionally, while Monroe is stagnating. And miraculously, the acceptance back into the family by her mother and sister after her runaway attempt has given her the confidence to sell her artwork at the beach. News flash--she was accepted by her mother and sister prior to the runaway attempt, and she has always been a talented artist! But the writer and/or director wanted to put a neat little bow on it for the end. I give it a 6/10 for being thought provoking, for great acting, for an authentic evocation of the '70s, and an awesome soundtrack (yeah, Iggy Pop and the Stooges!). Downgraded for the pat ending, and the unevenly written character of the mother, who mainly comes off as a stereotype of a single, '70s mom who has a man addiction.

Set in San Francisco in the mid-1970s, first-time director Marielle Heller's The Diary of a Teenage Girl looks at life from the perspective of a fifteen-year-old girl growing up absurd in an environment that provides little to no emotional support or guidance. Written by the director and based on the graphic novel by Phoebe Gloeckner, the film was the winner of the Grand Prix (Generation 14plus) at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. Minnie, in a remarkable performance by British actress Bel Powley ("A Royal Night Out"), is a confused and troubled teenager who lives with her divorced mother Charlotte (Kristin Wiig, "Welcome to Me") and her younger sister Gretel (Abby Wait).

It is an environment that seems to be modeled after media notions of the San Francisco hip culture of the sixties, though, in reality, there was very little counter-culture left in San Francisco by the mid-seventies. Powley captures Minnie's innocence and personal appeal as well as her more manipulative moments, and manages to portray her as likable in a sea of unsympathetic characters. A talented comic book artist, Minnie speaks into a tape recorder in her room to journal her quest for a meaningful relationship, but the tapes are filled with self doubt and feelings of isolation that threaten to morph into self-loathing.

The film opens when Minnie proudly announces that she's just had sex for the first time. Her sex partner, however, is her mother's 35-year-old boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard, "The Giver"), who freely enters into the relationship with the teenager, mindless of any ethical or legal concerns. Minnie is definitely not an innocent victim and Monroe is not a predator, but both act like emotional adolescents who are caught up in the moment and seem powerless to extricate themselves. Minnie's continued sexual relationship with Monroe enhances her self esteem and she has a stake in keeping it going regardless of the danger that her mother will find out.

The only real friend she has is Kimmie (Madeleine Waters) who brags of many sexual conquests herself and Minnie feels comfortable in confiding in her details about her affair with Monroe and other experiments that include different types of relationships with both men and women involving drugs and prostitution. Unfortunately, Minnie keeps coming back to Monroe who has by now become a sad character. The Diary of a Teenage Girl is an honest film that presents the characters and situations as they are without judgment or evaluation.

Yet while it does not judge its characters, it closes its eyes to morally dubious behavior, not commenting on Charlotte's outrageous invasion of her daughter's privacy when she listens to her private tape recordings which reveal the extent of her relationship with Monroe, or addressing the question of a parent's responsibility to provide emotional support for a an emotionally fragile teenager, regardless of the environment in which they are living.

While Minnie and Monroe go through the motions of self-reflection, ultimately there is little substance to their quest for self understanding. There is only an emptiness inside that the film touches on but hardly explores and leaves us with a sense of unfulfillment. Minnie tells her friend that Monroe has gone to participate in the EST Training in Sacramento which she describes as a self-improvement seminar. That is the last we hear of it, however, and we never see any positive results from Monroe's experience or that it in any way had touched his life. The only results that Monroe reports are that during the weekend he was arrested for drunk driving.

The message of the film is about the importance of loving yourself before you can love others and Minnie takes a long road towards that goal but female empowerment should not only be about sexual awakening but about integrity, taking responsibility for your life, awakening to the beauty and mystery of life, becoming involved in things larger than yourself. Given the emotional vacuum in which Minnie lives, there is nothing to indicate that any lessons have been learned. Ultimately, this is a film that displays the forms of self-awareness but lacks its substance.

Writer-director Marielle Heller gives us an almost voyeuristic look at a teen looking for self discovery. Minnie (Bel Powley) has no real self assurances, but finds her sexuality beginning to be a portal for her deeper discovery. She finds something in viewing herself in the mirror, but what would it feel like to have a lover's touch? Her artwork allows her to reach out to a female comic-creator (Susannah Schulman), and she records thoughts in her diary. She is desperate to share her experiences with someone in order to actually understand herself. Her friend, Kimmie (Madeline Waters), shares the adventure into sexuality. To boost her own sexual experience, Minne enters an affair with her mother's 35 yr-old boyfriend (Alexander Kkarsgard). Minnie is impulsive and craves sex; she has much to provide to pages of her diary.

This movie earns its R rating with strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and raw language. I found it worth watching more than once. A mood elevating soundtrack features: Mott The Hoople, T. Rex and the Dwight Twilley Band.

Also in the cast: Kristen Wiig, Miranda Bailey, Abby Wait, John Parsons and Carson D. Mell.

I watched this movie because the premise reminded me of a British film I'd seen, "Fish Tank". Maybe it was because of that high benchmark that I was thoroughly disappointed with "Diary of a Teenage Girl".

I am not the main demographic for this film, but that in no way should be used to excuse the faults it has. Despite the film being intended for teenage girls, its themes are universal. Themes like insecurity of identity, longing for love, and the confusing loneliness of adolescence are feelings known by nearly everyone. The issue this film has, thematically, is how it portrays its themes. Too often our protagonist, Minnie, would simply talk to her diary (a surrogate for the audience) about how she felt without any visual representation to convey those feelings.

For the most part the acting was stellar. Performances by Bel Powely and especially Alexander Skargard were particularly great. Kristen Wiig's performance was a little on the weak side, but due to her characters lack of contribution to the plot, it's excusable. The costume and set design were nothing special, they realistically portrayed the 70's which is all they really needed to do.

The cinematography was hit and miss. There certainly were some very pretty shots within the film. The two main problems with the cinematography were a lack of shot variation and how it was used to tell the story. Just about the entirety of the film was shot in either close up or a medium shot. The majority of the film was Minnie's face as she looked at something, and every now and then there would be a shot of what she was looking at. There was no notable camera movement and rarely were there more than 2 characters in a frame, neither of those things are necessarily bad but when it's all the film does for nearly 2 hours it gets stale fast. The visual metaphors were lacking in this film. As said before, Minnie would simply talk the themes at the audience directly rather than the film showing them through visual motifs. The only scenes with visual motifs present were those where she lays in the bath or looks at herself in the mirror and ponders her loneliness. But even those scenes feature her voice-over narration explaining her emotions rather than allowing the audience to decipher them alone.

The editing was slightly above average. The pacing was pretty good, although some scenes were cut short and then later referred to as being relevant when they didn't feel so. The sex scenes were kept at an appropriate length. Often films with prevalent sexual themes will shoot and edit sex scenes in a drawn out manner for the sake of shock value. This was not the case in "Diary of a Teenage Girl". Other good uses of editing were a few examples of cutting to sound to start a scene. Aside from that the editing was pretty standard.

The sound was not great. The music choice didn't work for this film, most of the songs sounded like typical indie/folk rock songs made from the last decade. The soundtrack didn't need to be "Dazed and Confused" but for a film set in the 70's, it would do it some justice to have at least one recognizable 70's song.

Much like the cinematography, the script was very hit and miss. The characters were all written to have the maturity of a teenager, even the PhD step-dad character. This was either done as a commentary on parenting in that generation, or as a way of showing how Minnie sees her world; as inhabited by those with a maturity level akin to her own. None of the characters, not even Minnie, were very likable although that was probably done intentionally. One fault the script had was the lack of development Minnie goes through. Towards the very end she does grow a little, but for the vast majority of the film the only changes to her character are external. Meaning things like how much drugs she's taking or how much sex she's having change, but internally she stays the same. It's only at the very end that her general attitude and her attitude towards Monroe change. There was no dialogue that stood out as especially clever but there was also no dialogue that was especially stupid. 

This film had its fair share of good bits but it failed to use them to tell a great story. With its plot dealing with such engaging subject matter, this film really fell short of its potential.

It was mediocre, maybe slightly below average. If you tend to like films like this, you'll probably get a decent amount of enjoyment out of it. Unfortunately, I did not. I'm rating this film as a weak 6/10, it might change to a 5/10 in the future.

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" should be re-titled "The Diary of a Ridiculously Lucky Teenage Girl, the Kind that Only Exists in the Movies".

It's a teen angst pic with a teen who has little, if anything, to be angsty about. The girl is ugly, and yet she has sex with typical Hollywood hunk Alexander Skarsgaard many times throughout the movie, and doesn't stop there. She also has to fend off the advances of a beautiful high school boy, who she of course also ends up bedding.

Oh, but we get obligatory scenes with her crying and screaming and wailing. About what?

She should be so lucky!

Come on. Teenage girls are just as horny and sex obsessed as the male variety. This story would have packed some kind of punch if the guys she got with were even half as believable. How would you feel about a "teen angst" pic about a boy, ugly, sullen and withdrawn, who loses his virginity to Elle McPherson one night, and then has to fend off the attentions of Jessica Alba, who he still ends up bedding.

Would you be able to take that seriously? Would you watch and empathise with his "angst" and cry his tears and want to hug him? Or would you just laugh at the ridiculous movie-land plot trying to be serious and meaningful?

What's the difference?

You are definitely watching 102 minutes of child abuse. In many scenes it's portrayed graphically, but from beginning to end child abuse makes up the content of the story. 

To Bel Powley: Why no teenage girls need to see a movie where there's underage sex and sexual assault? Where they see you small ugly good for nothing breasts and bum and almost shots of your vulva? What will that to to the British female teenage group? Do you know? It will encourage them to do what you and your character did on screen. And then the government will have to try to stop it as well as society.

We do not need film to educate us on how to love yourself, especially not after having sexual activity which is punishable by crime. We do not need a film to see your small, not sexy body or you to proclaim it is a taboo subject (there's so many ways to understand puberty and sex nowadays). We we do not need to say hey! See this film by bluffing your way or saying the film agencies rate it too high. 

It is just another "Fifty Shades of rape" film.
