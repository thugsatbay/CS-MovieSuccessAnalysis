### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
My girlfriend and I, both at or approaching our 50's, saw this in a theater that was absolutely filled with high school girls. That surprised me actually, given that most of the stars in this film are well-beyond high-school age. But they, like the rest of the audience, seemed to really enjoy this film, as did we. The relationships were nicely intertwined without being contrived ("Crash" anyone?), and unlike the similar movie "Love Actually," nothing portrayed was too outlandish. The convention of adding comments by "real" people to introduce story lines was well done and amusing. If I find any fault with the film, it's that all of the guys are presented as having relationship "issues" or as being total bone-heads. Hopefully there are more "nice guys" interspersed in society than what this film might lead you to believe (though I must say that the attitudes presented are definitely not inaccurate).

Overall, a very nice film whose 2 hour plus running time goes by rather quickly. If you've ever been in or tried to be in a relationship, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

A limp ensemble relationship movie that feels like the frustrated venting of a bitter single girl after a blind date gone badly awry.

This is the kind of movie where a bunch of 20 and 30-somethings own beautiful loft apartments they couldn't possibly afford and struggle with relationship issues that are just boring to watch other people grapple with if you yourself are over the age of 30. Once again we're expected to accept Jennifer Aniston as a sad sack who can't get a date after she dumps the long-time boyfriend (Ben Affleck, playing not so much a character as a woman's fantasy made real) who won't commit to marriage. Ginnifer Goodwin is the doormat who can't figure out why guys won't call her even though they say they will. Justin Long is terribly miscast as a womanizer who doesn't know when he's fallen in love himself (I can't look at him without seeing the image of his dork from "Dodgeball" getting hit in the face with a wrench, which is not far from what I wanted to do to his character in this movie). Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper are the lone married couple in the film, and because this is a Hollywood movie about relationships, of course the married couple MUST be miserable. Scarlett Johanssen is a bombshell with giant knockers that I couldn't take my eyes off of; Drew Barrymore might as well not be in the movie, and only is because a.) she co-produced it and b.) the filmmakers needed a forum in which to introduce a bunch of stock gay characters. You want to throttle pretty much everyone by the time the movie's over; I settled for thanking God I didn't have to be friends with any of them.

Though the film was only written by two people, it has the feeling of something written by committee. Characters aren't consistent or believable; those played by Goodwin and Connelly more often than not come across as mentally ill. In the world of this film, there are only two kinds of marriages: the ones that end in adultery and bitterness, or the ones that end in a ridiculously romanticized version of happily-ever-after. No wonder so many people have trouble making marriages work if they're using films like this as examples.

What a dud, and probably solid evidence that movies shouldn't be adapted from smug and jokey self-help books written by jackass talk show hosts.

The film starts with a little girl in a playground getting bullied by a boy, and her mother telling her that this means that the boy likes her, setting up the premise that the more a guy treats a woman like dirt, the more she'll hang around on the phone waiting for his call. From this point we follow the relationship woes of six (no eight, nine, is it ten?) different people and their relationships ups and downs, as one guy is trapped in a loveless marriage, one couple realise they want different things and one woman who is trying to figure out how to play the dating game, the stories cross and intertwine and from this comical situations ensue.

Now, from the tone of the last part of that sentence you may well have come to the conclusion that this is just another standard romantic comedy chick-flick, and, on paper, it should be. But it's not. The script is very similar in tone and feel to "When Harry met Sally" with "supposed" regular people introducing each chapter of the film, the insights are decent and the dialogue contains a lot of honesty that I think many people can relate to. The cast are all first rate with special attention going to Ben Affleck, who has so needed a good role in front of the camera for ages, and Jennifer Aniston as the couple who can't move forward, also good are Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connolly in their respective roles. The big star turns for me though are Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long as the hapless dater and the hapless dating coach, who are really good. For Long it's another step up the Hollywood ranks (pretty much the direction he's been heading since "Dodgeball") and for Goodwin it is a star-making turn that should do for her what "knocked-up" did for Heigl.

The film of course has a number of elements and outcomes that are extremely predictable (it IS a romantic comedy) but there's enough other stuff in there, and definite surprises at the end, to make it more than just the sum of its parts. It's charming, clever and, when viewed with a pantomime-style audience that I saw it with, a lot of fun, and I'm a guy! A cross between "When Harry met Sally" and "Friends" that doesn't try and jump on the gross-out comedy bandwagon.

Good stuff

I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I never read the book HJNTIY (seemed pretty self explanatory by the title alone) and I wasn't really sure how it could be made into a film, but I'll say I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

That being said, this is a CHICK FLICK--not a date movie. So don't be surprised by all the negative reviews written by guys--of course they can't stand it, and I definitely wouldn't try dragging your boyfriend to go see it for Valentine's Day...this is a movie you want to see with the girls. I wasn't that interested in seeing it, but I was talked into it and it was the perfect 2 hour distraction. The cast is fun to watch--Jennifer Anniston, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly are delightful on screen together, and I even take back all the bad things I've said about Ben Affleck--I thought he was a perfect fit for this movie.

It's also a very funny movie--I'm one of those people who love going to a packed theater where everyone laughs on cue and claps at the end, and this was one of those experiences. Some of the lines are priceless, and a couple of the funniest scenes in the movie involve "street interviews" à la Sex and the City Season 1. It's just an easy, fun, entertaining film--just relax and enjoy yourself, and don't try to hold this movie to a standard that it wasn't designed to meet. I'd go see it in a packed theater if you can, otherwise wait for the DVD and have a girls' night in!

It is rare for a Boy meets girl movie to please people now days. I mean lets face it Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle set the bar so high that anything else will pale in comparison.

But to me this movie kind of shows now modern relationships work or don't work. If anything is a falter in this story it is that it trys to hard to show too many stories. 

Sure there is X likes Y but Y likes Z but Z is married to A. Which is always entertaining.

Then there is the Ben Affleck / Jeniffer Aniston couple that may sum up most of the "couples" I know.

The whole mentioning of "new dating rules" is kind of cool to see that cell phones, emails, myspace and speeddating have replaced and re-written the rules for dating...and in some way made it harder not easier. Some people says this movie is full of stereotypes. In my opinion it covers just about all the realities in dating...especially dating in fast paced big city life.

What I liked though is the movie balanced "The Bad Guy" with "Bad Girl" Showing that there are breakups faulted by both sides. And there are regretful feelings for both Women and Men.

I would say rent it, hopefully you are not watching it alone.

I have just come from this movie. When will I learn not to pay money to see movies like this? When will directors learn that a good ensemble movie is very hard to make? Where is Robert Altman when you need him? I found it extremely hard to relate to or to find sympathy for the characters. Some of their actions were so unbelievably stupid that I just wanted to smack them. And what shallow lives they lived! Work, bar-hopping and texting. Character development was equally shallow. What epiphany did the Justin Long character undergo to realize that he was really "into" the Ginnifer Goodwin character? One confused meeting with the wait staff does not an epiphany make. The same goes for the Jennifer Aniston character realizing what a catch Ben Affleck's character was. So he washed some dishes. And why did he suddenly want to marry her....Because she suddenly didn't want to??? I would have thrown that engagement ring at his head. And what did the Jennifer Connelly character ever see in that wishy-washy (although good-looking) chump of a husband? The Scarlett Johansson character needed some serious therapy for that self-involvement problem of hers (or maybe a good slap upside the head). I guess the best thing about the movie is that it has given me a forum to write just how lackluster it was. I guess that will have to do.

A group of interconnected, Baltimore-based twenty- and thirty-somethings navigate their various relationships from the shallow end of the dating pool through the deep, murky waters of married life, trying to read the signs of the opposite sex... and hoping to be the exceptions to the "no-exceptions" rule.

Gigi just wants a man who says he'll calland doeswhile Alex advises her to stop sitting by the phone. Beth wonders if she should call it off after years of committed singlehood with her boyfriend, Neil, but he doesn't think there's a single thing wrong with their unmarried life. Janine's not sure if she can trust her husband, Ben, who can't quite trust himself around Anna. Anna can't decide between the sexy married guy, or her straightforward, no-sparks standby, Conor, who can't get over the fact that he can't have her. And Mary, who's found an entire network of loving, supportive men, just needs to find one who's straight.

If you've ever sat by the phone wondering why he said he would call, but didn't, or if you can't figure out why she doesn't want to sleep with you anymore, or why your relationship just isn't going to the next level... he (or she) is just not that into you. He's Just Not That Into You 7/10

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did the group of female friends I attended it with. It was well-written, well-acted, and funny.

I think the reason some people, er, men, didn't like it was because it portrays some men as lying cheats, others as terrified of intimacy, and some as weirdos. In short, the basic variety any woman runs into on Match.com. Then there were a couple of stand-up guy characters. Were parts of the plot formulaic? Sure. It's a movie. There were a few surprises, however.

All of the female characters were likable, which is a switch from standard Hollywood sexism. The acting was above average and I was pleasantly surprised by Scarlett Johannson's performance. I only didn't like Ginnifer Goodwin's slapstick-style performance as a desperate dater. A little subtlety would have made her character more poignant and more believable.

The film really does contain a lot of good advice for people in the dating scene, both men and women.

This sumptuous ensemble romantic comedy managed to exceed my expectations in every way. It was extremely hilarious and utterly realistic, and features an eclectic cast that all add something different to this intriguing tale of dealing with the pitfalls of dating and marriage.

The story begins with Gigi. After a first date, she becomes mildly obsessive waiting for the guy to call her during the week after. But he doesn't and this is the catalyst that eventually proceeds to link all the characters together in interconnected plot lines that range from funny and sweet, (Drew Barrymore's character bemoaning the fact that there's so much technology out there and she's managed to get dumped via email, MySpace and SMS) to tragic and heartbreaking (Ben Afflleck and Jennifer Aniston's characters not seeing eye to eye on getting married and so she would rather throw away their 7 year old relationship).

Scarlet Johansson also plays a pivotal role, that of a single woman who has a friend pining for her, but she would rather try and tempt a married man who himself is going through a rough patch with his wife, played to perfection by Jennifer Connelly. The way that this love-quadrangle plays out forms the basis for the realism factor, and while there are some sweet and tender moments, it's ultimately a tragedy that you can see is coming, because for this foursome, 2 people are gonna get hurt. And this plot line is expertly written.

Justin Long provides the voice of reason fashioned on the book on which the movie is based. His character, Alex, is the advice-dispensing guide who takes Gigi under his wing and tries to reveal all the ins and outs of dating dos and don'ts. And this masterstroke is how the movie becomes a guide just like the book, while also telling a story that many of us will see ourselves in.

The acting is all pretty faultless, with Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Brendan Cooper and Justing Long displaying some of their best work. Scarlet is as stunning as ever, and plays the temptress well, but Barrymore is sadly underutilized. In total, I think she might only have 10 minutes worth of screen time, but she does use it well.

And I wouldn't go so far to call this a 'chick flick', as I think there's just as much enjoyment and knowledge to be gained from this movie for us guys as there is for women. All in all, a perfect date movie.

After seeing the trailers you get a feel for what sort of a movie this is going to be. And the movie is exactly that - Nice romantic comedy.

I usually prefer to watch such movies only in TV or DVD but gave this a try simply for the star cast - Scarlett, Jennifer Anniston and Connelly, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Justin Long etc..But the person who stole the show was Ginnifer Goodwin. She had a bubbly enthusiasm about her character which made you root for her till the end. Connelly's role looked very similar to her role in "Little Children" Scarlet was OK. Barrymore's role was minuscule but her pun about technology was humorous. And Anniston is finally looking her age :-( The movie was just the right length. Mildly funny but mostly romantic. All in all an excellent pop corn movie.

Before I can even begin a criticism of the movie I have to ask: How can woman enjoy, and support, this film? The movie portrays women has whiny, desperate, and pathetic creatures who do nothing besides gossip and give each other relationship pep talks. The scenes where Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, and Ginnifer Goodwin are in the office where they are employed are perfect examples of this. Despite being educated, professional women, instead of working, they spend all their time discussing their relationships and consoling one another. As a young adult male I can honestly say that this is the kind of portrayal of women which makes men not take them seriously. The fact that women support and like this movie only gives further credence to these clearly prejudiced beliefs. So again how can women support a movie which portrays them so poorly? It makes about as much sense to me as Muslims supporting a movie about three young, college educated Arab men who work in the same office and spend all of their time making bombs and planning terrorist attacks. 

Now that that's out of the way, my major problem with the movie is that it has easily the worst script ever committed to screen. There is not an original bit of dialogue to be found anywhere. All of the characters are completely generic and unoriginal. Ginnifer Goodwin plays the crazily desperate woman, Jennifer Connelly is the woman who is cheated on, Benn Affleck plays the man scared of commitment, and Kevin Connolly plays the man chasing the woman who he will never get... I could go on, but honestly, why bother? The only exception to this is Drew Barrymore's character, which plays no important role in the movie at all. It seems like she went to the producers after the movie was already completed and said: "Hey I want to be in this movie, I'll pay you fifty million dollars if you give me a part." They agreed, shot two scenes where three multi-racial, stereotypical gay men give her dating advice and pep talks, and one scene where she and Kevin Connolly fall for each other completely out of the blue and for no other reason than that every major character needed to be in a couple when the movie ended. 

The other major flaw with the movie is that it is one of those rare romantic comedies which manages to be completely and totally devoid of humor. I only chuckled twice during the movie. Twice. In two hours. Two chuckles, not even real laughs, just quiet chuckles. Two

Finally, it was obvious to me immediately after glancing at the DVD case that the movie was going to be clever and totally original combination of Sex and the City and Love Actually. I was right. To conclude, the surest sign that this movie was awful is that my girlfriend, who loved Sex and the City and Love Actually, fell asleep for fifteen minutes during the movie.

Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is searching for her true love in the city of Baltimore. As she is set up by friends and co-workers, she often takes a shine to her dates but, frequently, the gentlemen involved never call her again. This could be, in part, because Gigi leaves phone and text messages for her dates to the point of scaring any caring men away. Meanwhile, a married twosome, Ben and Janine (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connelly) are restoring a lovely townhouse but having personal problems. This is compounded by the fact that hubby meets a yoga instructor-aspiring singer, Anna (Scarlett Johanssen) at a corner grocery and is smitten. Despite his protestations that he is married, the two meet again. Also in the "raven" city is a longtime-together couple, Beth (Jennifer Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) who are at odds, too, for Beth longs for marriage and Neil, despite his love for his lady, doesn't care for formalities. Finally, bar manager Alex (Justin Long) cynically gives advice to Gigi about men, real estate salesman Conor (Kevin Connolly) pines for Anna and newspaper ad-lady Mary (Drew Barrymore) is trying to make a love connection for herself, too. Will these fine folks get their "hearts desires" when it comes to amour? This is a fine, fine romantic comedy with an edge often missing from the standard fare. Yes, the characters in this film are searching for happily ever after but learn that reality may fall a bit short, sometimes. The ensemble cast is truly wonderful, with all of the actors giving nice turns as the romance seekers. But, then, they all have great lines to deliver, as the script is loaded with truth, laughs, and pathos. One surprise is that the Baltimore setting is absolutely lovely, especially the fine old apartment buildings where the characters dwell and the beautiful coast. Seeing these venues might tempt someone to book their next mini-vacation in this fine old town. However, the costumes are a mixed-bag, with Johannsen appearing gorgeous beyond measure and Goodwin looking fine, too, but J. Connelly sporting clothes that stifle her great beauty. On the other hand, the film's snappy direction and fine production values are assets. The bottom line is that while the film will please romcom enthusiasts it will also entertain those who usually attend movies of this genre with reluctance. Most filmgoers will get "into" this one and take home that feelgood spirit.

Never have men seemed so shallow or women so idiotic as in "He's Just Not That Into You." This attempt at romantic comedy falls desperately flat. For a film that wants so badly to be a lighthearted comedy, the laughs here are manufactured and weak. Random pop culture references and platitudes pepper this movie like a minefield, leaving its viewers stone-faced.

Several different characters are shown here in various relationships, and bizarrely collide by the end of the film. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is typecast as the desperate woman who sits by her phone for days waiting for that guy from the bar to call her back. This empty portrayal alone is enough to garner offense from women everywhere. She's shown as a sad, immature woman who has nothing better to do than to wait for Mr. Right.

Then there's Beth (Jennifer Anniston) who is in a long-term relationship with Neil (Ben Affleck), who refuses to walk down the aisle. Beth is the stereotypical woman longing to drag her man to the altar. Jump to Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly), who are unhappily married, yet avoid addressing the obvious. Believe it or not, Ben is led astray by a blonde bombshell in the form of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). This collaboration of boring, typical connections is nothing that hasn't been seen and done before.

"He's Just Not That Into You" is derived from a book by the same name, written by Greg Behrendt. The basic premise of this book is to educate women of the fact that men are dishonest jerks who seek to take advantage of them and/or break their hearts. Somehow, this man has managed to not only make a killing with his mind-numbing book, but also to capitalize on it by bringing it to the big screen. The by-product of this is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy.

The cast of "He's Just Not That Into You" reads like a who's who of Hollywood. Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston and Justin Long are just a few of the A-listers seen here. This simply adds to the mystery of why this movie is such a catastrophe. Apparently no amount of talent could have kept it afloat. The flat script, the forced humor, the clichéd situations and the confused intertwining of the characters all add to this disparaging production.

Although it is disguised as a fun loving date movie, "He's Just Not That Into You" spends most of its hour and a half running time over-analyzing simple encounters, patronizing and generalizing both sexes, and placing stereotypes everywhere. The concept of love is sent through the shredder and comes out completely destroyed on the other side. "He's Just Not That Into You" vainly attempted to be touching and warm hearted, but comes across as bitter and contrived.

Possibly if viewers check their brain at the door, they can enjoy this film. Otherwise, save your money and your dignity by skipping this mushy mess.

Since I'd expected mainly "fluff", I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that this film was instead an unusually WELL-DONE ensemble piece. There's a bunch of periodically-intertwined stories of different people looking for, avoiding and trying to improve love in their lives, with unanticipated twists, turns and revelations along the way. GINNIFER GOODWIN plays a needy woman who naively believes the lines she's fed, and JUSTIN LONG tries to clue her in reality-wise. JENNIFER ANISTON & BEN AFFLECK play a long-term couple with problems. SCARLETT JOHANSSON flits in & out of the lives of numerous people including KEVIN CONNOLLY & BRADLEY COOPER. DREW BARRYMORE, JENNIFER CONNELLY, KRIS KRISTOFFERSON and others effectively add to the mix. As a friend commented, he'd expected this to be a chick flick, & instead it was an unexpectedly thought-provoking and telling commentary on life today, with characters who strongly reminded him of numerous people he HIMSELF knows. While a drama, it's got a good deal of inherent humor, fine acting, and you'll likely find it strongly enjoyable.

Having a partner/sweetheart and getting married seem very difficult recently. All people in this film are occupied by the thought from morning to night every day. I was wondering if there is any other interests for them: job? school? hobbies? money? faith? dedications to others? dream other than opposite sex? Yes! They must have one(s). But due to the poor description of each personality in the script, all of them look rather foolish and shallow. Everybody may not live alone, so the theme in this film must be important. Only if the script had given other deep and various factors to each personality, this comedy would have been really funny and interesting. Though the cast is gorgeous, it is a pity that those actors cannot fully present their charms and acting skills.

A friend of mine on the thirties (single) told me that he loved this film because the tactics and bargaining between men and women really hit close to him. Young people on the ground might find this film interesting and useful. Older generation like me tend to think love affairs should be more direct and frank, spoiled by the old movies where men and women get into romance so easily. Well-mannered and more refined, nowadays young people must have a harder time.

By the way, the Japanese title of this film is funny: "Why Don't You Throw Him Away If He Is Such A Guy."

I don't mind chick flicks once in a while as long as they're worth my time, and HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU is worth every second. This is one of the best romantic comedy movies of the year that also holds a certain drama to it. I like how it doesn't have your usual chick flick clichés and yet it doesn't fail to make you go 'Aww!' What a great cast complimenting a really relevant story. You will be interested in every character, every situation, and every thought provoking reasoning and its fun ways to deliver them.

It is awesome how this movie takes everyday romantic situation that's not far fetched and injected them with effective comedy that's really funny and engaging. One way or another you've found yourself in similar situations before. You can't help but agreeing with all the truth that it's offering. And even if you don't agree with the game, the rule, and the exception, you can definitely find enjoyment in seeing the characters executing every self-help romantic lessons and street assumptions on the big screen. The only chick flick cliché left in here is the fact it still has those best friends who think they know all that and always give advices they don't take.

Rarely will a book-based movie make you curious about reading after watching the big screen version, but after watching HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, I might just find myself getting into the book that it's based on, by authors Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. There will be times when you'll feel the movie's runtime is a bit too long but that's usually what happens when you deal with an all stellar cast with interconnected plot ala Crash. But I think screenwriter Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein and Ken Kwapis make sure you'll always be curious to see what happens next. Once again if the story doesn't get you, the humor will. For some reason we won't get tired of the stereotyped portrayal that Gay people seem to know better about relationship than straight people.

When I saw this trailer months ago, I had my doubts,.. but I have them no more because every actor involved in this movie give excellent supporting performances. Not one outshines the others. These are current stars that can draw young adult audiences and they live up to the expectations. I'm glad Jennifer Connelly is there to provide the Oscar worthy drama, and Scarlett Johansson as the seductive temptress, even Ben Affleck is not too shabby in this one. Everybody has an essential part. And say what you want about Drew Barrymore, she may not be the hottest girl in the block, but kudos to her production company, Flowers Films that manages to invite such great talents for this successful collaboration.

This movie surprised us! We expected it to be okay, but its a really amazing movie. Thoroughly enjoyable and deals with something, most of us have dealt with(or are dealing with).

The nice thing about the movie is that I suppose everyone will be able to relate to one character or another (and in our case, a few) or at least an incident.

Its not a mystery but you want to keep predicting what will happen next, and I would give the story quite high marks for weaving everything in order, and quite intelligently at that.

Its romantic and its funny, the characters are nice, the script is fine, a really good movie to watch!

I just saw this with my girlfriend. We both enjoyed it, in my case, considerably more than expected after reading the slash and burn review in the New York Times. It is a genuinely funny movie that comes uncomfortably close to some of the realities of dating and relationships in the present.

I'll refrain from talking about how the various plots interrelate, since other people have already discussed them. Suffice it to say that all the relationships in the film are, to a degree, stereotypical and hyperbolic--because without that exaggeration, the film wouldn't be nearly as funny. 

The opening scene is terrific--that the decision about whether to have another round or not has to be considered at all says everything needed about whether Conor is interested in seeing Gigi again--in a word, no. Gigi, of course, doesn't pick that up, and holds out hope, bordering on obsession, that Conor will call her back. When he does not, she ventures to a restaurant Conor had mentioned going to, and thus meets Alex, played by Mr. Mac, Justin Long, who begins to clue her in about what men really mean by action or inaction. And as you'll guess, *SPOILER ALERT* Alex and Gigi wind up together--seemingly inevitably.

I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck--I thought they had a wonderful sense of ease and chemistry together, and although you could see the end of their story a mile away, it was fairly well done, even if a bit cloying. My favorite acting, though, was by Jennifer Connelly, as Janine. Her progression to self-realization was spot on, and her and Bradley Cooper's relationship was (sadly) all too believable. 

I wasn't as taken by the characters played by Kevin Connolly, Scarlet Johansson, and Drew Barrymore (who seemed to wander in and out of the film somewhat randomly). While they all contribute important, and even critical, elements of the film, they didn't seem to have the same sense of ease with the situations the script put them in. For example, for Kevin Connolly to go from a "player" to someone modelling clothes to appeal to a gay market struck me as a bit far-fetched. 

The technical elements are quite good--sets, costumes, lighting, music, and so on. There are some beautiful shots. I also quite liked the convention of using normal people to talk about each titled section of the movie. For me, it gave it a good sense of flow and grounding, helping tie the mini-theme of each section into the tapestry of the film. 

That said, the various stories weave together and come together about as you'd expect-- there are not many surprises in how things turn out. But that isn't the point of a movie like this--which is to point out and make fun of some of the realities of dating and relationships that exist today, and how far people will go to avoid facing an unpleasant reality. It is not Ghandi, or Thelma and Louise, and it is not supposed to be. 

Overall, it is a fun movie to see, and more thought-provoking than I thought it would be. Good writing, good acting, and a good blending of the various elements involved. It reminds me of Love, Actually--which is a good thing in my view. Enjoyable, just be ready to realize how close you come to what's being made fun of and commented on . . .

I happened to see this movie with my wife on Valentine's day. I had entered the theater with low expectations and the only reason I was keen to watch this was because of Ben Affleck and host of other starts. However, as the movie progressed I found myself starting to like it. By the time it ended I was glad it didn't turn out to be just another stupid romantic comedy made to pull the audiences with big stars.

The story is not new yet the script is cleverly written as it juggles between couples all somehow intertwined/related with each other added with nice style of presenting it, thus keeping the viewer interested.

The characters are from a wide range of people we encounter in real life. Alex, a guy who's an 'expert' on relationships. He keeps himself away from emotional attachments, runs a bar and plays an agony aunt to Gigi; a lady desperately seeking a soul mate. Next is Beth, Gigi's friend cum co-worker who is in a relationship with Neil since seven years and is very keen to tie the knot as opposed to Neil who loves Beth, is loyal to her but believes marriage is not an assurance of loyalty. This fact is proved by Ben; Neil's friend who's married to Janine (who also happens to be Gigi's co-worker) for around 8 years, but falls for Anna. Next follows a typical chase of 'A' following 'B', 'B' following 'C', hidden meanings, signs, a little humor here and there and related stuff.

Performances in this movie are fine by everyone if not exceptional. Ben Affleck and Drew Barrymore play their parts with ease. I liked Drew's small part, especially where she expresses her frustration with today's increasing use of technology which is leading people apart as opposed to bringing them together. Justin Long impresses with his performance and Scarlett Johansson is convincing as the temptress. The rest of the cast also do not disappoint as well.

What I didn't like about this movie was its length which I found to be a bit long. Also, the soundtrack of this movie is not very impressive, with a couple of exceptions. Finally it would've helped if it would have been more funny.

I would recommend this fresh take on love, romance, loyalty, marriage and things similar, to anyone who is looking for a good romantic comedy.

At first glance, "He's Just Not That Into You" has the right combination for a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy: a top-notch cast (including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long, among others), a cute love story, and a number of miscommunications and one-liners to get the audience laughing.

However, it's not just another romantic comedy. Instead, it has the rather bizarre mixture of being both a documentary and farce on the way men and women obsess over trying to decode one another.

"He's Just Not That Into You" tells a number of different story arcs between couples. Beth (Aniston) wants her longtime boyfriend Neal (Affleck) to propose to her. Ditzy Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) tries to look for a guy who will call back after the first date, with the unexpected help of the bartender Alex (Long). Ben (Bradley Cooper) is torn between his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and the beautiful Anna (Scarlett Johansson). The list goes on and on. In a style like 2002's "Love, Actually," all arcs are interconnected in some way. The film does a good job of keeping all the stories straight without confusing anyone by giving each character a distinct personality and smoothly transitioning between each story.

What makes this film stand out above others, however, is its exploration into the minds of men, women and their relationships that is on par with the 1989 comedy "When Harry Met Sally." It shows a reality of how each tries to dissect what the other is trying to communicate - what the guy means when he says "it was nice to meet you" after the date, for example. Ladies, how many times have you sat around with your friends going over every single detail to figure out how a guy feels about you? Gentlemen, how many times have you been perplexed by the actions of the opposite sex? This film seems to understand and laugh at your pain the same way your best friend might over drinks.

The actors play their parts well, giving them a personality that's realistically flawed and charming. The character Gigi, for example, is that one over-analyzing, guy-crazy, slightly pathetic friend most people know. Goodwin gives her character just the right amount of sweetness for us to still enjoy her even though she makes embarrassing mistakes and has slight stalker-like tendencies.

This film is a great date movie. It is funny enough for guys to laugh at, and has an "aww" factor most girls enjoy.

And if nothing else, you'll learn a little something.

This comes across as an unambitious film, the "B-production" sort of thing which ends up on DVD as soon as possible, giving some light practice to the star-studded cast between more serious projects. Having said that, it is a very well turned-out production, and the actors are obviously enjoying the roles, which heap one cliché upon another until the result gets a quality of its own. This is, I think, the way to go with clichés: avoid them if you have a point, but if the clichés are the point, go in all the way, and add more on top. Now in romantic comedy, the idea is that everything turns out well at the end, and no serious harm is done on the way. This is where this film is a cut above the genre, namely one particular character really gets hurt, and for a subtle and true-to-life reason: he lies one time too much. Romantic comedy is all about inner growth and coming to terms with oneself, so it gives a refreshing if somewhat bitter tang to the film to see, for once, what happens when one really cannot do that, including the collateral damage to others.

Scarlett Johansson is cleverly cast, superficially the "other woman" and home-wrecker, her spontaneity ends up setting a serious moral standard. I was sorry to see Jennifer Connelly in yet another role of over-strained and somewhat manipulative wife - this sort of typecasting is not bringing out the best in her, in my view, though I can see why they want her that way. Finally, Kris Kristofferson and Jennifer Aniston as father and daughter - I seem to note some faint resemblance between the latter and the young Sarah Miles. Was something going on at the back of the casting director's mind, or is it just me?

The needy Gigi Haim (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an young woman seeking her prince charming in unsuccessful dates. After dating the real estate agent Conor Barry (Kevin Connolly), Gigi anxiously expects to receive a phone call from him. However Conor never calls her and she goes to the bar where he uses to go expecting to see him, but she meets his friend Alex (Justin Long) that works in the place. They become friends and Alex helps Gigi to interpret the subtle signs of the men.

The aspirant singer Anna Taylor (Scarlet Johansson), who dated Conor, meets Ben Gunders (Bradley Cooper) in a supermarket and they begin a conversation, and Ben offers to help Anna in her career. Later Ben has a love affair with Anna, and his marriage with Janine Gunders (Jennifer Connelly) comes to an end.

Beth Bartlett (Jennifer Aniston) lives with Neil Jones (Ben Affleck), who does not believe in marriage as an institution. When Beth's sister informs that she will get married, Beth pushes Neil to marry her affecting their relationship.

"He's Just Not That Into You" is a delightful movie about marriages, relationships and affairs. The entwined story with many characters is supported by a realistic screenplay and a magnificent cast. I saw this movie in a flight and I have really appreciated. My vote is seven.

I'm still watching the movie as I type, but I felt inspired to offer it some kudos. First of all, there have been several moments of hidden humour in this movie that have given me spit-takes in my beer (and for those of you with wit, I suggest you indulge in the crab). I'm also impressed with the many layers to this movie, and its insight into the MANY LAYERS OF HUMAN DYNAMICS which are so often over-looked by superficial contemporary social society. This movie picks up on the fracked up realities of love, sex, and disinterest, with the commonalities and dissonance inherent to our dual genders. Quite frankly, this strikes me as the thesis film from an academic of love.

I watched this movie with my friend last Friday, I really wanted to watch this because the movie deals with love between men and women. The movie is suitable to single women who are not successful in making a lover, but try to pursue their real love. 

In the movie, there are some women with different love troubles in her daily life. Almost all women wonders why her boyfriend doesn't propose to marry or why he does not call after a blind date even though he says he will call you back. The movie sum up only one sentence about these kinds of scenes. 'He is just not that into you!!!'

By watching the movie, I surprised many times because the main characters seem like me whenever they meet boyfriend. For example, many women think that he likes me when several men care you and show good manner. In this way, Movie's characters often misunderstand such things. So, if you do not have boyfriend right now, you consider these errors about relationship and ways of thinking between men and women movie showed.

I really recommend that single women wanted to make boyfriend and success your love. It was very interesting movie watched these days.

so i went into this film not really knowing much about the story behind it, other then in the previews drew berrymore says something on the lines of 'he myspaced me' and then began to discuss flirting while texting. its funny to think that we all do it, we're in this huge generation who relies on technology to get our information and be our key resource to the outside world. it almost seamed as if i was watching a TV show with all of the different story lines going on. jumping from one story to the other was difficult to keep my focus, it seamed almost as if once i began to care about one character and put together the pieces of their problem, the story ended and went on to another character and their issue. the movie however did flow well, and the cast is HUGE with a ton of big name characters. it was definitely a movie i would take my girlfriends to see. it did run rather long however, about an hour into the movie i found myself loosing focus. however, that is when the story is starting to get good with the whole cheating aspect and loosing the one you begin to care about. cute movie, 6 out of 10.
