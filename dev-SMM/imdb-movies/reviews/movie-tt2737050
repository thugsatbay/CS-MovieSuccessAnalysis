### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This is my first Dardenne Bros film and at the end of this film I was like "I need to explore more of their films". This is a hard hitting slow story. It could be described as monotonous, but I would describe it as very very real. Following Marion's character, Sandra (la performance c'est très magnifique), we see the hardship of how a series of simple tasks turns into the hardest thing she has to do over the Two days and one night.

The Dardenne Bros and the Cinematographer Alain Marcoen used long shots, with very little cuts in certain scenes. At times whole scenes were just one shot. This left Sandra and Manu (Fabrizio Rongione) to hold the screen and make us believe what is going on and they did a great job with this. It allowed me to get into their emotions and into their lives of what they were going through. The lack of soundtrack also added that extra realism into the story.

I found this a heart wrenching and at times victorious film - a very good balance. The flow was great. It is slow, but just like Sofia Coppolo's Lost in Translation the slow-moving pace is necessary to tell the story.

I was able to get a ticket to this film at Festival de Cannes and it was received very well by the audience around us.

I'm off, now, to watch some more Dardenne Bros films!

The heart of this film does not lie in the simple plot, but in the portrayal of a woman, and her family, struggling with depression and the prospect of losing everything. 

After coming out the other side of an apparently lengthy battle with depression, Sandra (Cotillard) faces the prospect of losing her job if she cannot convince the majority of her colleagues to forgo a 1,000 bonus in favour of her staying with the company. One by one, she reaches out the her co-workers in the hope that she can convince them to vote for her to stay. On the whole, it is not these interactions that steal the show, but Sandra's own personal struggles with having to ask. The guilt she feels, pleading with people to give up money that most of them desperately need in order for her to keep a job she's not been at for months, coupled with her on-going struggles with depression and her own demons. Cotillard's performance is exceptional throughout, her frustration and upset so believable that it's easy to forget that this an actress playing a role. Anyone who has been affected by depression, either personally or indirectly, will find large portions of the film relatable and harrowing. 

A strong supporting cast and a truly moving script complete this understated gem of a movie.

A film is not about it's ending alone, especially not this one. The film is extra ordinarily realistic and simple. Marion Cotillard's acting just blew me away. If it was any other actress, I doubt that it would be interesting to stare at the same person for the entire length of the film. Loved every moment of it.

Use of natural light, long takes, lose head camera are all supposed to give you a boring film if you are used to the Hollywood style. But, just having a great script and Marion is enough to make any film special. Thanks for making this film. Short and sweet, That's this film. A story I could totally relate to. She made me cry.

I've never been a fan of Darwinian theory: why interfere when mother nature will straighten out the weak? Not especially after watching this simple, yet powerful film.

The Dardennes do not make make morality tales. Even though their characters navigate practical dilemmas that challenge their moral stance. This moral stance in turn, corresponds with realities in which these characters exist  it is a ramification of larger economic forces that govern the poor and working-class. 

It is with that in mind, that the Dardenne's narrative strategy reflects neorealist tradition and normative ethics. The main point has always been for us, the audience, to observe the conditions in these characters' daily lives, how they conduct themselves or negotiate problems and resolve dilemmas. In a Dardenne film, we're allowed to engage unobtrusively, without passing judgements on what they choose and how they arrive at those choices eventually.

Two Days, One Night is set against the backdrop of an industrial town in Liège, Belgium. Sandra Bya (Marion Cotillard) is a working-class wife and mother who earns her living in a solar panel factory. After a nervous breakdown, she is forced to take a break from work. The duration of her absence isn't known to viewers, but sufficient for supervisor Mr. Dumont to notice it was possible to cover Sandra's work if all 16 workers pulled an extra 3-hours per shift.

Soon, the factory's management proposes 1,000 bonus to each staff if they agree to make Sandra redundant. By the time Sandra returns to work and knows what happened, majority of her co-workers had opted for the bonus. Factory foreman Jean-Marc influenced their votes by saying if Sandra wasn't laid off, maybe they (her co- workers) would be. Regardless, her fate has been sealed via democratic means.

Concerned friend and colleague Juliette appeals to Mr. Dumont and negotiates a secret snap ballot. Everyone will vote first thing Monday morning  will they choose the 1,000 bonus or Sandra? Because the factory's management surely could not afford both.

Two Days, One Night refers to the weekend: rest days where hard workers retreat in comfort to the sanctuary of their homes and private lives. When Sandra is forced to intrude people's lives on a precious weekend, visit each and every one of her 16 co-workers in a bid to change their minds before Monday (I use the word "forced" because clearly, Sandra was embarrassed and reluctant to do it), at one point she laments in self-disgust saying "I can't stand it. Every time I feel like a beggar, a thief coming to take their money. They look at me ready to hit me. I feel like hitting them too." But kitchen worker and husband Manu urges with maturity and understanding, "You have to fight for your job." Both knew Sandra cannot quite walk away and abandon work at the small factory. The family of four has just recently moved out of public housing. Sandra needs the minimum wage job to keep their heads above the water, to keep from going back to welfare assistance.

Much of the film has Manu drive Sandra around the small town of Liège, as the 48-hours clock goes ticking down with growing intensity. The first dilemma is presented as she goes knocking door- to-door, trying to convince fellow employees to give up a salary bonus that they too, badly need. Times are hard and money is tight, her interactions with each co-worker and their subsequent response to her plea is compelling to watch. Lesser film-makers will settle with a cookie cutter protagonist in need of sympathy, but this isn't the case with Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne.

There is a real sense here that the space and reality of this film has the relevance of modern social-political commentary. "Will you vote for me?"  the same question when asked repeatedly, becomes illuminated by varying personal realities. Thus allowing the audience to consider the same situation with changing arguments and evolving perspectives. Every step of the way, the audience absorbs a broad spectrum of humanity as reactions toward Sandra ricochet between doubt and certainty: selfish and cruel, unapologetic and indifferent, defensive and guilt-ridden, conflicted and hesitant, kind and compassionate. At one point, it had me wondering if Sandra, for the sake of some colleagues so dangerously close to the margins of poverty, probably shouldn't be appealing at all  after all, their knapsacks are so much tinier and more fragile than the sling bag draped across her hunched, bony shoulders.

All the above reflects just one, out of several more thought experiments found in the plot design. One particular sub-plot examines Sandra's level of resilience as a recovering depressive, and culminates in an episode involving a box of Xanax. Here, Marion Cotillard turns in her role with master class technique  she applies subdued, matter-of-fact emotional tone with the kind of authenticity and resignation made possible only by an exhausted, dehumanized, defeated soul. Less is accurately more. 

When I saw L'Infant at the Alliance Française de Singapour back in 2005; I was a young adult in her early twenties with the intellectual capital and moral patience of a fish. Coming out of my first experience with the Dardennes, my opinion towards main character Bruno, was straight forward and quite simply, disapproving  what kind of person sells his own newborn child for a meagre sum of money? I left the small theatre with obvious answers and a snap conclusion, partially dissatisfied and disappointed with the film's ridiculous premise.

Nearly a decade has passed and now having watched Two Days, One Night; I find myself weighing all variables in the complex social totality embodied by one simple observation: "Some people are so rich they don't know what it means to live with so little." I no longer believe in moral absolutes with the reckless naiveté of a youth. What an honest, complex and thought provoking film. How wide-ranging and realistic.

Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's latest working-class odyssey, Two Days,  One Night, takes place over the course of a weekend. It is a weekend  that will forever remain etched in the mind of Sandra (Marion  Cotillard), a worker in a small solar-panel factory who has to fight  for her job in the face of management cutbacks. Given a choice between  a 1,000 Euro bonus and keeping Sandra in her job, fourteen out of  sixteen voted for the bonus, persuaded by the factory foreman Jean-Marc  (Olivier Gourmet) that others may face layoffs if they vote for Sandra.  Sandra's self-image is low, having recently suffered a nervous  breakdown, and her lack of self esteem is reinforced by her co-workers  decision. 
As she tries to raise two small children (Pili Groyne, Simon Caudry) on  her husband's income as a cook, she is fearful of going back on welfare  and living in public housing. Fortunately, her husband, Manu (Fabrizio  Rongione), is there for her, urging her not to give in but fight back.  Fortunately, Sandra also has support at work and her friend Juliette  (Catherine Salee) catches the firm's manager (Baptiste Sornin) on  Friday afternoon, and persuades him to revisit the issue in a silent  ballot on Monday morning. In spite of her reluctance, she decides to  personally contact those who voted against her by going to their homes  and try to persuade them to change their vote, although she knows it is  going to be a hard sell. In order to get a majority, she knows that she  will have to get seven more colleagues to change their vote, but  initially she gets a mixed reception. 
One worker refuses to talk to her, another becomes belligerent but many  simply say that, because of economic conditions, they simply need their  bonus to keep functioning, one to pay his daughter's tuition, another  because they need the money to build an addition to the back yard. Each  situation is different and there is no attempt by the Dardenne Brothers  to load the dice emotionally for Sandra or render judgment on the ones  that turn her down. She simply states her case, letting people know  that that her husband is a kitchen worker and that she may have to move  back to public housing if she doesn't work. Her appeal is to people's  sense of decency, and her resentment of the fact that people have been  put in this untenable position. 
Sandra's visits a young father (Timur Magomedgadzhiev) coaching a  soccer team who heartbreakingly cries when he sees her, ashamed that he  voted against her the first time even though she had been of great help  to him as a new worker. There is also an interchange with a short-term  contract worker (Serge Koto) who is afraid of being fired if the  foreman finds out how he voted. Though it is unintended, Sandra finds  that her visits have an effect on people's lives. One young woman Anne  (Christelle Cornil), finds herself wanting to support Sandra but is  bullied by her husband, a situation that causes her to wake up to the  reality of the relationship. 
Two Days, One Night keeps us riveted until the final result, as tense  as any tightly contested political election. Cotillard does an  outstanding job as the working class woman battling against her fears.  Though highly recognizable from previous high profile roles, she blends  into the character seamlessly. Ultimately, the film is not about  economic struggles, depression, or a choice between selfishness and  compassion. It is about an individual taking responsibility for her  life, and in the process, transforming its very fabric and the lives of  the people around her. Like the rest of the Dardenne's body of work, it  is powered by a resolute faith in humanity.

It's as low key and quiet as a film can get. It's not enhanced for comedy, action, or drama. Just a realistic human story of the basic struggle to make ends meet in this world.

It's the type of movie that separates the movie geeks from the film geeks. 

As a film geek, I can appreciate how the filmmakers did so much with so little, especially actress,Marion Cotillard. 

The movie counts on her being realistic, all the way down to the weight it looks like she lost in order to play a woman who just got over an illness, and in order to get her job back spends a weekend visiting her coworkers in order to convenience them to vote for her to get her job back in a secret ballet on Monday, over a big bonus they would all get if she stays laid-off. She had to be believable as a proud woman who did not want to ask her coworkers of this, she did not want their pity, but she needed to support her family, a situation all of her coworkers are also in. It's a truly unbalanced and unfair situation for everyone and Marion did an excellent job portraying how uncomfortable that is. 

As a movie geek, though the movie was watered down with absolutely no sugar, I'm glad it was not boring. It helps that the subject is something almost everyone who has a job in this economy can relate to, no matter which side of the equation you're on. 

Definitely the type of picture we'll all be discussing long after the film is over. '

This French-language film is both written and directed by brothers Jean Pierre & Luc Dardenne and set in their native Wallonia part of Belgium, poorer than the Flemish north of the country and hard hit by the post-2008 recession. It is the complete antithesis of the Hollywood movie: slow and deliberate with no special effects or action sequences.

A small company has a vote of its workforce which decides that it would rather all the staff receive a bonus than take back a female colleague who wishes to return to work after a bout of depression. The woman at the heart of this moral dilemma is Sandra, played by the talented French actress Marion Cotillard, who has just a weekend to persuade her colleagues to change their mind. Essentially this is a film about solidarity - or lack of it - not just in the workplace but also at home and shows how different factors influence our decisions and how those decisions have consequences for ourselves and for others.

Belgian screenwriters, producers and directors Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne's ninth feature film which they co-wrote and produced, premiered In competition at the 67th Cannes International Film Festival in 2014, was screened at the 42nd Norwegian International Film Festival Haugesund in 2014, was shot on locations in Belgium and is a France-Belgium-Italy co-production which was produced by producer Denis Freyd. It tells the story about a mother named Sandra Bya whom whilst dealing with illness and learning from hearsay that her job is at risk, contacts the person accused of the rumor and asks permission to start a secret ballot. 

Distinctly and engagingly directed by Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws an immediate and interactive portrayal of a working-class husband and wife whom is raising their adolescent son and daughter. While notable for its distinct and atmospheric milieu depictions and reverent cinematography by cinematographer Alain Marcoen, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about a person whom whilst barely hanging on begins fighting with everything she has in her to prevent her employees from taking her work away from her, by a duo of filmmakers who remains in reminiscence for a thematically related feature film, depicts a dense study of character. 

This socio-political, somewhat conversational and increasingly heartrending character piece which is set in Belgium in the 21st century and where a Belgian citizen has to locate every one of her sixteen co-workers whom has been promised a bonus and ask them to vote in favor of her keeping her job, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, rhythmic continuity, use of music, comment by Sandra : "Thank you for your support" and the timely understated and noteworthy acting performance by French actress and singer Marion Cotillard. A cinematically realistic, resonating and ingeniously democratic narrative feature.

You absolutely will be disappointed if you are looking for a "robot fighting robot" movie or anything superficial, or beautiful woman. (Well no one can say Cottilard is not beautiful, but she deliberately gives up her beauty to fit the character.) 

This movie shows us what real emotions is. It reveals life in such a vivid and convincing way that you'll think about your own life, although you may be a lot better off than the characters.

After all this movie is a feast of fine acting, a reason that movies are still called art, and a spirit lifting experience that is going to linger on for a long time after you finish it.

What a great film, totally awesome. A movie that glues you to your seat, although this is not a suspense movie at the start. But it becomes so, more than any thriller.

The story of a struggle for a Young female employee to keep her job after the decision from her manager to fire her. The same manager who just before gave the choice to the other employees: to fire the woman and give a big Bounty to all of them OR keep the female and NO BOUNTY for everyone...

A cruel choice given by the manager. 

So, all along the film, you Watch the poor woman trying to persuade one by one her colleagues to give up their Bounty so that she can be kept in the company. 

Cruel at the most. 

It's a pure sacrilege to miss such a film. A terrific study of the human nature, the human behaviour at its best but also at its worst. Sometimes during the movie, I nearly wept, and at other moments, I wanted to howl. I was disgusted by some characters. 

A movie that Ken Loach could have made, but maybe with more humor...

The sequence where Marion Cotillard tries to commit suicide, with so much calm, in a so meticulous way, this reminded me the nearly same sequence in ROSETTA - also directed by the Dardenne brothers - when Emilie Dequennnes tried to take her own life. 

A pure masterpiece. you can't live without seeing such a pure gem.

When this came out, I read the five-star, hyperbolic reviews with interest and hoped to see this in the cinemas, but - like most foreign films - it came and went too swiftly. So, it was with great anticipation that I caught up with this just the other night on DVD.

My lord, I'm glad I didn't pay out cinema prices for this.

Flat, dull, dramatically inert and lacking any cinematic language, this piece does exactly what it says on the tin: no more, no less. In short - in case you didn't know - a worker in a factory has a weekend to sway a vote taking place on the Monday that will give her co-workers a bonus but deprive her of her job. Her task, over "Two Days, One Night" (although technically it's two nights) is to convince her fellow workers to forego their bonuses and let her keep her job. A big ask, ripe with dramatic potential.

Or so you'd think.

Instead, we watch as the character plods from place to place, rings doorbells, recites the same plot précis over and over again, receives one of two answers or some mealy-mouthed in-between, then plods to the next place. If they're not in and she's directed to somewhere they might be, you get to see her walk there, too. It feels, almost as if it's shot in real time. It's irritatingly repetitive and flat. The protagonist has suffered a mental breakdown of some unspecified sort, and is popping Xanax along the way to keep her going, which also results in the actress, Marion Cotillard, approaching the role looking slightly stunned, stressed and unhappy, which adds further to the lack of drama. Despite the fact that she's fighting for her life (or so you're led to believe - the ending belies this) she doesn't seem to really care, and at times appears to be doing the rounds only because her husband and two of her work colleagues are pushing her to do so. 

And so it goes. Plod, plod, plod. Recap, answer, recap, answer. It's dreary, dull and drained of any vestige of drama in an effort for some sort of social "realism", as if it's a fly-on-the-wall documentary. It is anti-film, with no trace of imagination, no spark of inspiration and an ending that undermines all that's gone before. Even this might - just MIGHT - have worked with a bit of focus, a bit of cinematic intelligence, but it passes off as the rest of the film has, in monotone.

All in all, this is a deeply enervating experience and a waste of a potentially interesting story.

"A woman is like a tea bag  you never know how strong she is until she gets in hot water." - Eleanor Roosevelt 

How many of us would fight as hard as Sandra (Marion Cotillard) to keep her job? I suppose we would try to keep it, but she has to convince a majority out of 16 fellow workers to vote her employment rather than their 1000 Euros bonuses. She journeys in this intense film like some mythical mariner to each island person to convince that they should vote for her.

Not only does Sandra experience a heavy dose of humiliation by virtually begging to be kept as an employee, she also has to deal with her insecurity and the accompanying dependence on drugs to help her through this challenge and her recent depression. The film's limitation is the repetition for each co-worker she visits, as if they just repeat the script for each visit. Even when one segment turns violent, it's as if writer/directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne injected action in an otherwise flat line of activity. Overall, the Dardennes further their thematic interest in socialistic causes.

What elevates this drama into Oscar consideration is Cotillard, dressed not like a movie star (see La Vie en Rose and Midnight in Paris) but a working girl, little makeup accompanied by sleeveless tees and serviceable jeans. Make no mistake; she still is one of the world's most attractive actresses, my current fav. However, here she is believable as a vulnerable mother grasping for her job that the family desperately needs to survive.

Yes, although she has a contributing husband, Manu (Fabrizio Rongione), he is unusually supportive, almost to a fault. Yet, dramatically, he's positioned well to keep her in the forefront. She's not Sally Field's Norma Rae, who fights for a union in her textile mill, because Sandra's cause is personal in the 21st century, where Norma's in the '70's is about collectivism. Both women, however, have an intelligence and wit to get them through. As far as I'm concerned, that's part of what feminism is about.

This is a peach of a movie.

If you like continental European films and have a penchant for a gritty, realistic genre, which brings the dramas of everyday life to the big screen in totally believable and original ways, then this is a film you shouldn't miss.

This Belgium offering was directed by the multi-award winning (Cannes) brothers, Jean-Pierre & Luc Dardenne, and stars the beautiful French actress, Marion Cotillard, who had to learn to speak with a Belgian accent and 'dress down' to make her look more 'ordinary'. Cotillard will never look totally ordinary, but she does a wonderful job of making you believe that she is a struggling young Belgian mother who is recovering from depression and receives some devastating news from her employer.

Her workmates had been asked to vote  either for her to be dismissed and still receive their annual bonuses, or to let her continue to work and, as a result, forfeit their bonuses. The film relates the young wife's efforts over a single weekend to try and persuade the staff to change their minds after her boss agrees to hold a new ballot on the Monday morning.

It doesn't sound like much, but trust me, it is riveting.

I don't know why, but one of the user reviewers has compared this film to Lost in Translation, which I personally think was a boring load of nonsense. The truth is that this film is nothing like 'Lost in Translation'. This is a film full of heart-wrenching emotion, which explores the good, the bad, the selfishness and the generosity of the human spirit as the young mother embarks on a series of one- to-one meetings  sometimes confrontations  with her fellow employees, over a long weekend.

Collitard is just superb in the role and is well deserving of the film's single Oscar Nomination for Best Actress. All the supporting actors, representing today's diverse Belgian society, also act their hearts out as working class folk, trying to make ends meet during the recession and desperate to keep hold of their bonuses for one reason or another.

It is a truly 21st-century moral dilemma.

Needless to say, both the professional and user movie critics are pretty much united in their views that this is a very fine film. Collitard was nominated for Best Actress Oscar for her wonderful portrayal in this film; but of course, as usual, it went to one of the Hollywood 'in' set.

My review is going to be full of spoilers so be aware. From the very beginning the director has not tried to give the movie a beginning or an end. The movie through the idea of persuading people for votes portrays the different characters that you would see around you, at work, in college etc. It is never about the the result of the vote but rather about the interactions that Sandra makes with the characters. It is about the inner conflict that the characters go through and the small peek that the story gives Sandra into their lives. 

For the main character the process was always meant to give her the will to fight. To this end it would have helped if the movie ended without the vote. But I must concede that the end is not predictable. 

The director has resisted the urge to use emotional props (eg the kids) in the story which is beautiful.

See this movie for the beauty of day to day interactions and insights into human nature.

I confess I have some kind of hopeless crush for Marion Cotillard, she of the cat-like eyes the color of the sea. Who doesn't? 

She is marvellous here; not at her most glamorous - meaning she (appropriately) looks like a pretty 40 years old woman instead of a stunning model - but her performance is the best I've seen her deliver.

Working mum Sandra, struggling with depression, has only a week-end to persuade her colleagues to vote for keeping her instead of having her fired and getting a bonus (strange and horrible as it sounds, it's apparently out of the newslines). It's like a millennial version of Twelve Angry Men, where a blue-collar protagonist fights to save her job. As she tracks down her co-workers in supermarkets, soccer fields and apartment buildings, some are encouraging, others petty, apologetic or bitter.

In a cinematic age of superheroes facing apocalyptic countdowns, it's refreshing to follow a movie where stakes feel so believable and down-to-earth. It could have been ponderous, but the Dardenne brothers keep everything so sober and understated, the result is compelling. No cheesy lines or excessive posturing - just strong performances and real- life stakes as the clock ticks against Sandra and her future, until an affecting epilogue.

If Kristen Stewart was up for the American remake of Two Days, One Night, it would be another no-brainer role for her. And still, she wouldn't have come close to performing her normal depression role as Marion Cotillard did.

I really enjoyed this French film despite it really being a downer. It seemed so simple and frivolous on the surface since the whole "struggle" is her keeping a job that doesn't want her, she only wants for employment and the fact there HAS to be another job in all of France for her to seek. But, the movie is much more deep than that, merci(fully.) 

Pretty much not an American practice at all, on a Friday, employees at a small company are allowed to vote on either to accept a 1,000 Euro bonus (which I guess is a lot) or have Sarah (Cotillard) laid off. The film shows her weekend where she struggles with convincing her peers to vote for her at a re-vote on Monday and her growing depression.

Granted, I would just go look for another job. I can see how others would want to hold onto their huge bonus and I would feel bad about taking so many people's huge bonus. Personally, I would gladly give my bonus so someone could keep their job  there would be NO question I would do that, but on the flip side, I wouldn't want someone to have to give up their money for me.

The film shows a real look at depression and I could connect with that due to growing up with people close to me that experience that daily. That and the fact it felt real overall made me like this original take on economy downturns and business practices that are just as real there as it is here in the United States. Recommended!

* * *

Final thoughts: Yeah, I did keep seeing Kristen Stewart here, and even though she's sulky and depressed in 90% of her performances, I can't see her act a tenth of what Cotillard did. Maybe Stewart could contact her for real acting lessons.

Typical of a Dardennes brothers film, the central character valorously pursues a simple quest that proves character defining. Also, everything feels real, natural, unstaged, their remarkable artistry notable only in its emotional and intelligent effect.

The opening shot is a close-up of Sandra asleep amid a barrage of coloured patterns. In the closing long shot she is walking away down a bright street, her confidence and self-worth restored, a figure of new agency instead of the company's passive victim. There's now a spirit in her step. The first shot shows her in herself, barely coming out of depression. The second places her in the outside world. 

Here's the film's central irony. The company makes solar cells. That is, a modern forward-looking company publicly intent upon saving the ecology has no concern for the individual lives of its workers. The new righteous capitalism is as heartless as the old. To the film's credit, no-one here states "We workers have to unite against the heartless greedy bosses." But that's one subtext.

Sandra is about to return from sick leave. The bosses have given her unit a choice. If they vote to fire her each will get a 1,000 Euro bonus. The foreman's suasion led to a 14- 2 initial vote against her, but she and a friend have persuaded the boss to hold a second, secret ballot. Sandra has the weekend to persuade seven conversions. She falls one short. 

The workers' responses reveal the hardship that the current economy and business practices force on workers. They all need the money, so few will serve her need. Few will stand up against the brutal choice the company has forced on them. 

Some of the responses are remarkable. The immigrant kids' soccer coach cries in shame that he had voted against her. He remembers she saved his job by taking the blame for his accident. Another man cries when his need for the money prevents his doing what he knows he should. A man changes his mind after his hothead son knocks him out, furious that Sandra should be claiming their hard-earned bonus money. 

Another immigrant, on a limited term appointment, decides to support her, changes his mind when he realizes the foreman's revenge would cost his extension, but ultimately votes for her. That helps her to refuse the company's compromise offer. They would pay the bonus and lay her off now, then rehire her in place of one of the limited-term people. Rather than continue in the company's unnecessary pressuring of its employees she walks away. 

To reach that growth Sandra has to overcome several problems. She feels emotionally exhausted. She doesn't want her colleagues' pity. She feels she is begging for their support. She dreads the work climate if they should lose their bonus for her to keep her job. Yet she needs the money, for her two children and to handle the mortgage she shares with her short-order cook partner. Her insecurity even leads her to doubt her partner's love. Despair prompts her to a suicidal overdose, which she aborts when a worker comes over to support her. Indeed, she's leaving her husband because he refused to let her support her. 

Two songs on the radio mark her growing spirit. The first her partner turns off to protect her spirit, but she turns on full blast: It's All Over. The second the couple and new divorcée sing exuberantly together, Gloria. Sandra grows from resignation to glory.

If the eight supporters provide some hope, more is offered by the children. They instinctively want to help, like her kids wanting to carry the pizzas and the little black girl wanting to escort her to see her father in the laundromat. People want to help each other, to work together, if only their bosses wouldn't find profit in pitting them against each other.

Very,very dull movie. Predictable. Little excitement or plot twist/invention. You know when the end is coming and what it will be and then wish that you hadn't stayed hoping against hope that something interesting might just happen. I like the moral and social message of the film; however, it could of been dealt with in a more entertaining manner. I am not a fan of Hollywood blockbusters and enjoy European/low-budget films but this is seriously overrated by the critics. Lets type in some more words so that my review will qualify for the ten line minimum which I feel is far too much to talk about this particular movie or any movie of a poor standard. Almost there. Ahhh yes.

a choice. a fight. and the final decision. not the story is impressive but the great science of detail. the story is so simple than only the nuances are the clue. all is clear. and you imagine the answers of each character. and , at first sigh, no surprises. but... . it is so easy to say Marillon Cotillard did a great job. but her impressive virtue is to escape from the screen. the story becomes, scene by scene, so realistic, than it is, step by step, a personal problem of the viewer. and this is the axis/the key/ the source of force and strange, convincing beauty of this drama. to be... alive. and, after the final credits, to say only - it is an admirable work.

Imagine trying to recover from depression only to discover that your illness was in danger of costing you your job; or worse, that in your absence your boss had asked your colleagues to vote for retaining you, or receiving their annual bonus. Imagine then having to visit those colleagues and beg them not to vote for you to lose your livelihood. This is the grim scenario for the Dardenne brothers' film 'Two Days, One Night', whose strength lies in the fact that nothing is presented in an overly melodramatic fashion: it's a simple, hard story of people doing what they have to do, as best as they are able. In a a way, it's also the film's weakness: in a moment of inner despair, the lead character overdoses, but it's so internalised that the incident is strangely quiet and unremarkable. But overall, the film is a telling exploration of the scope, and limits, of human solidarity; and the ending is a nice mixture of the positive and the realistic.

This film is about the economics of the economy, the impact on its workers and the inhuman decisions one has to make to survive. It is also kind of an exploration about recovering from mental illness, but not completely. Ultimately its about overcoming.

Other than its insane premise, unbelievable in its all too mundane believability, it is a mostly pat story arch told with "realism" and a splendid performance from Marion Cotillard and not much more. It feels like the premise was concocted first and the characters (and by extension the mental illness) and ending tacked on to make it workable.

Marion Cotillard is one of the best french Actress and this movie purely reflect the reason why .

Whenever Marion is doing a French Film she is something else , i totally adore her acting Skills 

Two Days, One Night is a very simple themed drama movie , but it's the masterful work of Marion , Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne , and everyone else related to this project that make this simple themed indie movie a Cinematic Art .

I absolutely love the simplicity of this movie .

A must watch for all Drama Lover .

I heard nothing about Two Days, One night before I decided to check it out on Netflix, and I must say that this is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a while. Actually it's just one of the best films I've seen in a while.

Two Days, One night tells us a story of a woman's desperate attempts to persuade her co-workers into making a very important decision that determines her future. The story focuses on human nature and our ability to give something up for someone we barely know. It feels incredibly intimate and human throughout and there were times where the emotions were so raw that I kept forgetting that I'm just watching a film. It felt so real and I really wanted to see this character succeed, mainly because her character was so well acted. The plot is very simple but there is a wavering sense of unpredictability and even tension as we watch this desperation-fueled journey unfold. The main plot line sets off many little strings of other interactions that I would never have saw coming, making this a unique and highly enjoyable first viewing.

The acting all around was fantastic. Our main character, played by Marion Cotillard, was emotionally broken and this actress did an amazing job showing it. She covered so much range in her performance that I simply could not keep my eyes off her, for more than just the obvious reason. She was excellently formed as we constantly see her entire demeanor and mannerism change after every character interaction. She reacted realistically in a way that made me feel very immersed within the film's story and narrative. I greatly wanted to see this character succeed at her goal, and if she had not been as well acted, I definitely would not have cared as much. Another great thing about Two Days, One Night, besides the excellent acting, is that we can all relate to it's personal and socially accurate storytelling.

Our character is seen asking many individuals to make quite a large sacrifice. The great thing is that we all know what this feels like. So we can place ourselves in the shoes of either character and feel incredibly attached to the story. This constant feeling of immersion and realism felt absolutely perfect and there was not one second where I felt like the film dragged or included an unnecessary scene. I enjoyed every second of it and I really didn't want it to end. But when that time did come, it felt extremely satisfying and understandable. There was no complex enigmatic riddle to solve or deep metaphor with infinite possible meanings to interpret. The ending was just as meaningful without any of these things. 

I thoroughly enjoyed Two Days, One Night. It tells an interesting story that could very well happen to anyone. It was involving, emotionally raw, and just fantastically human.

Watching Inception again a few months ago with a family friend,I got told that co-star Marion Cotillard has done a number of strong French films.Taking a look one day round Netflix UK,I was very happy to find one of Cotillard's titles on the site,which led to me getting set to watch it,for two days and one night.

The plot:

Trying to get back into work after battling depression, Sandra discovers that her workmates have voted her out,in exchange for a 1000 Euro pay rise.Talking to friend Julien,Sandra discovers that manager Jean-Marc threatened some of the workers with the sack,if they did not vote her out.Getting hold of the company CEO,Sandra gets a second vote agreed on,in two days time. Needing over half her fellow workers to vote on her side,Sandra decides to spend the next 2 days meeting each worker,and putting her case across to them.

View on the film:

Coming from the documentary world,co-writers/directors Jean-Pierre & Luc Dardenne soak the film in an incredibly intimate atmosphere,via long takes giving each of Sandra's meetings with her fellow workers a rustic glaze. Keeping away from any "big" camera moves,the Dardenne's marvellously follow Sandra with well-held hand-held cameras,which along with giving the movie an on the spot presentation,also gives all the conversations in the title a stark, naturalistic quality.

Set against the financial crisis, the screenplay by the Dardenne's turns off the TV channels to focus on what effect the events are having on people at the bottom of the ladder.Taking an episodic edge,the Dardenne's use each meeting to gradually bring themes from the background to the front of the screen,from the very male-dominated workplace,to Sandra discovering her own independence. Walking on egg shells whilst hold her head high, Marion Cotillard gives an extraordinary performance as Sandra. Slumping her shoulders with each rejection, Cotillard displays the lingering scent of depression in its most naked form,and gradually peels open a proud vitality in Sandra,over 2 days and 1 night.

Since the visceral despair of the excellent, yet hard to take Lorna's Silence, the Dardenne Brothers have been getting soft. The Kid With a Bike was, for me, dangerously close to maudlin. Two Days, One Night is a much better film than its predecessor, but it also finds the Dardennes in a more sentimental, accommodating mood. 

That isn't to say that its best qualities aren't outstanding. There's something quite unique about the way it builds great suspense through what is essentially a repeat of the same conversation between the protagonist and various supporting characters. 

If the Dardennes are often compared to Bresson, this film reminded me more of Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc, with the camera never far from the distraught face of its subject, studying every pained line and wrinkle, as if mercilessly empathetic. 

My problems with the film concern its last two minutes or so, which, if not quite a happy ending, seem sugar-coated- providing just a pinch too much closure. However the most distracting flaw, for me, was the casting of the glamorously beautiful movie-star Marion Cotillard as the factory-worker facing potential joblessness. I feel bad for saying that as Cotillard's performance is superb. But the Dardennes are known for naturalistic casting, and they apply that in every case in this film except for the lead. Indeed, Hollywood movies get a pass for casting beautiful stars as "regular folks" because the whole Hollywood aesthetic is to depict everyone as an idealized "type". Here, the actress's exceptional beauty just seems out of place, no matter how fine her acting may be.
