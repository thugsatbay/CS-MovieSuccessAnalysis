### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
****SPOILER ALERT******

Several reviewers have commented on physics representing logical certainty. In this movie, the opposite is true, and I believe that is the fulcrum upon which this modern story of Job rests. Modern physics strikes at the very heart of faith, mystery and law

The dybbuk! The husband is caught in the world of the material and cannot believe that the rabbi before him is a spirit, but his wife...she is not fooled! She believes that the world is filled with mysteries, and her faith in this leads to decisive action--saving them??

"Schroedinger's Cat" is a modern mystery, and it is the single subject that Larry is teaching in his physics class. "Bracket k bracket and it is equal," he says with finality, thinking that he has demonstrated the order of the world neatly. But "Schroedinger's Cat" is the ultimate expression of the rules of order, or G-d's work, leading off the cliff into the abyss of mystery.

In the example Schroedinger published in 1935, a cat is in a box with a "diabolical apparatus" which kills the cat if a random subatomic particle decays. Modern physics, being invented at the time, made the absurd prediction that until you opened the lid to check, the cat was in some sort of blurred probability space of being alive/dead, and it only became actually dead (or alive) when you opened the lid to check. Observation changed reality. The cat is in a mysterious state, beyond our comprehension or belief until we look. Do we have faith? Einstein didn't. He countered stating that "G-d doesn't play dice with the universe!" Schroedinger was doubtful, but insisted that the mystery was simply inescapable. This is the foundation for a rich allegory, indeed.

"I don't understand the mathematics, but I understand the stories," Larry's Korean student insists. "No, if you don't understand the math, you don't understand the physics. Even I sometimes don't understand the stories," Larry shoots back.

And in this lies the nub of the tale. Larry understands the rules--and follows them. His life is dreary and takes a seeming nose dive. Plague after plague arise and he is perplexed. One rabbi says "We all question the existence of hashem ("his name" = G-d) and then we see the wonder in...the parking lot." HE GETS IT!! For him it is faith. Even the friggin' parking lot is a divine miracle! The next rabbi weaves a deeply mystical tale with a banal ending. Larry is outraged. "What does it mean?" "How do I know. G-d does't owe us an explanation. The responsibility is the other way around," the rabbi responds. They each have their own understanding and advise. The young rabbi is not yet wise and advises faith. The next rabbi acknowledges mystery, but says it is beyond us to understand, so be a good person, "or a better person." "God doesn't owe us an explanation. The responsibility runs the other way."

It soon becomes clear that the Korean student and his father have a razor-sharp understanding of the "Schroedinger's Cat" story and thrust the paradox into Larry's life with a vengeance. If only Larry understood the paradox.

But he understands logic and rules. His faith is shaky, but he follows the rules. Sy doesn't believe a G-d is watching him, steals his friends wife, and G-d strikes him down in his path.

Even Larry's brother, believes in a crazy half-physics, half-Kaballah mystery and he actually wins card games with it, but he breaks the rules and is a pariah. 

The last rabbi will not even talk to him. The most direct response of G- d being questioned by a doubting subject.

At the end, Larry feels he is through his trial and "opens the box" to check to see if there is a G-d there. Surprise! There is! He opened the box by breaking the rules. The cat is dead. All his plagues had only been in some sort of blurred probability space of having happened/not happened; his marriage, his tenure the whole chain of events. It was not until he tested G-d by breaking a rule that the very real G-d of the bible smote him and his eldest son down. 

The original Job had actual punishments and kept his faith. Our modern Job has existential punishments and ends with a lack of faith. We must have faith, recognize the mysteries or obey the law according to our capacity, but to do none of these is an abomination.

My wife and I saw the film last Friday. We talked about it for an hour over dinner and again in the evening. The more we discussed it the better we liked it.

It helps to be familiar with the paradox of Schrodinger's cat, a staple of quantum physics, which can be found on Wikipedia, before you go see this film. You might also want to understand the quantum concept of duality.

The entire movie examines Gopnick and his world==and to a lesser extent that of his teenage son--in light of these aspects of quantum mechanics. I could not find a single scene that did not address uncertainty and/or duality. The attempt to discern traditional religious meaning in this world is humorous in itself. The opening presents the paradox and is crucial to the rest of the film.

Unlike the local review for the film which described this as a "typical Coen Brothers film" and "weird" and "no closure at the end", I found this film to be quite literal and true to the principles of uncertainty and duality. The two major characters both find closure, and in retrospect, there is clearly a beginning, middle and end to the story the brothers wanted to tell.

But the movie continues after the closure, just as life continues on a daily basis, setting up another expectation of continual uncertainty.

Not being Jewish, I no doubt missed some of the double entendre and humor in the tradition. I would have liked to understand the Hebrew passage of the bar mitzvah ceremony, for example, and how it relates to the core theme of the film. But the movie is universal in its appeal, if you understand the basic concept of quantum mechanics upon which the film is based.

I rate this as one of their best films due to its intellectual foundation. Much more important to me than No Country.

You may have to be a believer (Jewish or Christian) to like this film, although some secular (at least middle-aged midwestern) Jews and others may find it worthwhile for the period details. It is a modern version of the book of Job, which--of course you remember--contains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks, children, and health; a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses; a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters; the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind ('who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?'); a final submissive speech by Job ('I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye see thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes'); and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children (...) than he had before.

The book and the film address what (Christian, at least) theologians call theodicy, or how bad things can happen in the world when God, who supposedly controls everything, is supposedly good. For nonbelievers (if you have any interest in the subject), the best way to think of this is perhaps to ask yourself whether the universe (the Creation) is on balance a good thing ('and God saw that it was good'). If so, then perhaps we somehow have an obligation to live moral lives and (as Jews and Christians think of it) to follow God's law. If not, then perhaps it's every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost.

The Coens' answer, if I understand it correctly, comes out of the whirlwind at the end in the voice of Grace Slick. I personally prefer God's original response with its paean to astrophysics and evolutionary biology--'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ... Gave you wings and feathers unto the ostrich? Who leaves her eggs in the earth, and warms them in the dust, and forgets that the foot may crust them or that the wild best may break them...; because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding'--which essentially asserts that Creation is wonderful and a package deal. But the Coens' very different answer, while oddly Christian in emphasis, is fully consistent with both the 1960s zeitgeist and with the midwestern Jewish community that they have so meticulously recreated.

If you like this film, you really need to see it twice. But without giving anything away, if you see it once, be careful to pay attention to (i) the bribe that, like Schroedinger's cat, is alive and dead at the same time and (ii) the whirlwind at the end. This is a great film.

The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comedies/awkward tragedies that depict small-time people getting in way over their heads, who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way. 

"A Serious Man," however, is about a man who doesn't do anything, to whom bad/annoying things happen. This story of a confused suburban Jewish man in the '60s wrestling with life's meaning is therefore an important step in the evolution of the Coens' theme-driven film-making. Borrowing on an autobiographical context (Minnesota, Judaism, etc.) for the brothers, it moves on to greater cosmic questions but with the same quirky and ironic spirit that have garnered the Coens all their deserved attention over the last 20 years.

Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is that one Coen brothers character in every movie -- you know, the innocent one who manages to suffer a seemingly unfair fate (think Steve Buscemi in "The Big Lebowski" or most recently Richard Jenkins' character in "Burn After Reading") -- only he gets to pilot this film. In that spirit, an unknown Stuhlbarg is cast in the lead (although he was clearly up for the challenge). Larry is a mild-mannered math professor with a family in an ideal suburban home only his wife wants a divorce and his kids are nightmarish. Little by little the annoyances of his life pile up from the foreign student trying to bribe him for a passing grade while simultaneously suing him for defamation to his socially immature brother (Richard Kind) who won't leave his house.

Larry seeks answers from the rabbis in his community to understand the mess his life has suddenly become. One rabbi tells him he needs a change of perspective, another tells him the story of "The Goy's Teeth," a hilarious bit about a dentist who tries desperately to make meaning of a Hebrew message engraved in a patient's teeth only to find he was better off not worrying about it. None of their advice seems to help at the time -- but it's dead on. The Goy's Teeth scene in particular is one of the brilliant moments where the Coen brothers let you know pretty clearly what their intentions are with the film while giving you something to laugh about. That's their strength and it's all over "Serious Man."

Much like "Burn After Reading," this film is one that makes a thematic point out of the audience's attempt to squeeze meaning out of everything. By turning Larry into a Job-like figure to whom inexplicable misfortune happens, we're forced to put everything into perspective. When Kind's character, Arthur, has a tantrum in the middle of the night wondering why God has given him nothing and he points out that Larry has kids and a job, suddenly our perspective changes. Suddenly everything we thought mattered in this film and was of critical importance is really not such a big deal. Our desperate search for answers in both our lives and in this film, our tendency to over-analyze and derive reason from everything comes to a halt; the Coen bros. have worked their magic again.

"Serious Man" is one of their best in recent memory because it not only feels rooted and personal for them, but it moves toward a greater discussion of previously treaded upon themes and plots from their previous work. It is a challenging film and those who have struggled with the Coen brothers before will struggle again, but for the cerebral and intellectual moviegoer it's outstanding. 

The truth is, we don't have all the answers to make sense of life's events (or a story's plot points) and neither do the Coen brothers. One insignificant character in the film who appears to have an answer to just one of Larry's myriad of minor problems dies instantly with hysterical irony. Don't go into "A Serious Man" looking for answers, go into it looking for a change of perspective. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com

The only thing fairly remarkable or remotely intriguing about this film is the opening wherein a Yiddish-speaking Jew of the 19th century invites (accidentally) a dybbuk (evil spirit in the shape of a man) into his family home. The ominous turn of events and the wife's sensible solution to the situation is comical and you would think the film would build on such an interesting prologue.

Alas, like reading the Book of Job without the good parts (namely the philosophical arguments and the poetry, let alone a resolution), A Serious Man feels like an exercise in viewing torture. (What is it about 2009? The Road and A Serious Man both belong in the category of 'agonizing to watch...).

Maybe the brilliance of this film lies in that you think at any minute this honest, good, hard-working Jewish man will crack and finally take on the world that is besetting him as opposed to questioning G-d. But for much of the film, our lead character, Larry Gopnik, a professor, husband, father of two, brother of socially-inept Adam, there is little here that happens, let alone satisfies a viewing audience.

It has been awhile before I watched a film wherein I continually battled with myself over whether I should continue or simply walk away. I wanted to walk away...

What made this film the most unbearable is how each periphery character rarely ever showed their humanity - Larry's Son and Daughter are simply cretins, the former a typical high school student with bully problems and marijuana indulgence (also he orders records of the month and leaves the bill for his father) while his daughter's only needs in life seem to be her hair and going out. There is no dimension to either of them while their mother, Larry's wife is a loveless shrew that remarkably makes Larry pay for his rival's funeral, an arrogant friend of the family named Sy. Throughout the first half of the film, Sy and Larry's wife are in love, working on Larry to get a kosher divorce.

After awhile, I lost sympathy for the lead, not because of his wife and family, but because he had wandered into a cinematic world lacking humanity, let alone real people. The Coens have not crafted a movie, let alone a film but an alternate universe, a torture chamber of bland direction and characterization. It has been awhile since I watched a film where I felt I despised so many characters. Ideally, supporting characters are there to create relationships, to reveal the complexity of human life. It seems everyone here is just another means to stab the lead and bludgeon him with their inane presence. Even the rabbi who refuses to talk to him feels less like a person as opposed to a forced story development.

If you were the kid in school who didn't torture earth worms or pull butterfly wings off Monarchs, then you might not like this debacle, another pseudo-film from the Coen Brothers.

I suppose the first thing that needs to be said is that I'm not Jewish and, as such, a lot of what was obviously a deeply personal movie went over my head, and I was left feeling like an outsider, almost a voyeur.

However, perhaps as a result of this I'm able to view the film more objectively. Visually, it is beautiful. There are so many perfectly framed scenes that even when the story seems to drag it keeps you captivated.

Having said that, for me, it did drag. The central figure was a neurotic, cerebral, awkward, middle aged Jewish man. Not entirely a cinematic first. Add to this the fact that he was possibly the most passive character in cinematic history - he literally made no decisions in the entire movie until the final scene. Instead he was drawn from one catastrophe to another, on the basis that he was a good, upstanding man surrounded by stronger people.

Normally in this situation we would see the character challenged and grow, but this is the Coen brothers, so it's not going to be that simple. Instead,,we are left to squirm at the relentless nature of the man's incessant failings - a frustrating experience, particularly if you're not privy to the Jewish humour that pervades this intimate film.

It seemed to me almost as if the Coen Brothers were seeing how far they can stretch their high profile. With No Country For Old Men they robbed us of the pivotal, climactic scene and I for one left feeling cheated. Here they simply don't introduce it at all. They break every story paradigm there is, as if to suggest that they are now so great they can present a piece that has no development, no conclusion, a prologue that seems to have no relevance to the main body of the work, and no redemptive quality to extract from any of the characters. A bit like real life I suppose. But who wants to see that on a forty foot screen?

I need to lay down.

I can see why many people would dismiss this. Like the reviewer who watched "52 minutes" and turned it off because none of the characters were likable so it would be a waste of time to continue.

Those who expect life to be a series of plausible outcomes, logically following some kind of cause and effect order are always disappointed by honest works of art, not to mention life itself. One of the very themes of this film are those kinds of people and their need to cling to some sort of tradition, structure, and belief in order to deny their fear.

Another theme was perspective and perception. That what may seem mundane and meaningless may be filled with the most profound meaning and that which we place so much value in may be worth absolutely nothing.

"Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you."

If you can enjoy a movie that leaves you with questions as much as one that attempts to provide answers then I highly recommend a viewing.

A Serious Man (2009)

Such a vivid recreation of late 1960s suburban America is a remarkable enough basis for a movie, making the real meat of the thing almost transcendent. A joy! I recognized everything here from my own childhood--everything except everything Jewish.

And that's the point, taken well. And made well, brilliant from start to finish. Very Coen Brothers--moving, sometimes disturbing, and sometimes very hilarious.

For insiders--American Jews--the references and send-ups will be moving and funny and familiar. For outsiders--goys--A Serious Man is an indoctrination, a can opener to an ethnic world with deep roots (Eastern European in this case), great integrity, and many internal (modern) conflicts. 

The surrealism sprinkled throughout is just smart movie-making, keeping it from becoming a deep, ironic, and serious movie. It's a comedy with deeply serious undertones, not the other way around. Some of the acting is amazing, Michael Stuhlbarg playing the line between tragedy and farce in every scene, and the filming is expert without ever drawing attention to itself. The ending will leave many people talking and it isn't appropriate to do that here, except to say that in some ways it leaves you thinking so hard you may read more into the events than is really there.

Or not. Certainly the first scene, if it is some metaphor for all the follows, is both trenchant and disturbing, more Babel than Singer, but perhaps (perhaps) frightening in its misogyny. In fact, the whole movie has men who are wise, who laugh at their fate, who do good things, and women who, one way or another, stick the knife in you.

And who (or what) is the dybbuk here? Is this about the survival of some kind of Judaic history in contemporary America? Or is it larger, about the meaning of Judaism period, on a worldly level? Or larger still, is it simply a movie, like Do the Right Thing or My Big Fat Greek Wedding or any of thousands of others, about life, and love, and the struggling of one person against the woes of the world as he or she faces them, in their own context?

Or is it a comedy, a really funny comedy, making fun, having fun, and rising above the tawdry enough to remind everyone, Jewish or not, of the need we all have for community and connection and continuity.

I saw this movie at TIFF on Saturday. The Coens quietly (and I mean quietly - no-one could hear even their amplified voices) introduced the movie with reference to the actors present but not the movie, letting it speak for itself. And it did. In its own way. It is an off-beat (what else?) and serious work that radiates bleak despair while searching for a funny bone. In the process, the movie makes other black comedies look positively light and airy. The movie evokes laughs from a different place than most  from a profound discomfort watching people twist themselves this way and that to fit in and be regarded seriously, whether situationally, socially or religiously. A great piece of work that will have you thinking long afterwards, especially considering the odd and difficult-to-contextualize prologue and, um different, ending which bookend a remarkable work.

The Coen Brothers give to its frazzled protagonist Larry Gopnick a line a few times during the course of A Serious Man, "I didn't do anything!" that is more than just an homage to Franz Kafka - it's ripping him off basically. This is not to say Larry is quite in the same predicament of Joseph K. Then again, I wonder if Larry would prefer no explanation to the if-it-wasn't-for-bad-luck-I-would-have-no-luck status over the kinds he gets to his troubles. He has a divorce pending and his wife leaving with Sy Ableman (seriously, Sy Ableman!), he has a South Korean student who may be simultaneously bribing him and suing him for defamation, he has a brother who has a cyst/no job/gambling troubles, two kids who more or less are just typically dysfunctional teens (the boy on his way to be Bar Mitzvah and smoking enough dope to acknowledge more than once that it's 1967), and his sexual repression is practically taunted by the foxy Jewish woman next door who sunbathes nude. And what does God have to say about this? Oh, don't get him started on trips to the Rabbi - frankly, he'd have better luck with Anton Chigurh.

A Serious Man is a movie to take seriously as art, but at the same time the Coens aren't above pulling out their usual all-stops to make this a hilariously weird and awkward movie. Perhaps a better way to compare is that it's like if Curb Your Enthusiasm starred an average shmo who doesn't have quite the sense of humor of Larry David (and, perhaps, is even cursed by his bloodline via the opening scene in the movie... or maybe not, I'll get to that in a moment), and who keeps getting s*** on from all directions (not coincidentally perhaps Richard Kind appears in both show and movie). It's such a funny movie that I have to think back to Big Lebowski and O'Brother Where Art Thou to remember when I laughed so hard. Maybe its the predilection for Jewish jokes that sting so, or maybe its the originality with the storytelling. As far as a black-as-Jewish-death comedy, it works completely.

As for being a masterpiece of a film... I'm still not completely sure. Sometimes the Coens' movies are instant classics (No Country for Old Men, Blood Simple), and others take a little while to grow on a viewer (i.e. Miller's Crossing, even Big Lebowski was a grower and not a shower for me). A Serious Man may fall in the latter category; it's such a personal film, maybe more than anyone done before if only for the time and place and particulars of the characters in a Jewish-suburb of Minnesota, and its such an oddity in their catalog of work. Watching Larry on this existential odyssey of "WTF" nears Bergman proportions - there's even a scene where a character's death affects a woman in much the same way as the father Ekdahl's death in Fanny & Alexander - where religion is tested to the fullest and most harrowing of emotional schemes. Where is God when Larry needs him? Everywhere? Nowhere? Screw Larry, he didn't pay his (son's) Columbia Records account! 

But for all that succeeds in A Serious Man, such as a completely masterful sequence (a contender for my single favorite sequence of any movie this year) where a Rabbi describes a harrowing and pointless and uproarious story of a dentist and a Goy's teeth, or when Larry's son is stoned out of his mind when reading the Torah at his Bar Mitzvah (a first in cinema history, combining marijuana, Roger Deakins' use of a lens-baby, and Hebrew), and its creative characterizations and shocking nightmare scenes, it's an unsettling film, and not always in the best ways. It's a film that, as one could argue in their past films, is at war with if not the audience directly then with audience expectations. We might expect A Serious Man to just be about this man's downward spiral in his life, but what then to make of that (cool) opening scene all in Yiddish and (admitted by Joel Coen) to not really have a whole lot to do directly with the rest of the movie, or, for that matter, the end of the movie which just... ends.

As far as 'f***-you's' to audiences go, it certainly is funny and startling in comparison with No Country for Old Men (almost like the Coens are saying 'yeah, knock this one this time, we *dare* you!), and if I get an f-you from filmmakers I'm glad it comes from them. But... you will either need more than a viewing for it to sink in, or you'll curse the day you decided to walk in the theater or rent it. Not much of a middle ground. Then again, I wouldn't want it any other way in this case. And hey, it's got Jefferson Airplane quoted by a Yoda-Rabbi, that scores points right there! 9.5/10

Let me say up front that most fans of the Coen brothers' early films might be disappointed if they're expecting "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski" or even "O Brother". Unlike those movies, here we don't have a lot of plot, comedy or action. The message of the film is very challenging, and it requires a lot of thought to figure out what they're saying.

I'd say this movie is for fans of the recent American films "Synecdoche NY", "Doubt", and the recent Japanese films "Departures", "Yureru" and of course the classics by Kurosawa like "Rashomon". What I'm saying is that this is a film that tackles philosophical questions of perception, faith, and in particular, uncertainty.

If you've had some physics, you're in for a real treat because much of the theme centers around Schrödinger's "Uncertainty Principle", briefly touched upon in the Coens' excellent 2001 film "The Man Who Wasn't There". Here they give us a more powerful dose. If you've never heard of this principle, don't worry, you can look it up on Wikipedia or you can accept my synopsis of it, which I'll warn you might be flawed because I ain't no physicist:

The Uncertainty Principle (or "Schrödinger's Cat") proves mathematically that certain events are unknowable. It proposes the idea of a cat that might be alive or dead, but we cannot know without looking inside the cage. At the same time, the minute we look inside the cage, the cat will be killed by a toxic gas. The bottom line: we can't know the answer. Ever.

From there, the movie explores how different people react when confronted with the unknown. Some form prejudices. Some fall back on faith. Some become faithLESS. And some just don't care.

This is a beautifully crafted film that shows us the nature of human beings in that respect. No, there's not really a story. But it does even better than that: it challenges our minds to see elements of our own lives within the life of this ordinary schmuck. I am truly amazed at the Coens' accomplishment, and I hope they continue in this direction in the future, though I'm sure it may hurt their mainstream appeal.

If you see this film & like it, I think you'll really enjoy the other films I've listed as well as the Hungarian masterpiece "Werckmeister Harmonies", anything by Wim Wenders ("The End of Violence" touches on the same Uncertainty Principle) and Orson Welles' "The Trial".

This movie has only two things good: image quality and cultural accuracy. I am a high def constant viewer and i have to say the 1080p of this movie is one of the best i ever seen. Apart from this two highlights the "A Serious Man" has nothing to offer unless a big wast of time. I waited until the end to see a revelation or a critical turn over of the events because without that the movie is about nothing. The end is abrupt and it surprises you but that doesn't give it quality and it's cheap and easy. The movie is about the disgrace of a pathetic and stupid man that does nothing to change his sad life. That's it, nothing more nothing less. The good reviews you see out there are meant to claim an alternative movie and scream out loud: "I like this movie because i see beyond the banal viewer and only i can understand its depth." A good movie, or at least a watchable movie, needs to have personality, purpose and a message. This movie fails in all three and only successes on being annoying as hell.

One, you do not need to totally understand Judaism to get this film. Yes, the beginning of the film lays the groundwork that tells the viewer that any descendants of the Jewish couple who "killed" the Dybbuk is doomed to experience letdowns, but then again, maybe not. It is just a basic folktale, one from any religion or culture. Second, you do not need to understand physics either. Other than the passing of time seems to not pass at all while watching this film. After almost 40 minutes I had had it. Yes, a lot of %$&^ is dumped on this guy, and you wonder why he would deserve to be dumped on so much, but then you do not care. None of the characters were worth the time or effort. Maybe past the 40-minute mark it gets better, but alas I could not justify wasting my time to see what happened, and why. The acting was OK, but not worth the time to sit through this film, which might be better titled, A Pathetic Man.

The movie started out not bad, but for more than an hour nothing really happened. I just got very annoyed by the fact that the main character let everybody walk over him without even trying to stand up for himself.

Then in the end of the movie, the movie finally picks up some speed but suddenly it stops without any ending (good or bad). It's not even an open ending leaving you with some questions. It's like the movie just stops for a commercial break, but forgets to start again...

This movie is not the worst one I have ever seen, but I do regret staying up late to watch it.

I only watched this film due to the high rating here on IMDb as generally anything over 7 stars is decent.

I am not a religious person and perhaps that is why the film confused the hell out of me. Admitedly i was intrigued enough to watch it to the end. I was furiously annoyed with the ending and wished I hadn't wasted nearly 2 hours watching this "film" hence posting my review.

The acting isn't bad but seems one dimensional and there doesn't appear to be any depth of characters. You keep expecting the main character to go "postal" but does nothing of the sort.

As for being a Black Comedy I have watched many films of this genre and it barely made me give a wry smile at times. The true comedy is the Coen Brothers making a film that I watched to the end only to wish I hadn't bothered.

Knowing about the Jewish faith would probably improve your understanding of this film, however the only message an "Atheist" like my self can obtain is that if you are done wrong repeatedly that is doesn't make it OK to do something that is "unethical".

To sum up: Only worth watching if you are either religious or have nothing better to do for 2 hours of your life!

I guess the Coen brothers have gone back to making movies I don't like or understand. I've never been into their movies with the exception of the last two - No Country for Old Men and Burn After Reading, which I found brilliant. With this one, I came out of it with the thought "Wtf was this crap about?".

Maybe it's the Coen brothers or maybe it's the Jewish humor, but this movie reminded me of a sad sack dramatic version of Seinfeld, which I never got and also irritated me. The movie opened with a totally incongruent scene that would've been an interesting horror movie, and then went on to become the misadventures of one of the wimpiest guys ever seen on screen, and ended without a conclusion, or a point, for that matter. I hate such movies. 

The only redeeming factor I can think of is that the lead, Michael Stuhlbarg, was actually pretty good despite his role of one of the most annoying floor mats I've ever come across.

I still wonder why I have wasted my time on this movie, I mean this movie don't have a start and not an end neither. But most of all I am amazed that why this thing is nominated for Oscar!. I mean no doubt couple of performances are good but Man movie is nominated for best motion picture of the year. Best picture of the year !, are you kidding me!!!

I mean come'on boy there has to be some story to be nominated for Best screen play nomination. Because as long as I am concern there was certainly no story behind those scene which I just watched. Well better luck next Ethan Coen because I witnessed one of the great movies by you "NO country for old men" and I am hoping for that stuff again from your side. Final verdict, don't waste your time !

I just saw this film earlier today and I have to say that it was simply thrilling. Now how can I possible say that it was thrilling when there were zero action scenes, zero suspense, and zero plot? To me, it's exactly because it lacks those things that makes this film thrilling! If you are reading through these IMDb reviews, you already know the general premise of the movie and have likely seen the preview, and so knowing that it is a Coen brothers movie you probably know what kind of film to expect. 

One of the things I really love about this film (which others may hate) is because it basically has no plot, and is simply 90 minutes of one middle-aged man's struggles in life, with no type of resolution whatsoever. The tone and slow pacing of the film reminded me a great deal of the film "Sideways(2004)" in that we just see an average guy's struggles with the people in his life, with some comedic moments thrown in occasionally to break the overall depressing mood of the film. Like that film, you are so able to relate to the main character and his problems because his issues and the people he has issues with are so genuine.

And that's exactly why I call this review "a serious look at human nature." All of the great satire is in fact based closely on reality, or realistic events that we can relate to. In this film, the main character's issues are so average and normal (divorce, teenage son experimenting with pot, possible job advancement/work stability, etc.) that they are parts of almost everyone's everyday life. Even the interactions and subplots with the Asian student and the hunting neighbors are so very realistic, which aids in making them hilarious. Even if you are not Jewish, you will still be able to relate to and understand the satire in this film. Some moviegoers with short attention spans will probably hate this film and wonder when the big, explosive fight scene will be or when the Adam Sandler/Will Ferrell stupid fart/gay jokes will start appearing...but of course this film is the exact opposite of typical Hollywood.

Another reason why I am giving this film such a high score is because while watching this film it is clear just how much the Coen brothers simply LOVE making films, and they are only concerned with making the film their way. They don't care about box office profits or a target demographic...they just make films that are personal to them. It's just so refreshing to see. Just look at the attention to detail they will put into one scene of dialogue between characters. Look at the way the glasses' on someone's face are angled, the way the characters' hair is just a tiny bit messy, the way a character holds his yamaka in place while running, the way the lines are set-up and timed perfectly to have the perfect effect on the audience. When you watch this you can just see how dedicated they are to their craft. These guys care so much about creating little details and endearing characters and so little about any kind of recycled plot. Hats off to the Coen boys once again! Shalom!

What a LOUSY, Boring movie with absolutely no payoff at the end. There is NO WAY this is Best Picture material. I have to stop letting myself get suckered in by Oscar nominees. Another Focus picture reaching new lows of boredom (also did Lost in Translation, 21 grams, Burn after reading, Evening...)

There is nothing funny about this movie, I did not even crack a smile. It is not a drama since NONE of the characters have any cause there is no story purpose. The story is all over the place, yet it goes nowhere. Guy has trouble with students, wife wants a divorce, has uncomfortable relations with the neighbor, and he can not find the answers he wants from the Rabbis. Ohh and as a bonus...Richard Kind has a lousy role of a slump cousin with some giant back pimple or something.

I guess the Coen bros were trying to score points with Jewish community, which is VERY powerful in the movie industry. Man...you can not just like a movie because it is Jewish... it should still be good!

You wanna watch a good Jewish movie...rent Lost in Yonkers, Biloxi Blues, The Pianist, Life is Beautiful, or anything from Adam Sandler is better than this!

Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love" hovers over the scenes of the Coen brothers' A Serous Man, the story of a Sixties Minnesota Jewish college professor with a small family whose life starts to fall apart. One of the Coens' strangest and most thought-provoking films, this one is a black comedy, a meditation on Jewishness, and a modern rethinking of the Book of Job in a world where "Hashem" (God) isn't just incomprehensible but largely imperceptible. The movie has been seen as a mean-spirited product of self-hating Jews, but that's not right at all. Returning to their roots and their tribe, the Coens have never been more serious or, in their sardonic way, more kind. To see life as a cosmic joke is really quite orthodox. It just doesn't lend itself to easy answers. And the rabbis the professor consults haven't got any. They've got, basically, nothing.

The time and place echo the Coens' own youth. One of them might have been preparing for his Bar Mitzvah like Danny Gopnik (Aaron Wolff), the son of the film's nerdy but utterly decent physics teacher hero, Larry Gopnik (the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg).

'A Serious Man' begins with a little Yiddish prologue set in long-ago shtetl Poland when a wife stabs an old man who's done a good deed for her husband because she thinks he's a dybbuk, a dead person possessed by an evil spirit. (The sequence is serious and gentle, in the manner of the Yiddish theater, and not a joke.) When the old man starts to bleed and wanders out into the snow, the couple realizes they've brought on terrible luck.

Terrible luck: that's what is visited upon Larry Gopnik. But first we see Danny listening to Sixties rock with an earpiece hooked to his transistor, in Hebrew class. The old teacher confiscates the little radio, and tucked into its case $20 the boy owes somebody.

All the scenes are marked by the Coens' usual precision and elegance but the movie is tricky to watch because it changes focus so rapidly. It alternates between offhand polyphonic passages in which four things are going on at once to super-focused ones where only one very intense thing is happening; it asks us to laugh and be cynical but demands metaphysical speculation.

The point is Larry has all this stuff going on at once: his wife (the implacable Sari Lennick) is leaving him, inexplicably, for the titular "serious man," the unctuous, self-satisfied Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a widower who's wife died only three years ago. His hugs and reassurances of the value of communication show the feel-good clichés of the period used as a cynical ruse. At work, there's a Korean student Clive Park (David Kang) who tries to bribe Larry to change his F to a passing grade, and when Larry refuses, Clive's father threatens a lawsuit. The goy neighbors are vaguely menacing: they're infringing on Larry's property line. He's up for tenure, and somebody's sent the tenure committee letters impugning his morals. His useless brother Arthur, jobless and with a gambling problem, has come for refuge, and is sleeping in the living room. Larry's wife exiles them both to the Jolly Roger Motel. A "sophisticated" woman neighbor (Jewish, Amy Landecker) who sunbathes in the nude, tempts Larry to "take advantage of the new freedoms." Meanwhile there's a daily pinprick that may morph into a serious threat: calls keep coming to the department office to say Larry owes money to a record club he never joined.

The children are simply not there. Danny is only interested in marijuana -- he goes through his Bar Mitzvah (almost as memorable a one as in Schlesinger's 'Sunday Bloody Sunday') entirely stoned -- along with getting better reception to watch a certain TV show, and rock music. (He learns his Torah passage nonetheless.) Danny's older sister goes to a club every day and is only interested in washing her hair.

But all this is incidental, because as the formal inter-titles indicate, the central moments are Larry's attempts to consult with rabbis who will help him. But they're no help. "I, too, have forgotten how to see him in the world," says one (Simon Helberg), with a non-Jewish name, who cites the parking lot as a vision of the wonders of creation. A higher-level rabbi(George Wyner), sipping tea, says, "Something like this, it's never a good time." The oldest, putatively wisest rabbi, Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), won't see him at all. He sees Danny after his Bar Mitzvah, returns his transistor radio to him, and quotes Jefferson Airplane.

Central to 'A Serious Man' is Jewishness -- true to the Coens' own origins: they grew up in a heavily Jewish neighborhood, where you went to the synagogue and got Bar Mitzvahed. You became a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer: and each of these professions comes in for an appearance, and Larry's various troubles leads him to more than one lawyer, with threatening bills -- it's a nightmare! -- but it's also steeped in mundane quotidian Jewish experience. The Coens' irony has applied to being Minnesotan in 'Fargo,' to being laid back in 'Big Lebowski.' But being Jewish is a good sight more central to their comic world-view. What are the Jews? The Chosen People. Chosen for what? The Holocaust? Every memory of Jewish pride is matched by a twin memory of humiliation and rejection. None of the people around Larry closest to him are any real help. But he remains a good man. He remains nerdy, but he's still admirable.

In making Larry Gopnik, the humble schlep (a smart mathematician but a dumkopf when it comes to people) into a Job, they redeem him, and they take the torments of man in a world where God can't be located accessible to us and to their humor. Does Jewish experience make the torments of the modern secular world any more comprehensible? Maybe not; but it's what they've got to work with.

Well what can I say, I have pretty much seen everything the Coen brothers have done and I have to say I'm not a huge fan of their work, I think they have good ideas but have trouble transferring them onto screen.

When I first heard about "A Serious Man" I was looking forward to seeing if they were going to change my mind, they most definitely did not. The fact that this film is over 7 on IMDb is a disgrace! and should have never been nominated for any type of award. This is not the worst film but their is nothing that separates it from hundreds of other films of the same nature. I watched just over an hour hoping it would start taking direction but it just didn't! other then their being some solid acting the storyline was about as interesting as watching cricket! "and I'm Aussie ha ha"

Many reviewers had labeled this "audacious" and also "hilarious" I watched this for over an hour and I think I got one or two laughs out of it, totally not worth the time. I don't see how people got dark/comedy from this film. A satire or dark comedy would be "Ghost World" or "American Psycho" not this film. I think it was just a straight up drama that never amounted to anything, incredibly slow and lacking in character development, the first ten minutes set the tone for this entire movie. I'll never get my time back I advise you move three isles over at the DVD store when you see this one!

i love this film. if you had asked me if i loved it after the first viewing, i would have replied that i don't know. i didn't understand it for a few viewings, and even after 10+ viewings, i still don't understand it totally, but i embrace the mystery...

there are so many levels to this film. many of the previous reviewers focused on the book of Job retelling, but i feel that is just one of many levels of this film. there are societal levels, generational levels, emotional levels, and mathematical levels, just to name a few that I've uncovered. every little scene of this movie appeals to one of the interpretations of the same story. Larry represents at once, his own mid-life self and his future son. the son, while appearing flat and devoid of substantive character, is Larry also. the first two rabbis represent Larry and son, middle age rationality and youthful wonder, and Marshak represents the wisdom of old age. even the confiscation of the radio by the teacher is a metaphor for middle age stealing the freedom of youth. the bar mitzbah scene (sorry for any misspellings, as i am not Jewish) is quite telling. the rabbi literally forces the boy to pull the cup from his hands, symbolizing how we must take from society (the generation before us) what we deserve. the boy learned the Torah and had difficulty speaking his verses, and some of the older men around him provided assistance. previously, when the boy offered assistance to the old teacher in using his radio earphones, it was dismissed, but later in the movie, Marshak recites verses of Jefferson Airplane for the boy and accepts his assistance. this signifies something about how the wise realize that youth have more to offer the world than just their stupid and repetitive nonsense. the boy went to the trouble of learning Torah, so Marshak reciprocates because he is wise enough to see the beautiful contributions of youth to society (ie. the song which in essence tells more about what is happening in the movie than the rabbis do). the middle aged rabbi is nearly worthless, as he speaks only in rational things. the youngest rabbi speaks truth, but his truth cannot appeal to the middle aged Larry, except when he is high and sees things with a new perspective.

as for the beginning sequence, we must accept that evil is real and irrational. the middle aged man (who is rational) cannot accept the idea that the man who helped him is in fact evil. its irrational to think this could be possible. the scene was left open ended because we must decide for ourselves which is reality. did the wife kill a dybbuk or not? she believes that she did because she is irrational and religious. to believe in God, is essentially a leap of faith. you must forgo the rational and do what you are told is correct. Dora acts, regardless of the outcome, because she believes in the irrational. i believe she killed a dybbuk. later in the movie, Sy Ableman is the dybbuk in Larry's life and he doesn't act because he is rational. he is rational because he is middle aged and beset by tribulations, unable to deal with them as his son does (avoiding them). he must be irrational and yet he cannot.

the final sequence with the tornado ties all the levels of the movie together. the son is both himself and a future Larry at once. i don't believe the tornado represents an actual impending death for him, but rather the storm of middle age that he will inherit from his father. we are left to decide if Larry will live or die, be terminally ill or just suffer further tribulations, but either way, his son will no longer be able to run away from his own tribulations. he will become his father, thus he better find somebody to love. that was what Larry needed to help him through his own perils.

all in all, this movie is pure brilliance. i would suggest watching it at least 3 times and trying to see it from a different angle with each viewing. pay attention to the small story details and see the puzzle in its pieces. you can assemble A Serious Man in many different ways and find a unique commentary in each viewing. all of the meanings and symbols exist together simultaneously. its an abstract cinematic masterpiece that should not be viewed as a realist painting, but taken in for the beauty of each of its various and seemingly unrelated parts.

Misfortunes befall a Jewish physics professor in 1967 Minnesota: his wife is dating a family friend and wants a divorce, his two teenage children are self-centered and unsympathetic, his brother (living with the family) is a nuisance and an embarrassment, one of his students has attempted to bribe him for a better grade...even his neighbors--animal-killing Goyum!--are giving him a rough time. Richly-textured dark comedy by the sometimes-inscrutable Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, who teamed on the writing, producing and directing, begins with a strange, amusing Yiddish prologue in pre-WWII Eastern Europe that sets the tone for the quizzical, deadpan-eccentric situations that follow. In the lead, Michael Stuhlbarg initially projects a wonderful, grounded screen presence, a combination of a logical perspective and a dryly incredulous resolve; however, the Coens come to rely too much on Stuhlbarg's nebbish qualities, such as his unwavering patience in the midst of outlandish circumstances. Stuhlbarg's crinkled, happy/sad eyes and his nervous, tightly-stretched little smiles also remind one too much of a younger Robin Williams, and the performance begins to look like an impersonation. The art direction and set design is a dream, showcasing the Coens penchant for brilliant scene-composition and execution, but their tale--an ironic tragicomedy about morals and fate and the "expressions of life"--won't be to everyone's taste. Ultimately, the film offers a handful of audacious moments in search of a masterwork. **1/2 from ****

I don't like social movies and they are so boring . After watching this movie that I shouldn't watch social movies . Why serious ? I hoped that it will be some comedy and that there will be so many laughs but I am disappointed . Maybe cinemas made mistake and wrote that it is some kind of comedy . Why curious ? It is movie about Jews and I didn't understand half of the expressions . Movie is so unconnected and black but I finally understood that it is dramatic growing up of Danny in some curious family. Why boring ? There is no enjoyment and how it can be . The first scene is the strangest thing in movie . What was the point of watching some Jews or I don't know who in their houses and they are having some boring conversation . Maybe you can only smile because of the chaos in Gopnik family . I am respecting directors but I maybe don't like social movies and I am not so merciful . Movie is made very well but I don't like it.

'A Serious Man', I didn't have any clue about this film before I saw that it was nominated for best picture in the Oscars this year. So, I had to see what was so special about the movie, directed by the Coen Brothers. The opening scene with the period setting is what drew me in.

This is a black comedy which revolves around Lawrence Gopnik's (Larry) life as he watches his life begin to unravel through various incidents. His wife is leaving him for another man - Sy Ableman who is a recent widower while emptying him of all his savings, his son is into drugs (he doesn't know that), the daughter doesn't go to school, his brother is living on his couch, he is being bribed by a Chinese student to pass him, and he seems to have been enamoured by his neighbourhood lady who's husband is out of town all the time. All of this while seeking answers in a spiritual way, when physics didn't have an answer for him. There are three different rabbi's in Larry's life and each one of them have a different view on his life.

I am not a jew to actually relate to the characters and also this is my second Coen brothers movie after Burn After Reading (which I liked). So, I don't know what all the fuss is about the Coen brothers and I am definitely not a fan (maybe not yet?). The opening is what held my attention. A rabbi helps a man with his cart or something in the middle of the night and apparently he knows the man's wife. So, the man invites him over for soup(!! I guess it is the time period). The wife tells the man that the rabbi had been dead for the past three years and the thing that is sitting in their living room is a dybukk, but the man, being a believer in science and physics, doesn't believe in spirits and conveys the same to his wife. The rabbi was speaking so normally, dressed normally and even had a solid body, how could he believe her? No sane person would. So, the wife puts a knife into the rabbi's heart, upon which the rabbi just laughs and goes out of the home into the heavy snowfall. That scene was very powerful. I just loved it. It shows that even though we live in an age of science where everything can be explained rationally, there are some things which can be the work of the gods and we can't really do anything about it. I thought that they would expand on the spirits plot, but they took it in a different direction.

After that, the movie jumps into Larry's class where he is explaining the Schrodinger's cat paradox. Is the cat alive? Modern physics made an absurd prediction that one can never know until the box is opened and the cat could have lived inside the box in a mysterious time or state, until you opened the box. All of this is relevant with the proceedings of Larry's life. Some have said the story leaves you hanging at the end, there is no closure. But, the film began with a day in Larry's boring life and when it ends, life must continue for Larry. This was just a brief view of his life. I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone as some may get bored. Still, it was an intriguing drama, with some black comedy thrown in.
