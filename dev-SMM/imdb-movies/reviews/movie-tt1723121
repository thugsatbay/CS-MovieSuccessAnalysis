### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
There's nothing to it, if all you're looking for witty/clever/subtle/deep humor, and you hate sexual/stupid/slapsticky type humor...you will probably still like We're The Millers.

It's not a gold mine of comedy by any means, but it did the job it told us it would do: Make us laugh and give us a fun ride. They really brought together a dysfunctional family and did it in a way that allowed for some suspension of disbelief. A lot of comedies nowadays have those hit or miss scenes where you either laugh, or you just can't suspend your disbelief and you're sitting there like "Really? Really? She's gonna poop in the sink?" (guess the reference). We're The Millers is pretty much a compilation of those kinds of scenes that hit just the right tone to pull it off as funny, clever and it just kinda grows on you. 

The "family" we see on screen for most of the surprisingly high 109 minute runtime is in a lot of ways funny, in some ways disgusting, and in a few ways charming. The film just works with the pairing of Sudeikis and Aniston, as we saw for a tiny bit in Horrible Bosses, which to me is one of the funniest movies in a long while. If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. The film was consistently funny in a sense that when it got me, it REEALLLY got me.

Overall, the film is just a slight bit lovable, with characters you actually kinda like...not too common for a modern comedy. More so than the story, the laughs came interspersed well enough to where I can't complain because I did way more laughing than I expected. It wasn't "rolling on the floor" funny, but I did have some hearty laughs out loud.

Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous works by the screenwriters.

7/10

EDIT: I ended up seeing it a second time and tried to pay attention to all of the funny subtlety of one-liners and witty remarks by characters throughout, and I laughed very hard at quite a few things I didn't catch the first time. I liked it more the second time and raise my rating to an 8/10. Is truly a very funny film.

I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does not disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will Poulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie.

I have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I laughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time pass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will Poulter very well. 

I recommend the film to everyone, not only comedy lovers (I'm surely not one of those).

Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny "real" movie. Starts and ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do it!

We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some of those "stupid", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are just the perfect "family". They picked just the right people for this comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh!

Its supposed to be a funny summer movie and it is. It delivers laugh out loud jokes with lots of sexual undertones and overtones. The story- line is set up for an off beat road movie; pick up a smidge of Mary Jane South of the border, down Mexico way and return it to Denver to pay off a debt to the drug dealer. Jason Sedakis is the drug dealer. He assembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off they go to Mexico. Jennifer Anniston plays a stripper, recruited to be the mom, and of course, she ends up in various situations wearing skimpy costumes and making penis jokes. What more could you possibly want?The other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl. Both of them are hilarious for different reasons, the nebbish kid is sincere, honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug dealers schemes. Tension is added to the film by the appearance of a drug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold to the wrong dealer and a DEA Agent and family that the Millers happen to befriend.

I came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and might I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run a job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look suspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift "family" with three people he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl runaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV. Hilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and predicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad guys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they get the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying them on their trip.

90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie. It was fairly funny from start to finish, and the main cast works well together. I think this was a great idea for a movie! *** out of ****

It's amazing to think that nine years ago, director Rawson Marshall Thurber surprised everyone with making a hit film about the sport of dodgeball with the Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller vehicle Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Since then, he hasn't done much worth writing home about until now with the hilarious comedy We're the Millers.

David (Jason Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who sells little bits to anyone and uses that as his source of income. Rose (Jennifer Aniston) is a stripper who isn't living an ideal life. They know each other from living in the same apartment building. David and Rose are checking their mail at the same time and as David tries to make conversation, Rose rudely pushes him away. David is later talking to another neighbor, Kenny (Will Poulter), as they notice a young girl (Emma Roberts) being harassed by three older guys who refuse to return her phone. David and Kenny find themselves in a compromising situation where their lives are threatened. As they make a run for it, the bullies chase them down and steal David's backpack that had some important possessions. The next day, David is called by his boss Brad (Ed Helms), who forces him into a job that involves David going to Mexico to retrieve some drugs and bringing them back by Sunday night for $100,000. While talking to Kenny, a dorky family in an RV pulls up to ask directions to the zoo. Even though David is rude to the family, he gets the idea to have a pretend family so they are not suspected. Kenny think of himself as David's friend and is on board. They see Casey (Roberts) around and David hires her to pretend to be his daughter. David then tries to hire Rose to be his pretend wife during the job, who rejects his offer. In order to pull of the look, David shaves his face and gets a token white father hair cut and gives Casey money to pull off looking like a regular daughter and thinks Kenny already looks right for the part. After being evicted from her home, Rose agrees to David's offer. For the remainder of the film, David, Rose, Kenny, and Casey have to act like a family so nobody is suspicious, and through it all, start to be a real family to each other.

The film is hilarious and doesn't stop having good jokes, thanks to a script written by Bob Fisher, Steve Faber, Sean Anders, and John Morris. They do a great job of keeping the script funny and raunchy. Yet there are parts in the film where the script is a sense of too many cooks in the kitchen. There are a couple of scenes that are over the top. However, the writers all do great at giving the actors their chance to show what they can do with the parts that were written.

From an acting standpoint, this is mostly Jason Sudeikis's show. Sudeikis gives a great character arc of David as a drug dealer who lives for only himself but turns into a guy who proves that he cares about others. Jennifer Aniston is a riot as Rose, a stripper with a heart of gold who learns from others about how to care for other people. Will Poulter is hilarious as Kenny, who is a good kid that needs guidance. Emma Roberts is also fun as the runaway teen who also needs guidance from others and is quick to say the right thing to make the "Miller" situation work in their favor. Ed Helms had played jerks before and shows why he is good at here as the blackmailing boss. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are also fun and a bit over the top in their roles as a couple who the Millers run into on the way back home.

Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good job as director and keeps the film running smooth. He does great with handling his cast ensemble and guides them to having their moments at acting and being funny. He also does great with making the over the top moments funny and work with the film.

The smalltime drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed by a gang while helping his nerd teenage neighbor Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter) in an assault. David has to pay a large amount to his supplier Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms ) that offers a chance to David to quit his debt and raise some money. David should smuggler a large shipment of marijuana in Brad's nickname of Pablo Chacon from Mexico to him. 

David offers some money to the stripper Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston) and to the juvenile delinquent Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts) and invites Kenny to travel with him posing as the Miller family on vacation in an RV to not call the attention of the authorities. After a couple of incidents in Mexico, they befriend the Fitzgerald family that is traveling on vacation in an RV and they cross the border back to the USA. Soon they discover that Don Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman) is a DEA agent and David leans that he was lured by Brad and the real Pablo Chacon (Tomer Sisley), who owns the shipment, is chasing them with his right-arm. 

"We're the Millers" is a politically incorrect comedy that made my Saturday better with many laughs. The story is very funny and most of the situations are hilarious. The conclusion is very well resolved. For those that have not seen this movie yet, watch the credits that there is a joke with Jennifer "Rachel" Aniston. My vote is eight.

Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper in this movie. I think that's all that needs to be said here.

We're The Millers follows local pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) after unfortunate circumstances lead his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to have him transport a giant shipment of weed from Mexico into the U.S. To do this, David assembles a fake family bearing the last name Miller to cross the border without suspicion. This family consists of Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who lives in David's apartment block, Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter), David's dorky neighbor, and Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts), the local "gutter punk".

While this particular story may be original, the way the movie plays out is completely cliché. When watching the movie you're going to be able to tell what's gonna happen next as far as the progression of emotion between the characters. The classic at first they don't get along, then they start to have fun, then they find out something about one of the characters that upsets them, yada yada yada. You know the drill. But I'm very lenient with comedies because they have one job: to make me laugh and We're The Millers, for the most part, does its job successfully.

This is a very dumb comedy. There is no joke that takes any thought to figure out, but the movie never seems full of itself. It's very self aware and doesn't try to be something it's not. That being said, I don't know if I would have liked the movie as much if it wasn't for the cast, particularly Sudeikis and Poulter. Sudeikis just has a natural charm to him and he delivers lines that aren't actually that great in ways that make them funny (Also he's engaged to Olivia Wilde, so good on him). Poulter has the perfect face for this role. I almost feel bad for saying it but his character was hilarious just because he's such a dorky looking guy. Aniston and Roberts do what they can with what they're given in the script but neither of them really did anything that stood out to me (Except for a scene that was actually rather uncomfortable after Kenny attempts to flirt with a girl). Also, Nick Offerman is in the movie for a little bit and has a really awesome scene involving a mug. None of the other actors really do anything worth mentioning, which sucks because Ed Helms is in this movie and nothing with him made me laugh due to the unfortunately weak script. Really it's the actors that made this movie likable, and the fact that the b-reel during the credits of the movie is funnier than most of the actual movie backs that up. 

What you see in the trailer for the movie is basically exactly what you get: A pretty enjoyable comedy, although nothing remarkable. Speaking of the trailer, it actually gives a lot of the best laughs away (as most trailers do) so if you haven't seen it or you don't really remember it, don't watch it! This Is The End still reigns champion as this year's best comedy, but I'd say We're The Millers is good in its own right.

In "We're the Millers," the protagonists' gradual adjustment to the notion of family, their subsequent individual dismissals, and the final change of heart from the patriarch is far from unpredictable. But the foul-mouthed dialogue and bawdy predicaments inserted at nearly uninterrupted intervals leaves the journey with rarely a dull moment. The gags are at their peak when suffused with innuendo without falling into vulgarity and the lighthearted mockery of drugs, relationships, and modern youth garners giggles despite the serious nature of the titular clan's beleaguered situation. Leads Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston are no strangers to the genre and they're in fine form here; the diverse assortment of supporting characters also complement the stars' strengths while delivering their own share of memorable lines, proving that crude anatomy jokes aren't the only way to get a laugh. But those are in here too.

When longtime pot dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of his cash and his goods, his scheming supplier Brad (Ed Helms) presents him with a deceptively simple proposition as recompense  travel to Mexico and smuggle a small shipment of marijuana back across the U.S. border. Surmising that families on vacation won't raise any eyebrows from the authorities, David gathers together Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a stripper in need of money, Kenny (Will Poulter), a naïve, neglected loner, and runaway teen Casey (Emma Roberts) to portray his fabricated "Miller Family." But when David discovers Brad lied about the quantity and the true ownership of the weed, the Millers find themselves on the run from both the authorities and crazed drug lord Pablo Chacon (Tomer Sisley)  forcing the makeshift band of misfits to work together as a real family in order to survive.

It might be the flimsiest establishment of a competently hilarious premise ever conceived - but this has become the parameter of nearly every raunchy comedy of late. In order to develop a dilemma, sinister scenarios are met with insincere, informal circumstances. Even less concern is given to the resolutions. "This is way out of my league," states David about smuggling tons of drugs out of Mexico  moments after sticking his nose in other people's business, failing to be the hero he thinks he should be, momentarily fleeing from a young thug with a knife (apparently drug dealers don't carry weapons of their own), and finally being dragged back to his apartment and robbed of all of his product and savings. Since none of his character development is devoted to modeling a believable dealer, it's silly to think any of his later plights would be treated with realism  especially when guns are waved in his face and family members threatened with execution.

Not every situation is as lazy; Rose is forced to devise a "weed baby" from a towel and a wrapped brick of marijuana, resulting in immensely funny scenes of panic, chaos, and creative circumvention of ruin. While attempting to resemble a household, the roles and expectations of each member are examined with a witty apperception, mistaken identities, and accidental complications, along with the critical judgment of professions and varying notions of success. Instead of crafting uncomfortable sketches, well-intentioned awkwardness is unintentionally perceived as perverse, allowing for greater comedic suspense and anticipation. There are a handful of truly laugh-out-loud moments, making use of spontaneous, sarcastic, clever dialogue. Despite the generic yet amusing love story, unimpressive antagonists, and randomly inserted stripping scene (to show how proud Aniston is of her body, at 44), "We're the Millers" takes the dysfunctional family routine to a new level, skewing convention and mocking normality, resulting in a surprisingly solid comedy.

This movie had me in fits of laughter. I love Jennifer Aniston. She played Joanna in my favourite movie of all time, Mike Judge's, 'Office Space'.

The movie is fast paced and there's not a boring moment throughout it. The story line is straight forward and so you don't have to spend much time thinking too hard. You get to sit back and laugh for 110 minutes which is really great.

There are some really funny lines in the movie and my favourite one of all which had me in fits of laughter was, 'You can buy a house and run away from it' (this will only make sense within the context of the movie).

Highly recommended if you want to relieve some stress after a hard day at work.

Normally I stay away from drug related films, as I don't understand it all too much. But seeing as the film had Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston in, I thought I'd give it ago. I was surprised to say the least, and impressed because it wasn't what I thought. Will Poulter created a perfect socially awkward Kenny Miller and Jason Sudeikis really kicked it up a gear. I found it hilarious from start to finish, as the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer. It was honestly a great movie, and I found myself laughing 85% of the time, with a great cast but simple enough storyline, the film delivered on many levels. Must see movie, even if you just watch Jennifer Aniston.

This movie had a lot of very great actors and actresses who is so funny I almost laughed my a*s off #SPOILERALERT I personally think the funniest moment was in the wan when they listened to "waterfalls" and Kenny ("Will Poutler") rap along with the music #SPOILEROVER. This movie is defiantly one I can watch again and again. Take my advice and watch it if you haven't already watched it. "Jennifer Aniston" showed some really great and funny acting with the whole (maybe #SPOILERALERT) striper thing (#SPOILEROVER) and the whole concept of the movie is just plane genius the way it takes all these different kind off problems and just stack them on top of each other is awesome. This movie is kind of in that category that can't be said or written with words you know (hopefully). I think that this movie is something you shouldn't live without haven't seen (Hope i'm not being to dramatic) so see it. Have A Good Time Watching This Movie Says Ida<3.

Definitely a film which belongs under the must watch section. so funny had me in stitches its witty,clever, funny, excitable. if you love comedy films then this is just the film for you. A well matched / unmatched family forced to do something to keep their heads a float. Great name for a great film. Seen this so many times now.Just cant stop watching it. It has just become one of my favourite films of all time. Perfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature in this film. anything with Jennifer Aniston is worth a watch in my eyes even if it was rubbish which it wasn't. 10 out of 10 from me. as previously described 'so dumb yet so funny' i agree completely. you will be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film. its a bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier.

We're the Millers (2013)

Okay, this seems like just another goofy comedy, but it's pretty great. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. But more than that, it creates a kind of intimacy and sense of real family (a sense of it) that makes you realize what family is all about. Yeah, unlikely, I know, but it works. When the two "fake" parents start to act like real ones, it's funny but also moving. 

Who woulda thought?

It's hard to say who pulls this offclearly the "parents" are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. And the two kids are pretty good too, if clichéd. But what makes it all happen is the breezy comic writing. The basic set up is filled with clichés, and you have to like corny humor to really enjoy the play on these. So there are drug lords and immigrations officials. There are dorky RV tourists and clueless bystanders everywhere. But kick back and don't' expect too much and be surprised.

And don't miss the bloopers in the final credits. Among them is a great moment where they play the theme to "Friends" on the RV radio, and it seems to catch Aniston by surprise. Group admiration.

This movie was hilarious.. Me and my fiancé think it is a great family movie especially if you like to smile and giggle a little bit. It has a weird twist to it but it is very funny. I think every one should watch this movie. Give it a shot and watch it, It will definitely make you cackle. Hope you like it as much as we did. Me and my boyfriend look for movies on IMDb.com that are rated but we both like romantic comedies. So, The true love stories are my favorites. This movie is kind of a weird way to say you begin to love someone but it is totally worth the watch or at least that is what I would say. So, Don't wait a minute longer watch this movie and see what you think of it.

I absolutely fell in love with this movie simply because it's nowhere close the movies you usually see in the cinema. I payed for the movie expecting the usual family story with a couple of fun scenes. I hadn't read the summary so I had no idea what it was all about. To say the truth, I was pleasantly surprised. The actors definitely fit the people they are playing and it's really beautiful. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll speak in general. The story line is something outstanding. It is so unbelievably crazy that it sucks you right in. It's something that shows you a totally different kind of life.Something crazy.Something extreme. And all that happening in a family van. It reminds me of Bethoven. No, not the composer-the movie.Only instead of a dog they were loaded with drugs. Some of these stuff are were so insane... so disturbing.It really drives your humor up a notch testing how uncomfortable you can get while still finding it hilarious. Me?- I found it hysterical.

It really refreshes your sense of humor and makes you forget all about the burdens of life. I definitely don't "ragret" watching it.

For all Jennifer Aniston fans out there, here is an amazing comedy drama movie with a great storyline. The direction is amazing as it character development is at a proper pace. A drug dealer makes a fake family to transfer drugs from Mexico all the way to his hometown. It is one of those movies which make you feel delighted. For people who loved FRIENDS, there is a surprise at the end of movie. But do watch the whole movie before jumping to the end. It is amazing to see that Jennifer Aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous. It is one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she plays a leading role unlike Horrible Bosses.

After watching the trailers I thought it's just gonna be a forgettable, try-hard and cliché movie. I never thought I'd watch it but my friends were raving about it so I thought I'd give it a go.

Boy was I wrong! I LOVED it: it was fresh, engaging,sweet without being schmaltzy and genuinely funny. Often I was laughing out loud like at the weed baby and Will Poulter rapping "Waterfalls". Jason Sudiekis, Jenifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter all acted wonderfully and their chemistry was key in this movies awesomeness. I just loved the warmth of the family bonding and the romance seemed natural and not forced. Don't listen to critics or trailers and watch this great movie to see what I mean!!

I never miss a film which involves the magnificent and beautiful as well as talented Jennifer Aniston! I've seen all her films from Leprechaun (1993) to the present and I sure was never going to miss this belter of a film!

We have Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - who is the leader of the "family" who has to enter Mexico to pick up drugs for a wannabe drug lord played by Ed Helms. I laughed so hard when he jumped off the balcony and landed on top of the bin instead of in it.

If you really like/love Jennifer Aniston for her role as Rachel Green on FRIENDS and her other film appearances, you will really love her more in this film! Jennifer Aniston plays Rose O'Reilly - a sexy stripper - whose maternal instincts kick in when she finds a friend in Casey Mathis who is played by Emma Roberts. Personally, I really loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer Aniston who looks as hot as ever and IN MY OPINION, she is the epitome of beauty in my eyes. As the years go on, her beauty is undeniably flawless! Also, I loved the scene in the back of the plane when she prays with the "family".

We have Emma Roberts as an angry teen - known as Casey Mathis - with a big mouth. I really liked her performance in the film as she really bounced off the characters of Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. My favourite scene involving her is when she is hugged by Kenny and she fiercely tells him to let go. 

Kenny (Will Poulter) reminds me when I was a teenage guy - shy and a virgin. I can relate to him. There are two scenes I liked involving Kenny and the first scene is when he raps and the second scene I like is when he is kissed by both Emma Roberts and Jennifer Aniston! 100% LUCKY!!!!!!!!!

Overall, this film was extremely funny, very sexy and dirty. The Millers are just the perfect "family". God Bless Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis as these two actors are very funny and I'm sure Emma Roberts as well as Will Poulter will have successful careers ahead.

Peace Out Ya'll!

This movie was so depressingly awful, we reached for a copy of Flirting With Disaster to relieve the trauma suffered by watching 40 minutes of this assault on the brain and senses. It's squarely the screenplay's fault which seems to have been written in a playground one afternoon and shot the next day. How any actor with name recognition agreed to be in this suck fest is beyond me.The entire flow of the movie seems like a high school play, with one scene setting up an idiotic premise and the next scene fulfilling it as badly as possible. None of the characters is in any way believable Jason Sudeikis comes across like a yuppie in a Verizon commercial from the get-go when he's passed off as a drug dealer- a sourpuss, unlikeable jerk. Jennifer Aniston is capable, but I don't buy her as a stripper for a second. And that Fundamentalist- Christian outfit from 1992 she has to wear throughout this torture fest is just too painful to watch. Ed Helms doesn't have to be believable as a marijuana cartel guy (chuckle, yeah, right, marijuana), but his lines are just so unfunny. When the border agents beat an old hippie senseless and the Mexicans scurried away from under the bus, I had to turn it off. How insulting to the nation of Mexico. After viewing Despues de Lucia hours before this waste of time, a movie set in Mexico City, it's obvious Mexican filmmakers and the characters they depict have more class and finesse in their little finger than the writer and director of We're The Millers will have in a lifetime.

Four stars sounds right for this film, which I just saw last night. 1 star being 'unbearably bad and difficult to sit through', and 10 being 'so good it changed my life', this movie was bearable to sit through, not painfully bad, but well... predictable and brainless.

The good news, I saw it in the right frame of mind- not in the mood to think. Cliché characters, unoriginal jokes, and predictable story notwithstanding, the pull of the movie were the four main stars, especially Jason Sudeikis. I haven't followed him in SNL but every other role I've seen of his: "30 Rock", "Portlandia", and a few other appearances here and there- the guy is funny and charismatic. I think Jen Aniston is also good.

So whatever- I can't recommend it unless you're tired, drunk, stoned, or suffering from a severe brain injury; otherwise, you could do worse.

PS The "bloopers" at the end looked fake to me.

No one will say this review helped them. I am absolutely astounded it gets as many stars and allocades as it does. "Best comedy"???? Please. This gratuitous profanity ridden (No, I'm not offended; it's just not necessary) piece of crap is not worth the bytes it takes to store.

Sure, you'll get some sophomoric laughs. Who wouldn't laugh if a nerdy kid got bitten by a spider so his right testicle swelled up to the size of a tennis ball, and he dropped his pants and showed everyone how little endowed he was. I mean, Hardy! Har! Har! That's just so funny!!! Hurry and put it on YouTube cause it'll get a million hits! Ha ha ha ha ha! Or how about the sex-starved housewife who actually (This was really hard!) touched another woman's breasts! WOW! That is just so risqué! Seriously, you thought this was a good movie? Really? Good Lord.

The gimmick is that a low-rent drug dealer has to really stretch himself, posing as a young happy-go-lucky father with two kids and a wife in order to be a "mule," someone who takes a load of drugs (in this case, marijuana) from Mexico back across the border. And the first of many problems is that Jason Sudeikis as David, with a moppy wig and five o'clock shadow, never seemed that rebellious in the first place for the transition to really matter.

The bogus family consists of his stripper neighbor Rose. Jennifer Aniston plays a sexy wild card with a contented personality no different from the good girls in her other movies, and that popular TV show. The two kids are just as unbalanced and unfunny; the sexy daughter's a homeless teen with an iphone and the boy, played by Will Poulter, is the "comic relief in a comedy film" character all the physical humor, like getting bitten by a tarantula and learning how to kiss a girl, relies on.

The surface of WE'RE THE MILLERS is liken to any of the VACATION films, but with a supposed edge. After all we're dealing with lowlifes stuck in a dire situation, especially after successfully crossing the border, only to be hunted by a Mexican drug lord resembling a swarthy magazine model.

You might think this sounds like more of an adventure than comedy, but even that potential is wasted on two prolonged scenes one involving our heroes awkwardly clashing with a nerdy conservative couple at a campground, and then being stranded at a fairgrounds, which just happens to be connected to an emergency room hospital. For a road movie there's simply not enough geography covered to make the trip very interesting. 

Sedeikis tries really hard to seem like he's not trying at all, wielding the popular brand of sarcasm where if you repeat the pandemonium around you, it's just as funny, if not funnier, than the situation itself and yet he comes off as one-dimensionally rude and mean-spirited, which might fit, say, a no-holds-barred HANGOVER style comedy (his doppelganger Ed Helms plays a snarky drug dealer), but with a cliché rom-com baseline beneath the forced blue humor, he's all dressed up with nowhere to go.
