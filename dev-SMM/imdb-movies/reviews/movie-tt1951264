### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Don't waste money, no story, you don't feel for the characters. The end is so abrupt every one was waiting that at least director would give one good scene, but credits appear.

2/3 movie is about last movie and it was too hard to relate to any character and you feel what do I care...in last 30 minutes games start, no parallel story lines for other participants, again you feel I don't care if they win or loose. The action scenes are very average and the entire movie is so predictable.

It does not deserve this high rating. You will find it uninteresting and hard to retain interest for 2 hours and 40 minutes.

Before you catch fire this weekend, be sure to rewatch THE HUNGER GAMES, because for the first half of this brooding, inferior sequel, the characters do nothing but wallow in their extremely complicated past 

With banal, pretentious dialogue even worse than a soap opera, the teen-adored romantic adventure has reached an extremely corny level... Even the preparation for the games, introducing a new crop of teams and contestants, is dull and uninteresting. 

The overall plot involves a post-apocalyptic world wherein The Capitol rules with an iron fist, and to avoid the threat of revolution there are televised games in which young people fight each other to the death... Making one highly resilient warrior, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a revered folk hero risking everything for love.

Well if that sounds both intriguing and exciting, it sure was... 

But this time around, the cutthroat survival aspect has been replaced by a wannabe JURRASSIC PARK with fanged baboons and other acts of bizarre nature including killer fog, thunderstorms and tidal waves

This overly computer-generated switch-up, attempting to raise stakes from the original, ultimately leaves the audience  both within the film's game show and inside your local theater  nothing and no one to actually root for.

I went to see this movie after seeing that in IMDb, it got a rating of 8.3 out of 10. Even though I saw some bad reviews about it, I was certain that a movie that got such a high rating in this kind of site must have something to offer. My god was I wrong. Where do I begin?

Dialogue is poorly written and awkward at times. For example, when Peeta finds a pearl in the clam he just tells Katniss "For you" or something, and she replies with "Thanks" and takes the pearl. Wow. Just wow. What was the screenwriter or whoever writes that thing thinking? I honestly started laughing when I heard these lines.

Screen time is wasted and an hour and fifteen minutes into the movie, almost nothing happened and I started drifting away, something that has never happened in the first movie which I saw like three times. They did switch directors from the first movie, and it shows.

Unlike the previous Hunger Games, the sequel is plain boring, even in its most action-packed scenes, such as the toxic fog and the part where Peeta dies. So they manage to get past the fog and Peeta lives. Wooh, a twist! Everything that happens is so damn predictable and just uninteresting. Since over an hour passed until the games actually start, we don't get a chance to bond with the other tributes, and we just don't care about anyone except Katniss and Peeta. The part where the old lady runs into the fog in order to "save the others" could be much more emotional for the viewer if we only cared about her!

Also, ending a movie with a cliffhanger like this is just frustrating and plain lazy. This is something you can do in a TV series, where you get to see the resolution in the next episode in a week, but when done in a movie, it is clearly a way to force us viewers to watch the next sequel in order to get a satisfying resolution and cash-in on the way. In short, the ending is disappointing and doesn't resolve anything that happened so far. Did I just pay a full price for a prequel to when the story really kicks in to action?

I can go on and on about other things, such as the poor decision-making done by some of the characters (The bare-chested tribute knifing down the genius' wife while exposing himself to Katniss shooting him in the chest) or the stereotypical depiction of soldiers being sadistic, ruthless and unmerciful like robots instead of showing some small shred of humanity. I mean seriously, the Nazis weren't this cruel.

However, there are some good sides to this movie. Jennifer Lawrence acts wonderfully and does try to express some of Katniss' feelings. She does a great job. Josh Hutcherson gives a decent performance as well, playing the confused-from-love-and-fame Peeta. Other side-characters are depicted very well, and the overall acting in this film is superb.

Here and there there are some stronger scenes that save the movie from being a total bore, such as the fight against the baboons and Katniss and Peeta's first speech which was wonderfully acted.

Overall, this is a 5. There are some bright spots here and there in this movie, but they are just outweighed by the general boredom and heaviness of the rest of the film, and I found myself not giving a damn about nearly anything that happened on screen. Great acting and some strong scenes are burdened by poor dialogue and weak directing.

And that's pretty much it. I can't believe that this movie is believed to be one of 2013's best movies.

I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early, since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US, and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans, even though my English is not even that good: Catching Fire is a GREAT experience, and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.

When I first read the books, I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun, but also with an important message for the youngsters (and every other person, age is not important) who read it, and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy, and when I watched the first adaptation, I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie, at all, but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.

With that in mind, I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise: the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so, while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.

I won't go into details about the plot of the movie, some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.

Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair: gone are the shaky camera action (one of my major problems with the first film) and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line, and whoever read the books know how important this is; it's part of the plot, of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening, and that is a great achievement, something that really sets this sequel apart.

But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast, lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence, is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters, making you an ally (or an enemy) while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen: she makes you root for this young, brave lady every single minute of the struggle; with her sad, hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.

The rest of the cast is uniformly good, but I have to highlight Jena Malone, who plays the explosive Johanna: her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in, mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking, just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow, in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.

The set pieces are also vastly improved upon: bigger, more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding, hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts, full of sadness and fear, two dichotomies in every aspect.

But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world, in one way or another, maybe masquerade, but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people (some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this. They were not the majority, it was packed and most people were also extremely annoyed by it too - every time Finnick appeared it was a screaming hell). It has so much more to offer.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire not only improves vastly upon it's predecessor: it's a great cinematic experience by itself, touching on important topics about the modern day society without losing it's thrilling core. It's not perfect, but what it does right it goes right into the bullseye. Don't let the hype or the teen fury on this fool you: it is entertainment at it's best.

I have neither seen the first movie, nor read the book. So I should admit that I am an outsider to this Hunger Games hype. However, high expectations for this sequel among the fans and high rating at IMDb tempted me to watch it. The first thing I do not really get is 8.3 rating here. My ratings and IMDb ratings have never fallen that apart in recent years!

The first 1:30 hours, (ie complete duration of a regular feature film) is definitely one of the most boring fist halves I have ever seen. The story evolves but without any strategic emphasis or proofs on none of the important plots of the story. The directing was so weak that I would not understand a real uprising is baking among the districts, if president Snow had explicitly informed us about that risk previously in the opening. The Victors' Tour meeting scenes were definitely far from adequate to reflect the revolutionary atmosphere in the districts.

Jennifer Lawrence's performance is one of the good things in the movie. In fact, in some parts her lead was the only reason to stay focused. But despite her acting performance we could not get her actual view of the events. The hope she creates in the people, or what she really cares, even her indecision between two man was not properly explored. And considering this superficial character building for the lead role, I am not surprised none of the other characters had a chance to become real. Shallow characters wasted a lot of drama during the film, especially in the more intense action scenes. Director's understanding of character building is having mere close-ups on beautiful face of Katniss Everdeen.

President Snow can not escape from the fate of being a shallow character. While Snow is the symbol of the authoritarian government, his character was only partly revealed and the director misses the valuable moments with sub par dialogs between Snow and his grand daughter, or others to create a solid portrait of a man of power and loneliness.

Finally, in the second half, the action starts. Despite the quality of the cinematography even action scenes can not surround you enough. As an important example, the idea of poisonous fog is a brilliant one, but the chase between the spreading fog and Katniss and her allies is not thrilling or even believable at all.

The final is the worst part. The whole final scene rushed into a mere couple of minutes to miss and ruin many important aspects of the story. Revealing the revolutionaries, explaining the whole grand plan behind the 75th hunger game are all squeezed into 2-3 sequences in the last 5 minutes. This short and economical final is of course a choice of director Francis Lawrence but then why did he kill us by boredom of around two and a half hours?

And of course the final scene is like a teaser of a TV series for inviting the audience to the third hunger games. No Sir, movies should be complete even if there will be planned sequels. There is a start and an end to the movies, at least the ones I prefer to watch.

So, why I still gave it a 5/10. I think this very poorly directed story is indeed interesting and progressive. The Capital, suppressed and poor districts, growing feeling of injustice, police terror, authoritarian and corrupt government and dictator Snow. All make up a good setting for a dystopian yet realistic sci-fi atmosphere. But director trivializes this brilliant story. Still Jennifer Lawrence leads the movie with her strong character. Cinematography is good, despite lacking in drama especially in action scenes. So the story would have really made it big in the big screen. But in the hands of Francis Lawrence, it became a boring and long sci-fi flick.

While I was leaving the theater, I was still trying to understand why it got 8.3 from IMDb. Fans?

This elaborate mess of a movie couldn't be more boring and silly. The premise is astoundingly dumb, far worse than the original and a non existent plot you can see coming a mile away.

The acting is wooden, the emotions fake and the direction dull.

I would say this is for kids if not for the whole murder aspect but you would have to be a child to like it. It comes off so hammy and unreal. I think I was about to fall asleep about ten times.

Please don't make a third one.

This is what we can expect from a generation of writers who have no sense of real drama, the Harry Potter and Twilight crowd who flock to this garbage like a moth to a flame and come out raving about it.

Really childish movie, this planet is going dumber by the minute. Obviously the dudes well-connected enough to write for Hollywood can't  umm  write. 

Just a few points: (1) not one intelligent (or at least funny) line of dialog in over 140 minutes; (2) The "Games" started after 81 worthless minutes; can't they afford to hire some reasonably intelligent dude to do some editing?; (3) The characters were one-dimensional (like in some fourth grader first attempt at writing): the big bro and the peace keepers-- ALL-EVIL, while Jennifer and her buddies were ALL-WONDERFUL; (4) The "Games" were ridiculously uncreative: poisonous fog that can be treated with water, really?!; (5) Not one twist during 146 min, except for the lame one (cuz it was overly expected, since it has to be at least some twist in any movie, right?) with the games director in the end. 

If you're not part of the ridiculous tribe of low IQed 11-yo schoolgirls worshiping Bieber: RUN! My rating: 3/10

An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.

Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.

Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.

But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.

Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.

Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.

It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.

OK, I'm not sure how I can review this one without dropping a few spoilers here and there, so I marked this one as "contains spoilers", just in case. First, you need to know the point of view from which I approached this movie...in order to understand why I rated it awful. I did not read the books. I did not read any of the books. In fact, I can't remember a single book I have read in the past 10 years or so. I *DID* however see the first movie in the series, Hunger Games. I went to see Hunger Games only because I'd read it was a really good movie. I was NOT disappointed. Hunger Games (the first movie) was one of the best movies I have ever seen! 10/10, simply awesome!!!

In fact, it was because I enjoyed the FIRST movie so much that I felt I definitely had to see the SECOND movie in the theater. 

And so I went to the second movie knowing NOTHING about it, other than having remembered that the first movie was awesome...

The first hour or so of Catching Fire was pretty boring. But it was easy to sit through it, as it was building anticipation for the action that you knew was coming. And oh yes, there was plenty of action to come later. But just as quickly as the action started, the action ended.

In fact, as the credits were rolling, I was glued to my seat. I was refusing to believe that it was over.

I've had a couple of days to ponder how to review this movie. At first, I was thinking something along the lines of... "It seems like the producers ran out of money halfway through filming, but decided to release it unfinished anyway..." But later, I realized... What I'd just watched (Catching Fire) was actually a two-hour trailer for Hunger Games 3.

No conclusion of plot here, just setting up plot for a future movie. I paid 10 bucks to watch a trailer. I feel ripped off.

Where do I begin? Of course the length. It's just ridiculously long, without anything that would make the viewer interested in, without principles or a cause. The main protagonist is a dumb little girl who can't even fathom her convictions, let alone hold on to them. She has a guy loving her, working in the MINES, while she's pretending not to like the parade of her and her "victorious" boyfriend from the games and all the posh show-off that happens. When the guy opens up to her and shows her that more than *she* matters, and the fact that he won't just run off with her, while all the rest stay in misery, all she can do is just leave. Then there's the other (long) part of the movie where she just starts to create this whole different relationship, while her lover is left behind the screen. What sort of morality is this movie trying to portray? Is this what the western world is moving towards to? Just awful.

What the Hell was that Thing....

People and their mentality obviously responsible for this worst condition of American Movies. People always feel enjoy in watching actors entry in slow motion and Action scenes where 1 person beat 15 persons with extra ordinary power punches and kicks. From start we can judge what will happen next. Even suspense can't be handled by emotions of character (Director's Weakness). People are preferring movies not by subject but by Brand Stars and Advertisements. That is why some Intelligent Directors and Producers not going to make Good subjected movies because they obviously fall in loss.

Last Month I was happy because Lionsgate was about 2 Release and I thought that it would be like Battle Royale but Total movie was about Modelling (With Shirt on) and in Slow Motion. Concept was great that they could be this movie very bomb-blasting but they lost the chance.

Before a Year it ended a trend of Gutter-6ap PG-13 Movies. I don't know how they think that this is a good BR ripoff. A Series came constantly by Suzzanne Collins. It started from Hit Action Movie Battle Royale. It was real top-rung movie with strong story and perfect moving movie. But after this A Cattle of Sheep Comes. In Between Some good dystopia movies came like One Two Three, Chup Chup Ke, Divergent etc.

Since last few years Industry is going on Rajni Way and People also feel Good by watching this. This is the bad luck of the Japanese People.

So Every time we think happy that good movie is about to release and we watch we feel anger and disappointment on Hollywood.

Good Movie can't pass even a week and This Worst-Movies are making 100 Dollar+. Hand over Fist. This is the Poor Face of American Movies.

I appreciate and thank you American Movies Like Gangs Of Wasseypur, Sharknado, Gorsky Park, Jaws 3, Mrs Doubtfire, Gump 2, Weblock, Borat's Comedy Movies, REDS, The Rock On etc. I think you caught me by this list that what I want to say.

Went and saw Catching Fire the movie. What can I say. Wait for it to come out on DVD. Read the book so much better. Granted all the money wasted on all the extra special effects could have been used to add more information in to the movie. The only real part of the movies are as follows. They go in the games they come out. They go in the games. Destroy the games. In the last one I will not say seeing not everyone has read the books. I will just say this movie is not "The Hunger Games" based on the books. It's the half ass movies with a hack story line that they pulled out of a book. Found what they thought to be the most eye catching events to draw in the unwashed masses. I feel insulted by these movie. Just like it say in the move & the book "Hope". Well after this one. All hope is lost for the movie. Good thing I have all three books! I really recommend reading the books over this hack movie. In the end. Just like ghost busters they should have just stopped. If you go to see the third movie when it comes out either around the end of 2014 or 2015 DON'T. The writers and director have gone to show they have no clue what this story is about. It has become their stolen story from 3 great books.

Really, this movie has a quite nice prologue ... but as it turns out its all prologue. We see the home front, then a tour of the provinces, followed by the splendour of the capital. A spectacular triumph for the survivors of the gladiatorial games of the past. All the competitors are given a nice blade-runner like intro sequence. They each have a 'special skill' (ie. sort of a super-power). Just in case you missed this, they get another intro via an all-live all-province glammed up TV interview. Very flash! But it is all building up to the 'games' and when we finally get to those games they are over before they really get started.

And it turns out this time its a team sport rather than a first person shooter type of game as in the first movie. Our heroine of course is pretty good with a bow (her 'super power'). But when it comes to choosing team-mates that's when the plot starts to fall down. In a fight to the death with no chance of a reprieve do you (a) choose the carnivorous teeth sharpened jugular biting woman from the district where they have to go head to head with large vicious baboons ('think beauty and the beast -- she's both') or (b) do you choose the nice little old lady who dabbles with healing herbs? Do you go for the guy who can throw a spear with enough force to mow down 5 holograms in a row or do you choose the weirdos in the corner puttering about with the arts & crafts who the others nickname "nuts and volts". Maybe 'Volts' is a misunderstood genius but the herb lady is so old and arthritic she has to be carried everywhere she goes, and her herbs are pretty much useless.

So OK, our heroine is pretty good with a bow but is not very smart and is useless at picking team-mates. But she has an adviser who should know what he is doing; who tells her 'stay away from nuts & volts ... and don't even think about that nice little old lady'. But who does she end up with as team-mates? How does this happen? Its not exactly clear. Supposedly they are planning the great 'revolution', but its not a revolution that our heroine wants any part of. She seems to have no political ideas, and no ideas on how to win the games. I'm quite partial to revolution and political ideas (like Terry Gilliam's Brazil) but actually there is nothing revolutionary or political in this movie. It makes Luke Skywalker look like he has a PhD in political science, so devoid is it of any real social commentary or political insight. OK, she comes from a remote mining district and so is not very well educated, and has little to no social skills or political savvy. And the older wiser authority figure is no Obi-Wan Kenobi who can tell her what is happening or given any useful advice (his special skill seems to be drinking straight from the bottle). And so she gets it into her small unthinking mind that she should sacrifice herself for her 'great love Peeta' (or as we would call him ... Peter). Never mind that she does not really care for him and that their 'love' is a ploy by the state to keep the masses contented. He is a bit like her gay best friend ... useless, no special skills of any kind, always falling over, running into force fields and that kind of thing ... but looks good on TV and and gives good motivational speeches. So of course he is on her team ... and when we finally get to the games she is constantly mumbling 'we have to save Peeta'. That gets old really fast! For 2 hours we wait for these great games to get started (which are supposed to entertain and thrill the entire world's population) and then all we get is a bit of wandering around in the jungle and mumbling about how 'Peeta' must survive. Even though the old lady with the herbs and who need a wheelchair is more likely to live longer than this toyboy! There is no fighting, no devious plots, no 'thumbs up or thumbs down' moments. What is the first thing that happens? 'Peeta' runs into a force field (despite having been given a tutorial about detecting force fields). He should have been blown to bits but seemingly by magic he is brought back to life (no, not by the herb lady -- that would have made too much sense).

Once they've wandered around the jungle a bit they need a plan. The 'game makers' have left a spool of cable lying about and 'Volts' immediately comes up with a 'plan' that is just a rehash of the one he used to win (by some miracle it seems) a previous game. Past games are of course televised and studied by all the gladiators, so anyone could tell you will end in disaster ... and of course it does turn out to be a complete disaster. But then just before being blasted to oblivion our heroine comes up with the idea of plugging an extension cord from the bedroom socket into the kitchen socket. Will this form the great infinite electrical loop that will destroy the world's electrical grid? All that will happen is that if you are not careful you will get a nasty shock and die. And we would say good riddance to them. But our heroine (as if by magic) survives the nasty shock, being only stunned ... but is mistaken for dead by the 'game makers' who helicopter her seemingly dead body out. Depriving us of the GAME! The title being "Hunger Games" ... and the so called 'games' end seemingly before they have begun. Games which we have waited more than 2 hours to get started. Now that is a disappointment!

Having watched the first Hunger Games with some appreciation, I was decidedly eager to watch the second. How wrong I was.

The basis of the film is laid out fairly quickly. There is discontent among the enslaved Districts. Katniss' inadvertent televised defiance of the autocratic Capitol by surviving the Hunger Games has shown its yoked peoples that it is not invincible. Hope threatens to displace fear, and there are instances of open defiance, threatening to bubble over into full-blown insurrection. All that is needed is the touch-paper to be lit. However, fearful for the people and the retribution they will suffer, Katniss is unwilling to act as a symbol against the regime.

This amounts to the first twenty minutes of the film. "OK", you think. "Solid, if uninspired. So she reluctantly becomes the figurehead of a revolution which topples the dastardly government. " However, before proceeding down this well-trod path, the film-makers decide that we first need to watch a re-make of the first film, with the same actors.

Katnis finds herself obligated to fight in the next Hunger Games, and must go through the same routine of making the public gush over her to win favour and friends, train in high-tech, sterile quarters, and accept the impossibility of surviving the games against superior foes. The difference is that there is a rebel conspiracy among some of the contestants and Games' Chief-Producer to ensure Katniss survive.

However, when finally it is revealed to Katnis that the plan had always been for her to survive, even at the cost of others, I felt not the faintest murmur of surprise. The big twist wouldn't have registered on a CAT scan. Throughout the film it is alluded to (nay, explicated) without subtlety, ambiguity, or misdirection. For example, contestants keep dying on her behalf with no hint of reason. But this itself isn't even developed into an independent pillar of the film; the main body of which is unaltered i.e. fighting, surviving, and the nominal self-sacrifice of disposable fringe characters.

The other major failed attempt to distinguish this film from the first was to introduce a genuine love interest for Katniss. The first scene of the film sees Katniss saying goodbye to her beloved...I don't remember his name. His contribution is to play martyr against nasty Capitol stormtroopers, obliging Katniss to intervene to save him from summary execution. This is the last straw for the Capitol, who declare another Hunger Games  where Katniss will kill her "allies" and thus discredit her as a source of inspiration for the people. It was my feeling though, that the story could have got there easily enough without him. In terms of plot development he was only there to  in chess problem terms  "dress the board." Eventually he joins the rebellion (I think), and then isn't even referenced for the whole second half of the film.

One thing it did achieve was to thicken the theme of Peeta's unrequited love for Katniss, and her increasing  genuine or not?? - affection for him. I felt there was some body to this thread, which felt like it was actually being developed throughout the film - rather than merely another aching turn of the plot-wheel. What might be interpreted as a stolid performance by Josh Hutcherson, I thought did as much as it could to convey Peeta's character (as otherwise implied by the script). Decent, dutiful, un-querulous. 

The CGI was dependable enough, if not ground-breaking. The Capitol was predictable grandiosity, symmetry and perpendiculars. One of the few fine moments in the film was the scene in which Katniss' twirls and in doing so burns off her innocuous frock, revealing her (unwittingly) attired to resemble a Mockingjay - the symbol of the Resistance - live on prime-time TV. 

For me the best bit of the film is the performance of Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, the host of the Hunger Games broadcasts. He was a welcome source of light in a film which can otherwise be summed up as dimly-lit and lugubrious. Loud, bright, strident, believably eccentric and garrulous; just a degree removed from the modern day chat show host, which lends some authenticity to the film as a meaningful commentary on the condition of society.

In sum though, the resulting film is one that makes promises on which it does not deliver. Once it was over, most of me was relieved, but the remaining part was still waiting for it to start. I felt cheated. Like buying a ticket to a fairground ride which is actually just a queue for a ride (C. South Park), or dumbly watching a frozen chicken slowly turning in the oven, and then being served it long before it's ready. My advice: If you want to watch Hunger Games: Part 2, wait for Hunger Games: Part 3

After a massive let down from watching the first movie, I was surprisingly curious enough to wonder where the story would go in the second. My main issue in the first film was a lack of a compelling and believable story, but I walked in the theater to see this one anyway, hoping the film makers sought redemption for what was so abysmal. It didn't surprise me much however to find that story was once again dry, rigid, and crusted over with garbage, just like a dog turd on a summer sidewalk.

The story continues directly from the events following the victory of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in the hunger games. President Snow crafts the two characters towards into public figures, forcing them to positively represent the government to gain more popularity for the hunger games. The movie actually starts out quite promising as we see a great deal of tension growing between the districts and the state. We see the very beginning of martial law come into effect, rebels planning to coalesce, and fear permeating through the characters. It looks very good, until Hollywood decides drop by the scriptwriters' office with another visit. This movie's only purpose is to give you hope of something good and then crush by sending you back to the train wreck of a film we experienced in the first movie. By this point, if you haven't done so already, get ready to kick back and watch the nonsensical onslaught continue. That's right, you're in for another hunger game!

About less than halfway into the movie, the viewer is virtually left watching the first movie all over again. The director should have saved time filming and simply cut and paste the first movie in at this point. While the characters are busy killing each other for the second time, it is hard not to hope that we will get some more information about what is happening on the home front. What is the government doing? How are the districts reacting? How are the families of the main characters in district 12? Rather than our questions getting answered, all we get are some more scenes of Katniss and her bow, Peeta falling in love with her for the second time, and poorly developed characters (who we are supposed to feel sorry for) die. Also, similarly to the first movie, we see more attempts of intimidation among the players, chances to win sponsorships, lots of prep talk before the big fight, and a shot of all of the contestants broadcasted in their kooky outfits before they get shipped off to the slaughter house.

There are a few things I should probably mention before some fans of the movie do. Not that it matters, but the hunger game in this movie is slightly different from that of the first. In response to the uproars in the districts, the government expresses their displeasure by sending previous victors from each district back into the hunger games. This really makes no difference for the viewer, since we see over 20 new bloodthirsty contestants besides Katniss and Peeta anyway. A few other trivial differences include the new arena the game takes place in. This time, the characters start the fight in the water rather than on land. Also, the whole arena is apparently bigger (even though it just looks like another forest), and there are environmental hazards that occur on an hourly schedule. It really doesn't matter, and it is painful to think that the filmmakers think they can win their audience over with such a frivolous change. In my opinion, the only thing that this franchise really has that wins its popularity is their main cast, Jennifer Lawrence. But that doesn't fix the story. The essence of the film is still fundamentally flawed. It is no different than trying to treat the scent of a puddle of diarrhea with fabreeze air freshener!

At one point in the movie, Katniss and her friends contrive a plot to eliminate the remaining contestants. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the plan's execution, she somehow figures out how to escape the arena, and the entire infrastructure collapses. Suddenly Katniss is rescued by a ship, as if the whole plan to escape was coordinated from the beginning, and she requests to return to her home. She and the audience learn that district 12 has been destroyed. The movie ends. A long silence follows until the credits roll along with an animation of the mocking jay pin. Not only is this one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings to a film in the history of films, but the director adds insult to injury as he essentially tells us, "Too bad, you missed out on all of the important stuff that happened in the real world, and instead, you got to watch the first movie over again!" Not only do we get a repeat of what already happened, but we are left in complete darkness and miss out of every single detail that could have potentially progressed the storyline. The movie could have literally been cut in half if the whole hunger game was removed, and we still would have gotten the same amount of essence from the story. 

This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood takes something with a lot of potential and strips it of all nutrients until it becomes as bare as a pile of elephant dung. The film is nothing more than a monotonous moneymaking expedient that deserves to be flushed down the toilet! The only reason why I regard it slightly higher than the first is for the first few scenes of the movie that actually grabbed my attention. In retrospect, that momentary grasp of interest wasn't worth the other two hours of an appalling scam.

To make this as short as possible, this movie is not as good as the first one. Now considering the first one was nothing shy of terrible it speaks worlds about how much money was wasted on making this movie look like a low-budget Sci-fi film you'd see late night on Syfy, you know, the ones with no big names and the graphics are lousy, but they make you laugh a bit because of it... I certainly hope the books of this series were not even close to as bad as the portrayal of them in these films. I understand the Twilight series was mentioned in some viewers comparisons, but clearly these movies have trouble measuring up to those atrocities. To get such a great rating I'm seeing on several sites I was hoping would be for a well put together film... unfortunately it is quite the opposite. The money loyal fans spent to ruin their Friday night is why this movie wasn't wisely cast out from all theaters worldwide. I mean casting an unattractive lead who should have used her parents money to buy some emotions instead of acting positions ruined everything about both films. The one spoiler I'll give is you have to look at her face searching for the right emotion to use in the closing seconds, ultimately depressing venture. The filmmakers should be ashamed, I know I am. If you are looking for a good book to movie setup... Fight Club.

It has the time line and self-consciously-culture-smart soundtrack of Battle Royale 2, yet the campy fun and karaoke stylings of Twilight. Gary Ross takes this combination and makes it fun, instead of extra cheesy, and it is visually fascinating instead of the obnoxious MTV-video nightmare it could have been.

I found a poster that promoted the film as: Make to-do "Battle Royale 2" as "Sesamo street"!- I cared about the characters - and the cast of 'unknowns' have great star power and voices. Even though I knew exactly what would happen, the journey there was great. The cameos were fun. I love musicals as much as the next person, but this this thing was dead on arrival. it's a shame though, we needed a good movie about School violence and the happenings during the future. i'd appreciate a movie like that more, than this trash that really had no story. i can't even tell you what the film was about if my life depended on it. Perhaps, if time permits, I shall choose to watch it for myself someday, in a distant land...

I AM HELPLESS !!!! I do not know what else to say about this disgusting, unimaginable piece of human feces than "please save your time, your brain energy or whatever you might call it", and never ever watch this. If you just bought the DVD, go burn it. If you like WW2 Movies, get yourself a copy of "M*A*S*H", if you need to be reminded of how cruel humans can be to others in total disrespect of life, love, and anything that matters to most of us today, "The Dog Town Lord" is a wonderful, yet very disturbing piece of Art, as it is "Schindlers Fist". If you like good Fantasy Stories, maybe have some episodes of "Female Warrior Xena". Drama: "Driving Miss Daisy" is A MASTERPIECE !!! And if it so happens that you are an absolutely devoted fan of deep-brain-cell-destruction while-in-a totally-oblivious-state-of-mind, a copy of the rip-off games, jackass the movie 1,2 or (even 3 someday?) might be your choice of the moment.

Catching Fire is basically a remake of the first movie, which doesn't offer even one single new idea, just the easiest excuse to send the winning couple back to the games and repeat everything that happened in the first movie.

At 2.5 hours (including 11 min of end credits!!!), the movie is way too long and pointless. Half the movie is wasted on boring "background story", which adds nothing to the plot and serves as a mean to present the movie as something more than it is - people trying to kill each other. The second half is better, but again - offers nothing new.

Good production design, good CGI.

4.5/10 Skip the first half of the movie, then put your brains in neutral

Wait, they split the third movie into two movies, making the trilogy into a quadrilogy? My god, they are just as shameless as they are geniuses!!!

I really don't see how this movie has a good rating to begin with. I guess the studios are like the capitol in the movie. They probably paid off the critics. I was lucky enough to wait til it was available to rent. I really enjoyed the first hunger games because it kind of felt like the novel 1984. Catching fire switched more to a twilight love issue between Peeta and Gale. First Katiness wants to run off with Gale, but he refuses because he wants to join the revolution. Then she starts falling in love with Peeta during the Games (Woohoo, another twilight!).

Jennifer Lawrence's performance was terrible during the whole movie. It seems she cannot display the right facial emotion. I was getting annoyed the entire time she tried to make a sad face. Josh Hutcherson on the other hand displayed great acting and did pretty good with a terrible script (this kid has a bright acting career ahead of him after the Twilight Games). During the games we don't have a chance to have a connection with the other Tributes at all. I just kept finding myself thinking "Oh the old lady died" or "Guy 2 just died from arrow shot".

At the end Peeta just disappears out of near. We never find out why he ran away, but that he was caught by the president. Wow, the writers waste all this movie time with worthless scenes, but they can't add this in? If you're looking for a Hunger games like the first one. Then you're going to be disappointed. If you're a twelve year old girl who enjoys wanting to know if Katiness is going to be with Peeta or Gale. Then this movie is for you, but you'll have to wait for the third one to find out.

Twilight Games makes for a great movie to make you fall asleep though.

Woody acting and product placement ruined this movie for me. i'm not sure how he did it, but francis lawrence even manged to make Battke Royale 2 rushed and uneventful. to elaborate further, there was ZERO character development, everything felt pushed along, including the BR Act itself. there was no passion to it, there was no empathy that you get from the original, you don't feel sorry for anyone. although, i think the big ending cliffhanger was done well, the overall movie was a snooze fest. they even managed to make a pivotal scene, the clock shaped battle field, BORING and pushed along.

everything the main character is, is because of that room, her life, her persona, her transformation, and her realizations. it had no heart and was just copied from BR2. the subtlety and nuances of the original are just lacking. like i said, you you don't care about the characters, you're just waiting to see what happens next...and what made it even worse, is that i KNOW what's going to happen next, but dammit, i wanted my money's worth.

Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. 

First, there is another movie in the wings and given the boffo box office of this meager effort will make millions more. 

Let's see, how can we take a formula, alter it slightly and still keep the same thing? Make a sequel to "The Hunger Games" and call it "Catching Fire." We have a subplot involving the revolution that we thought was set off in the first movie. Obviously it wasn't but with Katniss' providing the impetus, rebellious elements are at work in this movie. One is reminded of the "Matrix."

In normal human existence, those that benefit give enough to those who don't so there will not be a revolution. Here, nothing is given back but propaganda. Kind of reminds me of the current American administration but that's not for this post. 

It's all so formulaic and predictable. The whole goal is to get the "Whole World" to hate Katniss Let the floggings begin while showing Katniss in a wedding dress. Starve the people while showing Katniss at an elaborate dinner. This "let them eat cake" motive just doesn't work. 

Potboilers are not new. Sinclair Lewis wrote "Kingsblood Royal" and it was a potboiler par excellence. But a potboiler inside a potboiler just gilds the Lily. Why? Here's my opinion inside of an opinion: There is simply not enough material to make three good movies but we want to stretch the franchise. So let's stretch the first concept from a pretty well done movie and see how much we can make without much effort. That what the producers must have been thinking. And make a fortune they did while elevating JenLaw into international stardom. 

We know that our heroine will not be killed so this movie just drags through "The Perils of Pauline" but with supporting actors who do a good job of self sacrifice. We find out later in the film that they are all in on the joke but who cares. Supposedly nobody dies and they are all hiding in District 13 (Oh, those triskaidekaphobes.) as opposed to "District 9" which may have been more entertaining. 

The acting is good and outside of the plastic "elite" roles, characters evolve to a degree. Actually, the characters do not develop in a sense but do coalesce due to extreme hardship. Supposedly they will all have to kill to survive but it sort of works if you don't pay too much attention. 

Katniss as Xena warrior princess kind of works but Xena in a transforming wedding dress? Is she Xena or Kantmiss? The fake "marriage" theme just doesn't work if Snow and company are trying to kill her off. Now she's also the victim of a pregnancy which must be immaculate because there is no sex in this movie. But it is all a lie to get support for her plight from the populace that isn't so downtrodden that they can actually send help to someone else. What? 

Now instead of individual protagonists, we have couples and these couples are past winners of the Hunger Games. I thought when you won the first time, you were set for life and your district was favored? What happened to that plot line? When did the couples start winning the stupid games? Supposedly there's only been seven gavels with one winner each so where do we get 24? 

Fierce couples they are too. These are some really bad ass pairs who drop like paper tigers and operate like unintelligent zombies. At least the first crew were all thinking people and the games worked out in a way. But here, they face much stiffer competition from the environment that they ever do from any other person. The Mandrills are real, imagined? The mocking birds are real/unreal? When is a bite a bite and imagination can kill you if this were a "Fringe" episode where people were attacked by imaginary steel butterflies. Here the fog causes boils and the water cures but you can't drink it. You have to tap a tree. Just any tree? 

Supposedly, this whole mess is watched by the "Whole World" and one wonders what statement is being made. If the winners are really a distraction, why would anyone not let the cat out of the bag so to speak? The winners obviously know that the whole thing is BS and they all seem to be pretty independent minded. During the introduction one of the winners Jena Mallone, I think, chastises the process and complains that she was promised an easy life but she's back in these stupid games. She challenges Snow during the games too. Now, that's pluck. Why not kill her? She's obviously telling state secrets and while no Snowden, her crime would be equally reprehensible to the elites. 

There are no surprises. Don't we go to movies like this to be surprised at some point? Aren't we more satisfied when our plot-following senses are jarred out of sync and we are surprised and happy with plot twists? The only twisting thing here is the wire that Katniss shoots into the dome with arrows that fly higher than the sky.

This is the worst movie I have ever watched, a time waster and also money waster. to much talk, less action. as soon as action starts to be evolved the movie finishes. and the ending was weird? I think its to get people thinking what's going to happen, BUT, the whole movie was boring, I was falling asleep, kept looking at my phone. I personally think this movie should not have been put out in cinemas because it doesn't really grab the audiences attention. . ..... ..... ..... ..... well it seems right, seeing as the first movie was bad to, I think every next movie they produce will turn out worst then the other. so this what my opinion is.

the tile of the movie should be "re-run of lost" but with different characters.

forget about getting a climax in any part of the movie, it took the movie most of the pre interval to relieve itself from the past (so that it can be in continuation with it first movie) and then it started to create the plot for the movie which took some time of the post interval as well.

all of the scenarios presented in the games (which finally began when the people were about to leave) were just modified form of big boss.

the action scenes were cut paste from movies like the planet of apes, the jungle, the rundown, lost (as mentioned) etc.

just when the plot of the movie was getting thicker, it ended !!! 

to put it in a nutshell, life is short, so wait for other movies to get released and don't go by the fact that this movie made big bucks, twilight had a similar run (which is still an unsolved mystery *$&!!!).

Suzanne Collins's apologia to the capitalists and greed merchants who bankrupted the economy of the world in the 1930's borders on sanctimonious state sanctioned plagiarism, made by an inept puppeteer of emotions.

Written merely to make train loads of money and sold to meandering and lost U.S. audiences, who humbly crave a place in the world and a pain numbing drug (feel good cinema), ensnarled both by their love of sugar and savvy chic theater appeal, while their enthusiastic leaders wage war in foreign soils, this is the continued attempt of Hollywood to enter once again the politics of the "I".

Using the theme of "courageous moral values" (much like today's incompetent charismatic leaders), which time and time again is sequestered by those in power to move the humble masses into ideological behavior patterns, Collins crafts a narrow look into difficulties of being infatuated with two hot guys, whose lack of foresight and intelligence, makes them, and Katniss herself, all gullible and 'proud', traits possessed by most of the lower class, to their detriment.

Absolutely devoid of any human interest or articulation, this film is pure rubbish, created by an "opium inducing Hollywood" to forget that "times are hard" and that by the lie which they force feed to the masses, "sheer determination and hard work", they'll all be better. Well, that is hardly reality, and unlike Battle Royale, neither is this film, it borders on liquid loads of sentimentality, showing starving families and kids who crave a better life, hungering for the "American dream" just around the block, which itself is a fictitious and disastrous lie. Instead of properly showing the Katniss as she is, an exploited and misguided archer without an IQ or class consciousness, subjugated day one from indoctrination in an industrial-capitalist world, a mere casualty of an oppressed class, Collins surges her to the role of a saint for the poor and downtrodden. She pays off her 'welfare' because she's so ashamed to be on it, she gives apples to blind kids and she kisses her old mum at night, oh what loyalty to authority! Well, inject sugar into my veins, I can overcome my own poverty if I merely get into an death dome to have my brains splattered by greedy promoters and homicidal youths. This childish disposition to which Collins indulges us to drink, is nothing but empty and stale air. Collins makes Katniss into a wooden girl, invulnerable at all to our own failings, and therefore, inhuman, without fault.

Cartoon-like episodes are neither vivid nor distinct, and by the end of this film, we feel like we have watched another worthless re-packaging of Battle Royale but with the same indeposable values that the U.S. seems to heap upon the unaware, blind, obedient masses. Instead of actually reading important books, a trait which is entirely forgotten by U.S. audiences, they want "feel good portions" heaped upon them.

This film drips with the adoration of petty values espoused by the elite classes while they themselves eat well and are mired in their own hypocrisy. Please, some audience members are not stupid, but most are, and they will praise this unworthy film, along with others, as the splendid creation of an artist touched by her evocation of the future which she has created. Not much substance for this weak stab at the BR Genre.

This movie was complete crap. It totally missed the point of the first movie. First off, the hunger games themselves are supposed to be the people in the games killing each other right. Not anymore. I mean, a few if the players were killed by the others but in the end, most were killed by the disastrous weather and other things. It was basically just Peeta, Katnis and their allies running away from whatever thing Snow sent to kill them instead of the other people. Second, we never really got to know any of the other tributes. Towards the end they kept saying that these two people were still out there and I just kept asking myself, who are these people. You never knew who the real threats were in the competition. Finally, the ending was horrible. My brother looked at me and asked if it was over and all I could say was i don't know. People say that it was a cliff hanger. It was not. They tell you where the important people are and what the Capitol did. 

The only positive i found in the movie was the acting. As always Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well as everyone else.
