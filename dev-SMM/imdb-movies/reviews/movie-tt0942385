### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I just got out of a midnight showing and I was absolutely blown away. I fully expect this to be a mediocre movie at best, but it surprised me in all aspects. It was well directed, acted, the action scenes were actually very well done and pretty epic, and most of all it was hilarious. I doubt I stopped laughing for more than a minute or two. I don't want to give anything away so I will keep it brief, but do yourself a favor and see this in theaters with friends.

PS. As a black man, I did not find Robert Downey Jr.'s character offensive at all. He was probably the most hilarious character in the movie.

'Tropic Thunder' is the sharpest, nastiest, and most honest parody of Hollywood since Altman's 'The Player'.

If Doweny Jr. in black face, the script's use of "retard", or the politically incorrect humor offends you, you're missing the point.

Only Russel Crowe, Robin Williams, and Harvey Weinstein should take offense. The parodies of their personalities, their films, and their business tactics are downright cruel. (But, so, so true, and so brilliant.) I must credit every actor -- particularly Downey Jr. and Cruise -- for their performances, and for making their characters more than stereotypes for cheap laughs.

The more you know about Hollywood, the more you will appreciate the film. If not, just go and laugh at the genre. It takes balls to leave in a scene discussing how Blue-Ray conquered HD-DVD (and expect anyone to fine it funny). But it is funny.

To utterly relish the insanity, brush up on 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'.

They got it so right. So, so, so right.

Despite my somewhat indifference, bordering on dislike, of Ben Stiller and most of what he does, Tropic Thunder has been on my much-anticipated list for some time now. The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up "directed" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.

To take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.

Directly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went "full retarded, no one ever comes back from that"; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like "the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude". The levels at play here are just too many to mention.

Besides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring "fake" blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.

There were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a mustnot to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have.

Advanced screening: Toronto (July 31, 2008) Tropic Thunder is a film I've anticipated (from it's trailers/ Downey Jr's "Blackface" controversy) for quite awhile, but knowing Ben Stiller's hit (Reality Bites) or miss (Zoolander) directing filmography, I kept my expectations relatively lukewarm. Luckily that wasn't necessary because it's Stiller's best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.

Starting with the best fake-trailers this side of Grindhouse, TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satire/action/ and gross-out I've ever seen. At first it appears to be a straight-up spoof on popular war films, then it becomes a film within a film, then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking (and hilarious) sight gags (exploding film-crew members, the brutal slaughter of an endangered species) that managed to catch everyone off guard (yet not offend them).

The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it's stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive, while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances. Ultimately it is Downey Jr. who steals almost every scene as the platoon's very white, African-American squad leader.

Rude, witty, and ballsy, TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. It's hard finding worth-while large budget comedies these days, but DIRECTOR Ben Stiller, supported by a strong cast and a great premise, has proved himself to be the right man for the task. 8/10

Very rarely do comedies hit the mark in terms of both smart humor and dumb humor in the same movie, let alone the same scene. That's what we've got with Tropic Thunder, a comedy that excels in both satirical jokes and laugh out loud stupidity. If you're game for any of that, in addition to quite possibly the funniest and most shocking cameos of all time, then Tropic Thunder is the perfect movie to close the summer of 2008 with.

Ben Stiller has always been the poster boy for trying to mix these two severely different types of humor recently, and has failed in his other two main directing attempts (although Zoolander was funny). Here, he more than succeeds in making Hollywood the laughingstock of the summer, and who better than Stiller to do so, someone who has been around the business his entire life.

Obviously, what's going to get the most laughs is our cast, which is one of the best comedy casts assembled, in my opinion. Our supporting performers are just as strong, if not stronger than our big three leads (definitely stronger than Jack Black), and we are treated to some of the funniest cameos of all time...One of Tropic Thunder's cameos, one of the most famous and serious actors in the world, nearly steals the movie, and is funnier than the last time he did a role like this (Austin Powers 3). If you don't know who I'm talking about by now, just wait until you see him. He'll have you on the floor laughing by the end of the movie. Other cameos (including a Judd Apatow boy and a former People's Sexiest Man Alive) are entertaining, but they have nothing on the big guy.

Now, to the actual cast...Starting with Stiller himself. Stiller has always been great at playing over the top asses, and that's what his character here is. There's plenty of exaggeration, plenty of laughs, but I felt there could have been more arrogance and more development in his character. The film belongs to Robert Downey Jr. (why am I not shocked by this?), who could sneak a Golden Globe nomination in if he's lucky for his performance as super-serious star Kurt Lazarus. Downey is absolutely hilarious, yet believable as this actor who believes acting is larger than life, and provides for the best satire of all. Jack Black is, if anything, forgettable and provided few laughs (though he does deliver one of the funniest lines of the movie). Jay Baruchel and Brandon Jackson are great in their supporting roles, and were the most well rounded characters (especially Baruchel). Danny McBride (three out of the last four movies I've watched have had this guy in it) of Pineapple Express is just as great here in another hilarious role tailor made for him. Nick Nolte is an odd presence, but an asset nonetheless. Steve Coogan's short role is memorable.

Stiller's main point in the film was obviously to make fun of Hollywood and his fellow actors as well, and he succeeds enormously. The fact that mentally challenged rights groups are calling for boycotts only proves Stiller's point: we all need to chill out, and stop taking things so seriously (where's The Joker when you need him?). The "bad" scene where the characters say 'retard' a few times is actually one of the best satire scenes in the movie. The scene isn't making fun of mentally challenged people, rather the actors that have won Oscars for playing them. Dustin Hoffman and Peter Sellers are not spared.

Like Pineapple Express before it, Tropic Thunder suffers from a less than stellar second act, which is used to attempt to ground the film in reality. This is unnecessary. We know that this could never happen. Insurance policies wouldn't even let a director think about doing what Coogan's character does in this film. However, the film starts and finishes very well (in fact, it starts better than any comedy of the year). It finishes with roars of laughter, and even though it is just absurd, it doesn't matter, because we've had a great time along the ride. Yes, Tropic Thunder is vulgar, but nowhere near the other Apatow brand products out these days. There's some blood and graphic violence, but nothing too bad.

"Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written "Zoolander" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls- to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do." -another critic

I went to see this at an advance showing last night and spent much of the time laughing. The beginning as previously mentioned is extremely creative with a clever cameo from Tobey Maguire and once the movie begins it is non-stop humor from start to finish. The star of the movie by far is Robert Downey Jr who is simply perfect but the real scene stealer is Tom Cruise, though his screen time is limited, his scenes are hilarious. Definitely one to repair the somewhat tarnished image of the past few years. Stiller is his usual self but is overshadowed by Black and Downey Jr. not surprising given the multiple roles he played behind the scenes. Wall to wall cameos, particularly at the end (blink and you'll miss them) and I really won't tell you which the funniest cameo was as that may spoil this gem of a joke....provided you catch it that is! highly recommended movie - I will definitely be heading out to see it when it comes out for general audiences!

Damn, is Robert Downey Jr. on a roll Rarely (if they occur at all) have comebacks been so bold and so memorable. When slated to star as Tony Stark in May's Iron Man which kicked off the blockbuster season with a bang and a slap, the public, excluding his die-hard supporters of course, were baffled at the atypical casting choice of the Marvel hero. For myself, I have always loved Downey Jr. from his excellent portrayal as Charlie Chapin, to his perfectly suited role in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he is always the best thing about a film. Lightening struck again (or I suppose first, if you want to follow his career chronologically) midyear with his smart portrayal as an overprotective principal in Charlie Bartlet, so it only seems suitable for him to cap off the summer with his best work yet.

Directed by, and starring Ben Stiller, Tropic Thunder is an epically vast improvement over the suicide inducing effort that was Zoolander and finds Stiller in his best comedic acting form since Meet the Parents. Our adventure follows a group of primadonna actors who are shooting a high budget war epic in Vietnam. As director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) sees his funds draining and his production falling apart at the hands of the maddeningly inept cast, the inspiration for the movie "Four Leaf" Tayback (Nick Nolte) suggests that the film would be better shot guerrilla style using hidden cameras and some improvisation. But, after a series of unfortunate (but hilarious) events leave the troupe stranded, they must both save the picture which their careers are riding on, and possibly themselves at the same time. Adding the flavour to this endeavour are Tugg Speedman (Stiller) as a flailing action has-been, Jack Black, who has also had a successful year, as Jeff Portnoy, an Eddie Murphy-esquire comic, Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky, rapper turned actor Alpha Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and of course Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) as the Oscar winning method actor. We also get career high cameo and supporting work from various familiar Hollywood faces, Mathew McConaughey and the much buzzed appearance by Tom Cruise, who is simply fantastic.

The most satisfying aspect of Tropic Thunder is that despite show stealing work from Cruise and Downey Jr. everyone gets their slice of the comedy pie. One actor is never in the spotlight too much, and nobody hogs the funny too much. And boy is there a lot of funny; this film is one of, if not the best satire made about Hollywood and the jokes come high and low, subtly and bluntly, and they almost always strike home. Controversy has been in the air surrounding both Downey Jr.'s blackface portrayal as an African American and gags surrounding a film Tugg Speedman had previously filmed in which he was mentally handicapped. While it is inevitable that some will be offended, it is important to remember that both of these jabs are not against such groups, but against Hollywood who churns out method actors who take their job with a block of salt, not a grain. Even complaints I have read regarding this film I see as intentional inclusions by Stiller, who I believe has been in the business too long to have done such without careful thought and consideration.

The film starts without warning with a series of phony trailers featuring the stars of the feature, and are some of the funniest segments I have ever seen, especially that of Downey Jr.'s. Tropic Thunder does not let up however as the ready to quote one-lines, again mostly from Downey Jr. and Cruise, come so fast you will have to make a list once the film has concluded. All in all, this picture is what we needed, a biting satire/spoof that doesn't have the word Movie after it. With a similar action/comedy hybrid formula as this year's Pineapple Express (which both star Danny McBride), Tropic Thunder pours on the laughs like a storm and presents a wit that is nothing less then lightening quick.

When an all-star Vietnam film is put in the hands of a first time British director, the results are an ego-dominated shambles that is a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting. Director Damien Cockburn makes a decision that the experiences of "Four Leaf" Tayback will be best captured on film by dropping the basic cast in the jungle and forcing them to experience as close to reality as possible while catching it all on camera. Sadly when Cockburn is killed by a mine mere minutes into the mission, the cast are left in the middle of a dangerous jungle, not entirely sure of whether this is real or not.

When I went to see this film I hadn't expected it to be much more than a basic comedy but the reality is that this is a pretty smart satire of Hollywood and movie acting that also produces silly laughs one would expect from a Ben Stiller film. The "black-face" issue has been mentioned in regards the film walking a fine line between being funny or offensive but to me the bigger tightrope act is between being funny and being stupidly silly. Here and there it gets very close to falling over that line (eg all of Tom Cruise's stuff) but if you are with it then it manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. The daft plot allows for micky-taking in regards big studio action movies, spoilt actors, bad projects, studio executives and so on  it is never sensible but it is mostly very funny. I think the film doesn't always succeed though because it sort of straddles two stools and those who want one or the other will have reservations while the smaller number who recognise both stools will perhaps see flaws on both. To explain that better I should probably say what I mean rather than referring to furniture and backsides. See as a satire it is undeniably broad and clumsy with the digs being made in clever but still quite obvious ways and you do have plenty of laughs that are knock-about that don't sit with those looking for smart satire. On the other hand you have those who love the silliness of it but don't really "get" it when it is trying to make digs even if they laugh their heads off at a character eating blood in the misunderstanding of it being a special effect. Somehow though it just about works by just going all out for it and things like the racial issues, anti-Semitic stuff etc all hang together sufficiently.

The cast are a big part of making it work. Stiller is solid throughout and works his character as well as he makes fun of him. Downey Jr is very impressive as the deep-method actor who produces the controversy. Black is a necessary evil but at least his character's drug addiction makes him of value within the satire even if his performance is still a fat guy shouting. I liked the support from both Baruchel and Jackson, who held their own alongside the starry cast. The rest of the cast include solid turns from Nolte, Coogan, Maguire (great superhero movie reference), Pollack and others are all in the shadow of a great Tom Cruise who to me is the one we should be talking about when it comes to controversy tightropes. He is always about an inch away from being embarrassingly silly but yet he pulls it off.

Tropic Thunder is not a perfect film by any means. The satire and the knock-about humour don't compliment one another that well but somehow it all works and the majority of the risky moves are pulled off even if it is not quite as clever as it would like to be. To some it will be the stupidest thing they have ever seen, to others  the funniest; the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is enjoyable for it.

No spoilers but I flagged it anyway - there's no "spoiling" what's thoroughly rancid all on its own. Apparently one of the seminar posters who've flooded this film entry with bogus rave reviews found mine "offensive" so I'm having to dumb it down (appropriate to its subject,) and re-post it. Maybe these studio employees a tad thin-skinned. Tsk.

Non-standard disclaimer: I only went to this Golden Turkey shoo-in because my significant other had a friend who said it was funny. Now I want to find out who this friend is and... let's just not go there.

First off, I was never much of a fan of Ben Stiller - he always seemed just...a bit dull - until his "Night at the Museum" won me over. I was really hoping to get a kick out of this, I really was. Unfortunately...

This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I don't say that lightly. Ordinarily I will give points to a film crew just for having created something, even if it's junk, because at least they made an effort. But...no. In this case I'm just baffled. You've got Ben Stiller, Nick Nolte, Robert Downey fresh on the heels of his excellent "Iron Man," the always-pitch-perfect Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, every single one of them turning in flawless acting performances - and STILL you've got one of the all-time worst pools of fermented bat guano ever to stink up a silver screen.

I've said it before, and let me say it again: Hollywood is a sewer. There are no writers left in that town capable of stringing together a cohesive sentence, much less a story with an intelligent premise, admirable characters, an engaging plot or a meaningful theme. They can do lots and lots of fart jokes, impotent profanity, shocking blood-and-guts gore, satire that's unintentionally self-satirizing, and Beavis & Butthead-caliber gross-outs. And that's...about all. I've already expended far more effort in trashing this cinematic excrement than it will ever merit, but I want to warn the unsuspecting. There is a reason why "reality" shows crowd television schedules folks, and that reason is: Hollyweird is utterly devoid of writers with functioning brains. Or maybe it's just the full flowering of the drug resurgence - I seem to remember this same kind of vacant crap about the time Fleegle, Snorky and the boys were making their big splash on the Banana Splitz hour.

What "Tropic Thunder" was trying to accomplish will perhaps remain a mystery forever. It failed as satire, as comedy, as drama, even as mindless action spectacle. The only other burning question is how it ever managed to get into the Top 10 box office. Yeek. 

Avoid at all costs. This is two hours of my life that were essentially stolen from me, and I'm not happy about it.

There's a scene in this film about how to act a moron, but not be moronic. Unfortunately this film is moronically bad, and anybody who thinks it's funny must be a m.... Filled with so-so stars of modern cinema, it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its maleness/action movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon, Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie, but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam - got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny, just a series of apparently good jokes (how Hollywood portrays a black man) totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so, merely repeats the clichés of martial Americanness - Masters of the Universe - where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Ferrell, Carell, Vaughn, Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are so-called slacker nerds triumphing at love, war, drugs and all that jazz - the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! Please can real gag writers get back to the big screen.

Saw this at the Washington, DC screening on the 10th.

And Got Some I did. A comedy that is not Apatow's is refreshing nowadays. A relentless hard R comedy that fuses elements of practically every famous war film ever made. Beginning with trailers a la Grindhouse for every major character was already a sign of a hilarious film. While most of the humor was "funny-but-i'm-not-laughing" the same amount of laugh out loud humor and gags was provided as well, courtesy of mostly Stiller and Downey Jr. Who I wholeheartedly feel - stole the show. I can't say I've ever seen any character like his in a film of this genre, which already I feel will enter the classics. What's refreshing about Thunder is that it's actually original in certain aspects of the storyline; such as when they decide to shoot the film guerilla style in the jungle only to have the director of the film....- I'll leave this at that. A spoof of war films that isn't tireless or idiotic like the recent Epic/Date films... which do not even deserve to be called "spoofs". And be prepared for Cruise, who plays the most radical role of his entire career.

Every now and then a movie comes out that leaves its audience asking how in God's name did this film ever get made? How did the pitch go to its producers ...? Let me see if I've got this straight: You want to make a comedy about some pampered actors making a Vietnam movie who are purposely thrown into an actual confrontation to lend some realism to the operation? Then you see who produced the film -- the actual film -- and then you start to understand: Ben Stiller, the star of the movie -- actual and fictional.

Ugh.

When I was a kid my friends and I would get together in my back yard and shoot comical karate movies with the video camera from the AV department of the school where my Dad taught high school biology. We'd ham it up and watch them over and over again, laughing hysterically each time. But even when I was 13, I knew that the reason these movies were so funny to us was because we were the stars and because we got all the inside humor. One wonders if Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and the assorted other Hollywood A-listers filling the supporting rolls in this film ever knew as much as I did when I was 13. As I looked around at my fellow moviegoers as the credits rolled on 'Tropic Thunder,' watching Tom Cruise on the screen dancing to some rap song and made up to look like a fat, balding typical Hollywood movie producer, I can tell you with the utmost earnestness, they do not. We all sat there in the dark, waiting for the rest of the laughs a movie with such talent available must surely provide, ultimately. But alas, it never did. Maybe 'Tropic Thunder' is funny to people who work in the movie industry, but I wouldn't know because I'm not one of them -- and neither is 99% of the movie-going audience.

Sure there are a few giggles and guffaws here and there, but 'Tropic Thunder,' can never quite make up its mind about what it is. Is it satire or slapstick? It tries for both but achieves neither. Mostly it's just a lot of crude humor and hammed-up bluster.

I'm no expert, but it seems to me satire works best when you can really focus on the material you're sending up and not distract by randomly introducing strange, unique elements to your story. For instance, in what universe would the head of a jungle-dwelling, gun-toting Asian heroin ring be a 10 year old boy? What are you lampooning? Heroin rings? And its weird enough that a movie director would allow his actors to be set up for real danger on the orders of the movie's producer, so you really don't need the author of the book the film's based on to be a fraud, too. We understand some actors go a little nuts and don't break character, but you needn't conjure up some fictional surgical procedure that allows white people to become black to drive that comic point. You keep all the other constants constant, see, so you can focus on the core humor.

And having no core humor is not an excuse -- though that would surely be the one this film's makers would offer if pressed by an angry mob of moviegoers each seeking a refund. If you've seen the TV trailers for this picture, you've already seen much of the few decent one-liners. And watching Stiller once again set himself up to be hilariously humiliated over and over grew tiresome somewhere around the middle of 'Meet the Parents.' Jack Black's comic talents are squandered. Robert Downey Junior never quite delivers as a Russell Crowe type perpetually lost in a Shaft-esquire black militant role he's playing for the movie being made in the story. Uh, yeeaahh ... that's sooooo Russell Crowe. Matthew McConaughey phones in some whacked out Hollywood agent. Nick Nolte forgettably mumbles up the book author role. And Tom Cruise's performance, as the movie producer, is notable mainly for its clumsiness and bad taste.

Things blow up, people blow up, bats are eaten, disgusting, distasteful things happen. There's a lot of tortured movie-about-movies humor that never really gets any traction. But the problem is you never really care about why any of it's happening and that's often the difference between good comedy and bad. It stands to reason clowny things will happen to a bunch of clowns and that's all this movie's characters are ever shown as. Who cares? Staying in and checking the latest stand-up act on Comedy Central's a better bet than dropping your 9 at the theatre on this one.

I went to see this film as I noticed it had Jack Black in it, and I thought he was so funny in things like Empire Records, and School of Rock, (and also in Tenacious D - some of his music vids are superb like Tribute). But then I go and see this and I am seriously let down. I expected Jack Black to be totally off his head proper rock-n-roll style, going in attacking the enemy in a proper rock-n-roll style like he did in School of Rock, but for most of the film Jack is pretending to be a stoned out actor, that can't concentrate on anything but drugs for more than five seconds. There was one or two funny bits in the film, like the Panda scene, the bat scene and the bit where Jack is going cold turkey and is tied to the tree, but the rest of the film was the most boring load of rubbish I've ever seen. All the actors were supposed to be actors from rubbish movies, making a rubbish movie that turns out really good, but this film just makes really good actors look really rubbish. Possibly the worst scene in the whole film was the Forrest Gump bit where they make fun of Forrest Gump, I think that could have been so much funnier if Jack Black had been doing that and it had been about someone who was ADHD, 'cos then Jack Black could really have gone off on one in his usual hypo style. I also found that Forrest Gump section very insulting towards people with disabilities, I have Asperger's and ADHD and found it really poorly done, without any consideration for people watching the film who have learning disabilities.

After seeing this film it certainly has put me off going to see any of Jack Blacks other films.

Having heard and seen the multitude of great reviews for this, my wife and I attended expecting a laugh riot. However, despite what I'd heard, this movie was not remotely funny. I might've chuckled once or twice - my wife made not a peep. The audience we saw it with - in a theater that was about half full - chuckled here and there, though, not consistently and never with the entire crowd.

Frankly, this is a poor film on every level. Setting aside the so-called controversy - Robert Downey in black face! Ben Stiller playing mentally retarded! - what exactly was the point? Lots of big name actors with almost nothing to do - I wonder what attracted Jack Black to this film, as he's left with pretty much nothing to do, except roll around in his underwear. Matthew McConaghey is wasted in the stereotypically slimy agent role and Tom Cruise goes way over the top with his bald hat and fat suit. I've seen comments that this is the movie that's going to revive Cruise's career - my guess is, is that this will be the final nail in the coffin.

When I saw the previews for this, I didn't laugh once, but, I thought 'well, it seems like a funny idea.' But, it's not even an original idea - how many movies have we seen that make fun of spoiled Hollywood actors? Talk about an easy target - and, yet, this movie couldn't even get that right. There's seriously nothing here to recommend, unless you convulse with laughter at the thought of Jack Black making fart sounds. Pathetic.

Believe it or not Ben Stiller was once very funny 

" That's right Theo . In one film with Cameron Diaz " 

You've just given away the punchline so shut up and don't interrupt again . But that sums up Stiller . THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is a double edged sword . Even for someone like myself who is not keen on the comedy genre that film was exceptionally brilliant and for years afterwards everyone looked forward to seeing Stiller in a film that if it was a fraction as funny as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY would still have been a classic comedy . Sadly it didn't happen and by the time TROPIC THUNDER came out audiences had given up on Stiller . This is a great pity because TT is a scathing satire on Hollywood and anyone who classes themselves as a movie fan will love this 

It hits the ground running and we're treated to some smart spoof trailers and the film continues in the same vein where Hollywood is making a Vietnam war epic and the over wrought nature of it is matched by the fact it's over budget and well behind schedule and this is the least of the problems as the cast of method actors are about to be kidnapped by violent bandits .

There's somethings that are recognisable to the satire . Obviously this mock film owes direct references to APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but they go a bit deeper than this . I take it Kirk Lazerus is a hybrid of Russell Crowe and Daniel Day Lewis while substance abuser Jeff Portnoy is inspired by Philip Seymour Hoffman ( Which wouldn't have been evident at the time ) while Stiller's character one time movie Idol whose stardom has almost disappeared might be a direct nod to Tom Cruise . Actually the one possible failing of the film is Cruise in the role of Leo Grossman , the cynical and ruthless studio head . Cruise doesn't do cynical or ruthless and he fails to convince as a heartless philistine anymore than he convinces that's bald and short sighted . This is a small failing and rightfully the film concentrates on the dilemma faced by a mob of method actors stuck in a dangerous situation

Tom Cruise was hilarious, Jack Black was marginally funny and everything else just sucked. I went for a bathroom break during the last 30 min. just to have something else to look at. I LOVE Robert Downey Jr., but his character was so dull it was almost physically painful to watch. And Ben Stiller? Good grief- he needs to drop all Zoolander-ish roles pronto. That's exactly how I would describe his character in this movie- Zoolander get stuck in the jungle. Nick Nolte seemed bland to put it mildly. I'm completely stunned that someone of RBJ Jr's caliber would have anything to do with this movie. He must have lost a bet. To say that he was slumming would be the understatement of the century. At least Tom Cruise proved he can still be funny- and without jumping on couches or punching the air. Save your money.

I must admit I did laugh a lot whilst watching this, but that doesn't make this a good film, or a good comedy for that matter. Imagine if you will, taking someone on a night out with bunch of your old school friends, mates from a sports team that you play in etc. You have a great laugh at all the in jokes and times you spent together, but your guest cannot see the fun because they just weren't there. Maybe one or two of the stories were funny to outsiders, but for the most part unless you are part of that community it all just goes over their heads. 

This is the fundamental problem with Tropic Thunder. I went to see this movie with my wife, and because I work in film production there were many in jokes and nuances that I found funny. I have seen egotistical actors, inexperienced in-over-their-heads directors, crazy crew members, dealt with bizarre studio politics, worked in guerrilla style film making, and shot in unusual and politically unsound regions. Most of the humour in this film relies on the viewer being able to cross reference those experiences with the very exaggerated situations shown here. My wife however, not working in film production missed most of the jokes and came away quite bored with whole experience. Take away the in house laughs and all you are left with is toilet humour, gross out laughs and some send ups of classic Vietnam movies. 

It seems that the film makers really struggle to make humour outside of themselves. For instance the Simple Jack retard story about how an action star tries to win Oscar fame by playing a character with learning difficulties in a very bad movie is supposed to be a satire as to how big movie stars can be out of touch with real life subjects. I don't believe that this is intended to be insensitive and offensive to people with learning difficulties, but unfortunately this plot device is executed so badly and pushed so far that instead of lampooning Hollywood stars as it set out to do, it becomes extremely offensive to the very people it did not intend to offend.

I'm assuming that discovering the drug lord is only child is supposed to be funny, but try explaining that to NGOs who work with the child soldiers in Africa. When you look at the lost childhoods, violence and poverty caused by this issue how can this be funny. This is yet another attempt at humour in this movie that failed to hit its mark. Maybe this was an attempt to highlight the issue of child work / slavery problems, but an R Rated comedy like this is quite clearly the wrong vehicle to make socio-political commentary. The plot would have worked just as well if the drug had been a regular guy, and would have been far less incendiary. 

The references to Apocalypse now, Platoon, Deer Hunter were quite funny. The Chucky send up didn't quite work for me, but at least I saw the joke and I'm sure Child's play fans appreciated it. Again these were movie in jokes, that relied on the viewer previously seeing the movie that it was sending up, but at least these could be appreciated by anyone who had seen these particular films.

All in all unless you have experience in the movie business there are few laughs to be had with Tropic Thunder. This film is really up Hollywood's own anus. Movies are meant to be enjoyed by all. $150,000,000 of the general public's hard earned cash spent at the box office on a film that generates laughs for only movie insiders is quite irresponsible.

I was lucky enough to see what they said was the first public showing of this movie to a test audience on February 19th in Phoenix AZ. Security was tight, lots of metal detector wands, airport type security walk through, ladies purses inspected, no cell phones allowed in. They want to make sure no one is filming or taking snapshots of the movie. It is very funny, Ben Stiller is the star and is a fiction action star with lots of films to his credit. While filing in Vietnam they stumble into a war with drug lords who think they are DEA. Stiller and cast believe there are hidden cameras and they are still in production making their epic film. Tom Cruise also stars and when he appeared I told my wife there is Tom Cruise, at the end of the movie she said which one was Tom Cruise? Go figure, he is not playing the Tom we know and love from Top Gun. As the first test audience we answered questions about the movie and some viewers were selected for a discussion panel afterwards. This should appeal to Ben's fans as well as anyone wanting a laugh filled evening.

I went to the movies a couple of weeks ago with my best friend Rick, to see this and Death Race. We both had wanted to see this from watching the previews and promotions; Death Race was his idea. I had no interest in watching a movie that resembles Twisted Metal. Anyways, long story short, I ended up loving Death Race and hating Tropic Thunder. Seeing it last was a mistake too. I was falling asleep. My complaints for this movie is that it's made out to be soooo goddamn funny and it's not. It has some good jokes here and there (mostly by RDJ) but it's not a comedy treasure. That quote from the trailer after the movie came out, "You'll Be Quoting This Movie Forever", is seriously wrong. It should say, "You Will Be Quoting RDJ's Lines Forever". Also, Jack Black, who I usually like and I think is funny, sucked in this movie. He barely does anything in the movie or help it progress. It was a waste to have him in it. I'm a big fat guy--I could have been in the movie as his character and it would be the same thing! Ben Stiller, who gets a lot of flack, was okay in this. Although the Simple Jack thing was a little funny (when they show the trailer) it became really annoying. I am also disabled but it didn't offend me. I just figured, if this is the best they can do, then maybe I'm not so disabled after all. This is surprisingly a movie that you should wait till it comes out on DVD. Not worth the $8.50; not worth all the hype...

These past few years we've had a few comedies come out where it does make fun of what Hollywood is today, but they're usually average and get a couple laughs. We now have Tropic Thunder, this movie is a parody of today's Hollywood with random actors in a big movie and succeeds so well with non stop laughs and fun actors. Tropic Thunder is so well put together and was a perfect spoof of the method actor, the comedian, the rapper, and the action star together in a movie, not to mention Tom Cruise, who knew this guy could be so funny? I mean in a movie; but it seems like he had an absolute blast making this movie, everyone looked liked they were having fun and Ben Stiller really did a great job, this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this summer. Coming here on IMDb there were a lot of haters who were just trashing Rober Downey, Jr. and calling this film so racist, after they see this movie, I'm sure their mouths will be shut, because he was the greatest part of Tropic Thunder.

Tugg Speedman, the action star, Jeff Portnoy, the comedian, Alpa Chino, the rapper, Kevin Sandusky, the "and introducing" actor, and Kirk Lazarus, the method five time award winning actor. These stuck up egotistic actors/wanna-be's are starring in the new big budget Veitnam War movie, but it's not going so well with these guys who can't seem to get motivated. So the director and author of the book "Tropic Thunder" take them out to the real jungle of Vietnam, the guys still think they are doing the movie, but what they don't know is that they are being attacked by real terrorists, way to get motivated.

Tropic Thunder is seriously one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while, I miss these comedies where the humor is the kind that is just a spoof of real life people. Hollywood today is incredibly ridicules when you think about it and Tropic Thunder just makes you laugh about it. Without a doubt Robert Downey, Jr. stole the show with his controversial character, "the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude", going from a white Aussie to a hard core black man, he actually had me convinced, maybe he should be nominated for an Oscar, lol, just kidding, but he was great. Ben Stiller has redeemed himself very much, he hasn't made me laugh so hard since Zoolander. Jack Black was also incredibly funny, I loved his hard core addiction to heroin and how it drove him crazy. I highly recommend this movie, it was so much fun to watch and is guaranteed to have you laughing like crazy.

This is one of those movies that you will be quoting for the rest of your life with your friends! Tropic Thunder is a great satire that I was honestly expecting to be terrible. 

The story was actually perfect to make fun of action movies and Hollywood. The situational comedy was genius as these actors were forced to actually survive a war like setting. The action scenes themselves resembled really action movies and were nicely done. They added the action in with the hilarity, and all of it worked perfectly.

There were two characters that really stand out. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise were both comedic gold! You won't recognize either of them, but they fit the roles fantastically. Some people find Downey's character to be inappropriate, but please take it for what it is supposed to be. Downey Jr was making fun of method acting and taking that concept to a completely new level with this role. I didn't realize Tom Cruise was in this until the credits. He is in a role that I never thought I would see him in. He is outrageous and over the top. His scenes are some of the most memorable from the movie.

I don't want to give too much away since I don't want to spoil any of the comedic gold. Just know that you will be kept laughing the entire time, and the movie will just keep getting better. This is a great watch and definitely worth your time; 8/10.

Tropic Thunder is full of all the satires of big Hollywood stereotypes. The action star, the method actor, and the comedian who relies on farts and nothing else. Staff Sergeant John "Four Leaf" Tayback's (Nick Nolte) memoir "Tropic Thunder" is being made into a movie. Action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), drug addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), and newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) are the stars of the film. Because the film is running on a tight schedule and risks being shut down by producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is forced to drop Tugg, Kirk, Jeff, Alpa, and Kevin in the middle of the Vietnamese jungle to shoot the movie guerrilla style. But strange things go on and eventually the actors are forced to act like real soldiers. Tropic Thunder is a load of fun. All the jokes are funny and it's so satisfying with a bunch of quotable moments. It's not a movie for everyone but for those are not easily offended, you will have a blast.

Apparently, Ben Stiller met actors who were in Platoon and talked about it like they'd been to war, and that struck him as ridiculous and many years later, he helped turn that thought into a war movie.

Tropic Thunder is basically a self-aware action-comedy, a satire on the vanity of movie actors. Its easy to misjudge it, I've found. On first viewing, I just didn't think there were enough jokes. Its a strange animal because it has its feet equally in the action and comedy camps. Its almost as much about becoming the thing, as it is about satirising it. The movie I think is interesting in the way it pushes through the meta stuff to get to some kind of reality. It would make a good introductory text for a class on the nature of truth and reality, if not for how easily misunderstood its dialogue about race and disability groups are. While its clear to me that the intention is to make fun of movie actors at all times, I can understand how some people might have felt the movie was irresponsible in its messages with the "Simple Jack" storyline and the blackface storyline. 

I know Downey Jr. was conflicted about accepting the role of a method actor who gets so immersed in his role as a black seargent that he can't drop character, but I'm glad he did accept it, because he's hilarious. He steals every scene he's in. As does Tom Cruise, who many didn't recognise until the closing credits, back in the day. Some of the team players get forgotten. Jay Baruschel is an excellent straight-man. He's the character we relate to, the one actor who hasn't been swallowed up by vanity. Jack Black also has a bit of a thankless job. He's unpleasant as the Fatties star, unpleasant as the drug addict, and has one hilarious scene when he's tied up to the tree. Steve Coogan also has an important part, and he plays it well. 

Back in 2008, I was expecting maybe Zoolander or Anchorman, which have maybe 50% more jokes. Tropic Thunder is a different animal. Its a bit more measured, but its way more exciting and immersive than any of the other over the top comedies it gets lumped along with.

This film is arguably one of the best comedies of the 2000's. Ben Stiller after having a lull in his career came back strong with Tropic Thunder. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. The cast for the movie was spot on. It brought back Jack Black back to the spot light and allowed juggernauts Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise to give iconic performances.

The plot of Tropic Thunder is that it's a movie about a movie. A group of actors set out to make a big budget Viet Nam film. However, they end up being put in the thick of a drug zone that forces the group to assume the roles they are playing. 

Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an actor who use to be hot and now finds himself trying to save his career as leader of the team. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) is an Australian with multiple Academy Awards who undergoes pigment surgery to play his role. With the addition of Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) as the rest of the team they set out to make movie history. 

This film was nominated for one Oscar. It went to Robert Downey Jr. While this was the only Oscar it was nominated for it could have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Since the Academy doesn't often nominate comedies it didn't happen. 

That aside the film is a work of genius. I have watched this movie year after year and still find it funny as I did that day in the theaters. Tropic Thunder gives you a chance to laugh at the Hollywood depiction of making a movie and gives you the chance to appreciate the talent that went into some of the performances. All together this film is just a great chance to let yourself laugh and have a good time.
