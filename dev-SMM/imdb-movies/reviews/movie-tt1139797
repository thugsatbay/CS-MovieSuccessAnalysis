### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Let the Right one In is like no other vampire movie that I have ever seen. It is smarter, scarier and more nuanced. It doesn't feel like a thriller, it feels like literature.

The film, which details the bizarre misadventures of a pair of pre-teen star crossed lovers, one of whom is an androgynous vampire, is phenomenal in almost every regard. The details of young Oskar's (Kare Hedebrant) life are spot on. Stuck in that incredibly painful period of post-childhood, pre-adolescence, Oskar is aware of girls, but has no idea how to contend with them. He is small for his age and is brutalized by other boys as a result. He's terribly alone and collects news clips of violent crimes as a way of letting out his rage. One day a strange young girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) appears on the playground. They become fast friends and things begin to look up for Oskar. Eli even (innocently) spends the night on occasion.

Meanwhile, we are privy to some things that Oskar doesn't know. As it happens, Eli's caretaker is a serial killer of the most brutal order, desanguinating his victims into a bucket. Soon, Oskar comes to realize that his new friend is a bit more than she seemed at first.

After a tragedy of shocking violence Eli is left to fend for herself, trying desperately to stave off the urge to drink fresh blood while also forming a delicate new bond with Oskar.

There is already a remake of Let the Right one In on the way. But don't wait for it. There is no way it could ever hope to capture the magic of the original. It's not just that this film is gorgeously shot. Not just that it is impeccably written. Not just that it is fully realized with an unmatched respect for vampire lore. It is all in the acting. Even if the producers find two amazing young actors, the odds against recapturing the brilliant, melancholy chemistry are astronomical.

Everything about Let the Right one In is thought through. Where a more traditional horror film might have opted for endless ultra violence or else cut everything out in favor of a kiddie friendly rating. director Tomas Alfredson steers the line right down the middle. When the violence comes it is brutal and horrific, but it is never dwelt upon. We are left to question what we just saw rather than see kidneys on display.

Too, there is a great stillness to the film. The first half of the film it mimics Oskar's stage. Stuck in between. Never moving, with no hope of growth. But as things begin to change, it becomes apparent that the stillness is not for Oskar but rather for Eli. Oskar will grow up, change and become a man. Eli is stuck in a much more burdensome fate.

And then there is the quiet, understated ending. Some will find it haunting, others will find it whimsical, I went back and forth more than a few times. No two people will have the same understanding.

This is the kind of movie people beg for. Don't miss it. This is the first time since perhaps Silence of the Lambs that a horror film had a real chance to take home some Oscar gold. And not only that, it will deserve it.

"Let the Right One In" is, at its heart, a sweet coming-of-age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies categorization. In this Swedish film, adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestselling book, director Tomas Alfredson dares to mix pleasure and pain in a way that is both horrifying and tender.

"Let the Right One In" has a storyline which, although it reveals some secrets early on, is best left as a surprise. So this will necessarily be one of those rare reviews in which the less said about the plot the better. 12-year-olds Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and Eli (Lina Leandersson) meet one snowy afternoon at a jungle gym in the courtyard of Oskar's housing complex outside Stockholm. Their young, tender attraction for each other is apparent right from the start and we think we know where their relationship is headed. But there is a deep dark secret to be discovered here and when it's revealed the audience is both repulsed and curiously fascinated at the same time, in a similar fashion as when yellow crime scene tape brings us closer rather than warning us away.

The supporting cast is completely beholden to the narrative as it revolves around the adorable young couple, whose performances rival the best I've ever seen for actors of that age. The innocence and vulnerability of Hedebrant's Oskar is simply a tour-de-force and he admirably carries the film on his little shoulders. Leandersson matches him scene by scene, line by line, and the result literally gave me chills.

Production values are stellar, with all technical aspects -- lighting, original music by Johan Soderqvist, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography -- combining in perfect synchronization to produce a Hitchockian tale that somehow brings love and light into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable.

"Let the Right One In" was the overwhelming choice for Best Narrative Feature after its North American Premiere here at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. It is a truly well-deserved honor. Tomas Alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder.

Tomas Alfredson's "Let The Right One In" is an original, dark, twisted and gory horror fantasy, one of those special films that are hard to classify. Not merely an exercise in style, his film is a brilliant piece of amoral storytelling, and even if some characters' actions defy any logic or common sense (I don't wanna spoil any moment here, but you'll know what I mean when the first revenge moment of the story happens), they seem to be there just to remind you that this is just a fantasy tale (but not for the little ones!). Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is a 12 year-old bullied boy that befriends and develops an innocent crush on his new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), who happens to be a vampire. What comes next is a twisted tale of revenge and pubescent love, made with visual flair (the swimming pool scene is already classic), creative directing and impressive performances by the young pair of protagonists.

Hollywood, of course, didn't waste time and already announced an upcoming remake for those who are too lazy to read subtitles. Most likely, the remake will turn out to be PG-13 in order to make more money, and be filled with moral values so the prudish parents will let their kids watch the movie (don't they know "The Little Vampire" was made years ago?). Ignore the future bomb and enjoy the original - you're in for a treat! 10/10.

I am not particularly fond of the vampire genre, but this movie is so much more. It is artistic, poetic, and in many ways a very profound movie exploring the nature of good and evil. It does so through the world of a child where both pure evil and pure goodness are somewhat discernible, and it achieves an astounding array of contrasts that allow us to see that good and evil can coexist side by side. Doing so, this movie is very thought-provoking, leaving the audience yearning to read the novel. In short, this movie is a gem. There is no need to remake this movie which according to IMDb.com they will be. You don't need to wait until 2010, you should watch this movie now.

I have watched both Twilight and Let the Right one in.

I strongly feel that Let the Right outruns Twilight on almost EVERY SINGLE ASPECT, except, of course, advertisement, due to the inequality of budgets. (a Swedish director vs a Hollywood one, come on...) If Twilight is no more than an idol gallery under the skin of vampire horror, Let the Right one in is such a film that completely redefines people's perception on traditional vampire horrors.

There aren't many gory scenes or special visual impacts, unlike Twilight being fraught with computer generated scenes. Plus, the pace of Let the Right is slow, without many exaggerations. Yet, the audience could feel the profound impact of the film within, an impact that totally transcends cheap sensory stimuli, while exerting a quiet yet POWERFUL "shake" upon people's soul.

I felt very upset that an American remake will be done next year. From our common sense, we could deduct how the remake would be compared to the original. Before the remake ruins the story, do yourself a favour watching the originals!!!

If you feel yourself mentally more mature than 15 y.o., go watch Let the Right on in instead of Twilight. You will NOT regret your choice.

I saw this movie yesterday at the official premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival in Holland. I didn't know anything beforehand, and i was blown away. The film is a strange mix; it includes romantic elements, horror. Kisses and love, but also blood and death. And it's told in a straightforward manner, as if this all was very normal and like every film is made like this.

I don't wanna give too much away, but in involves falling in love with a vampire. Highly original.

Beautiful style and cinematography. Every shot was gorgeous. Shame about the music, which was too attention grabbing and melodramatic. 

The child actors were very good. Also in the minor parts. 

I never before saw a child covered with blood. And kissing. And yes, it's disturbing sometimes, but no, this is no exploitation. It's heartfelt and beautiful. I don't know the book on which this is based. Probably, if you're from Sweden, know the book and envisioned it for yourself, it will be different.

I saw it in Bangkok International Film Festival 2008 and love this movie very much.

It has something big and stunning about this lovely storyline to rivet my attention from the beginning to the end. Moreover, the cinematography and atmosphere in this film are undeniably superb. The chemistry between two preteen protagonists is outstanding and very believable. Everything in this film is well-made in synchronization. 

This is the first film related to a vampire that I think is least connected to Vampire's teeth baring at audience all the times, like other familiar horror we used to see. Other than some gory scenes in this film, we can yet see some flesh and blood moment of humane Vampire. And that is truly written to the core plot.

The last scene at swimming pool is totally mesmerizing and mind-blowing.

By the way, if Sweden submits this movie to be in competition with other nominees around the world for Oscar foreign-language film category this year, this masterpiece should win or at least be short-listed for the final fives.

I saw several movies at the Seattle International Film Festival this year, and Let the Right One In was by far my favorite of the bunch. It's primarily a movie about how friendship can help you find your own personal strength. Two lonely children meet and change each other's lives. The fact that one is a vampire makes the movie even more interesting and unique, but it's not the most important plot detail. The cold darkness of Sweden makes the perfect backdrop for the story. It was so refreshing to see a vampire movie that doesn't rely upon cheap scares, fangs and gore. The only scene I didn't enjoy involved cats with computer animated faces - it looked very stupid and out of place, but this was a small disappointment in an otherwise outstanding film. I highly recommend this movie.

This movie is good.

The story is simple enough. A lonely boy, Oskar, befriends the girl next door, Eli, and with her help overcomes the school bullies.

But then there is so much more going on. There is a serial killer, who seems to pick on very cute adolescent boys and has a strange jealousy towards the Oskar. And there is a vampire who can only survive on blood. And there are some sexual undertones.

But all of it just helps a great story get told. The horror is well done and appropriate. The actors are all just right for their parts. The horror is always lurking round the corner and there to let you know that the world is a hard place even if the story we see is kind of funny or fantastical.

There are some mysteries everyone can figure out for themselves and the answers just add layers to this story that make it even better. Just remember what Eli says about what she is and take it to its logical conclusion.

A must see! On a side note, it is great to see the Vampire "rules" all upheld, of course the title itself refers to the rule that a vampire can only enter a home when he is invited in.

This film was the main reason for my attending Frightfest in London this year and I was not disappointed. From the opening shot you realise that you are in for something special. The film is set in (a very cold) Sweden in the early 1980s and the writer of the novel/screenplay has confessed that it is semi-autobiographical and based loosely on his own childhood. I'm guessing that the inclusion of a vampire in the story is what takes this away from being simply autobiographical.

Although people are describing this as a vampire movie, I cannot help but feel that this does the film something of a disservice. Does this mean that people who do not particularly like vampire movies would not necessarily go to the cinema and watch this? That would be a shame because this is a very human story. The vampire element does take a back seat to the main focus of the story which is the fascinating relationship between Oscar and Eli. These are two outcasts brought together by their miserable lives.

The film is Swedish with subtitles but again don't let that put you off. The two performances by the child actors are fantastic and director Alfredson is apparently better known for comedy in Sweden and his humour is evident throughout the film. Without a doubt the best film at Frightfest 2008, there is a remake planned for 2010 but the film is near perfect just as it is so why wait? Go and see it.

At it's worst "Let the Right One In" is far too subtle and slow and nothing like typical horror movies, (if it should be considered one.) At its best its one of the better films we've seen in the last decade. As a foreign film it should see wider American distribution and publicity than any such film since"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." 

Our hero here, who is just twelve, is so perfectly likable and so well played he is the sort of boy you'd want to raise, or the sort you'd want your child to end up with. He's richly contemplative and caring, lonely, but not broken, cool, but not pretentious, precocious and yet without arrogance. Who knew that he would fall for a vampire? 

It's a story more like "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" than " The Lost Boys." It's more about asceticism and existentialism than blood and gore. I won't give any details away, but this film is neither convoluted nor cliché. Sure, it's not amongst the best stories. It's not a formula film, but it's intelligently written and doesn't start anything it doesn't conclude, (well not too much). 

Beautifully shot in a snowy and desolate Swedish town, the film very much carries on a world of its own. The film as an entirety is subtle, even slow. Likewise the effects are far from showy, making tasteful use of CGI with kitties or watching our vampire climb seven stories. 

The sound does not rely on a creepy score, nor attempts a hip or ambient soundtrack. Instead, it successfully amplifies the sounds of its fictional and isolated universe, (which is far away from reality and amid somewhere in the early 1980s.) For the most part we only hear what the characters or the world around them, gusts of wind, the brushing of teeth, The Clash. Though most notable is all of the silence, all of the stillness that creeps about keeping the viewer mystified and engaged.

What the film does is allow adequate time for the viewer to develop a consciousness about the situation of the story. It allows us to make our own determinations without being told what to conclude. Throughout the entire movie I could only count one legitimate flaw, a tiny divisive issue, which I'm sure was mulled over by a brilliant director and screenwriter. 

It certainly won't be for everyone. It's not for those who can't read. It's not for kids. And it's not for those who can't bear non-traditional story telling. For me, the film was a breath of fresh air in an increasingly tiring and rehashed film industry. At least this film is rehash of a different kind.

This film should have seen a slew of Oscar nods and it seemed to me this film could have had a wide release. Nevertheless it will turn out to be a classic.

So many people reviewing this film on IMDb seem to focus on the sweet friendship between it's 12 year old human and vampire leads. While this is a huge element of the film, this is a sweet story of childhood friendship in the same way 'The Godfather' is the story of a fathers concerns and worries for his kids; both true descriptions, its just that you would be missing the point if you came away from either film thinking that is what you had seen.

In truth, 'Let the right one in' is about as dark a film as you can get, and its a measure of its brilliant story telling that having seen it a week ago, its disturbing echoes have stayed with me and refuse to go away.

It's also one of those films best enjoyed without prior knowledge, but impossible to review properly without disclosing plot elements, so be warned - SPOILERS AHEAD.

As another comment here has said, it's the character Håkan that is the key to this story; for at the end of the film we are led to believe Oskar is stepping into his place. It is that fact, revealed in the final scene that gives the film its dark and nightmarish core; the blossoming friendship we have been witness to prior to this will offer no redemption to Oskar if this is path his relationship with Eli takes.

Håkan butchers boys not much older than Oskar as food for Eli. In this story, where the storytelling is of the highest order so many of its darkest whispers are just that, hinted and suggested at. Questions are alluded to that play on the mind, but are never answered. Why does Håkan pick these victims ? presumably they are Eli's preference. What does that say about Eli's interest in Oskar ? What is Eli's true nature ? She has been twelve "for a very long time", but we briefly glimpse her true physical age, in fact she is in late middle age; roughly the same age as Håkan. Her gift to Oskar in the films last moments; the brutal slaughter of his child tormentors. Entranced in her glamour, this makes Oskar happy, but how can this be happy or good ?

And then they go off happily into the sunset, Oskar presumably to be deadened to the soul destroyed husk of a person Håkan had become, butchering his fellow humans to provide Eli with food. You can see why I am puzzled when people think this film is sweet. In fact its conclusion is utterly chilling; Oskar has happily swapped the commonplace misery of childhood bullying for a fate that will truly be hell on earth and you know as he happily smiles in the films last shot that he doesn't have a clue.

None the less, it's superlative and a film I would heartily recommend. Like the greatest horror tales it succeeds by suggestion and playing on the imagination. It is also a truly great addition to the vampire cannon, a thing that can be said of very few variations on Bram Stokers brilliant original.

I read the book and loved it. Now, I had the chance to see the movie version at the Gothenburg International Filmfestival 2008, as the movie won the "Nordiska filmpriset". I saw it at a really big screen (700 seats), happy that it delivered fine acting and quality cinema.

Having said that, I'd also agree with what's been said (e.g. above) that the music is a bit over the top. The movie itself is a study in the small: tiny nuances in the classroom and schoolyard, the almost forgotten suburb, the hiding qualities of snow, ice and winter (not to mention the, at least partly, neglected kids). To score such small details with grand strings makes for a bit of a mismatch. Enough on that, some parts have only piano and those work perfectly.

Witout spoiling anything it's safe to say that this first and foremost is a story of friendship. Second, it's a story of revenge. Either way, this is a truly original tale and in many parts a beautiful piece of cinema. Original (and sometimes quite gory) still even the violence seems subdued (at least in comparison to the vampire genre as it has evolved from subtle romance flick to full blown war movie). This movie, however, is about loneliness, friendship and loyalty --- and it's really worth watching. Recommended.

I had just finished reading the book when i went to see this movie. I had big expectations, which i didn't want to have because than you can get disappointed, but oh my god was i happy when it was even better than i expected. Every second of the movie is just brilliant film-making, thanks to Tomas Alfredson who has proved that he is a master. Also the acting is great and believable, and the cinematography and music is beautiful. There was some things that i missed from the book that wasn't in the movie, but i expected that. This movie is a masterpiece and every single human being should see it. Well perhaps not every singe one since this is a horror movie, don't see it with your young ones.

This review may be seen as containing spoilers  I don't think it does but a warning just in case. Be wary of genre classifications here: to call this a mere vampire film without qualification would be a disservice. A vampire film it is, but one that belongs to a very select club. Midway through, I imagined the ghosts old Bela and Tod Browning hobnobbing with a Mr Bergman, all three of them living up every moment of this elegant little tale of horror. With minimal special effects, no flashy editing and cinematography that leaves its imprint on your mind for days, Alfredson's layered film about cruelty and goodness, exclusion and marginality  for both vampire and human alike  is told through the unlikely friendship of two 12-year-old loners. One, Oskar, albino-like in his white blondness, is bullied at school. The other, Eli, a dark, unkempt and unorthodox girl vampire, teaches him to stand up for himself. In the background is the strange, devoted, slightly bumbling Hakan, Eli's human protector and blood gatherer. He strings his victims up, cuts them open then siphons their blood into jerricans for Eli to drink. He passes as her father. (Is he?)

The film has a strong physical impact. The fatigue and drudgery (and anguish) of Hakan's attempts to find refurbishment; the confinement of Eli's agelessness ("I have been 12 for a long time"); the isolation of the dreary suburban setting in the dead of a Swedish winter  all of these are as palpable as the burden of eternity felt by Wenders' two angels watching over Berlin. The film's cadence is that of a macabre Bolero: slow and tame at the beginning, but relentlessly progressing, louder and louder until the film starts to explode in a series of horrific scenes towards the end. 

Troubling questions left unresolved only add to the film's richness and depth. Eli's labia stitched shut, her relationship with her protector. Why does he kill in her place?  because she is young?  to avoid a proliferation of vampires? When Eli finally has to find her own blood, thus turning a bitten woman into a vampire herself, the sequences that follow  the cat attack, willed self-destruction  are some of the most striking in the film, frightening enough to make your heart skip a thump. There are two "endings". Alfredson lures us into a false one when he circles the film back to a scene almost identical to that at the opening. But then he playfully tacks on another 10 or 15 minutes in a very different tone. At first this rattled me a bit, but then I came to better terms with it and decided that after all, its black humour was far from a cop out. Reviewers have predicted the film will have a solid festival and art house audience. Personally, I cannot imagine any kind of film-goer not being dazzled by this icy trip through bloodied woods, and where, according to the many reactions to the film, a light "supposedly" shines through. It does and doesn't. The film may be about friendship but the relief provided by the ending is only an isolated moment in time that has resolved nothing. The future that one is left to imagine for the survivors is disturbing at best.

"Let the right one in" is just a very huge surprise and a plain beautiful movie. You can always judge how much impact a movie has when you watch the crowd in the cinema while the credits roll and in this one barely anyone dared to stand up and go... I guess they were all busy swallowing their tears because this movie is a real tearjerker.

The movie is a unique mix of a vampire movie with love story and drama. The story is told in a very slow style but this just fits the story about two kids who meet at night on a playground. One is the introvert outsider Oskar who gets bullied at school and has a strange interest for knives and murder stories and the other is Eli, a girl that just moved in next door to him with what we expect is her dad. Immediately when they tape the windows shut with cardboard and dad goes out at night knocking out boys to drain their blood into a bottle we know that Eli is not an ordinary child but rather a vampire that sleeps at day and only comes out at night and like she tells Oskar has been 12 years old for a very long time. From here on the relationship between the two deepens while some cracks appear between Eli and her "dad" who fails at providing her with blood. When Elis Dad dies after trying to find a victim for Eli she is left on her own and soon the small town finds dead people in the snow. The story how Eli became what she is now is not through flashbacks but rather through a woman that is bitten by her and survives, turning into a vampire herself. The classic vampire movie elements were used in a very unique way, especially the title-giving invitation to come in. The use of special effects in this movie is brilliant ... like when the cats turn against a vampire when sensing it or the short and rough final scene when Oskar is dunked under water. Basically the story deals with the old sad story of the curse of immortality and how everything withers around the vampire except for himself. But the way this is placed in a children's environment and how Eli approaches Oskar is special. In the end the viewer is left to judge on his own... is this a heartbreaking love story, is Eli using Oskar or is it both as a natural way that life demands of their fate? When thedramatic piano music fades on you are sure thinking about this and inthat way the movie is great, subtle and different. The acting especially of the 2 lead children is great and the casting for Eli is beyond perfect because she has something hypnotic in her eyes that captures a lot of her character by the first time she appears on screen. I guess this is a movie not to be missed, no matter if you like vampire movies or not... this should appeal to anyone in a way.

A major issue with horror films is their inherently being trapped in some corner of the genre. Vampire films are to a degree less prone to this because they are almost always based in relationships. Their power at times depends on the quality shown in these relationships developing, both human and not.

From the moment this film steps from the eerie softness of the snowfall, you know you may see something different if not extraordinary. This tranquility subsists throughout as you observe the evolution of one of the most interesting and provocative relationships you will ever witness in film. The subtlety and, yes, beauty of this truly throws you off bearings of any expectation.

Then suddenly, in context of genre, horror explodes that both redefines and extends the vampire myth. Most importantly, it scares the crap out of you.

The motion between these two moods really moves your emotions in ways you have not often experienced, almost never in a fright fest. Innocent sweetness. Sick pleasure in revenge. Longing remembrance of first love. Amazement at so simple special effects. An almost tear inspiring bloody kiss. Many others.

It all works because of the wonderful story, amazing performances from two first time actors, cinematography that rivals that seen in Bergman, and direction that drives this amazing sense of continuity.

I recently saw this film at a festival in Sarasota, FL. 28 films in seven days. I've Loved You So Long, The Wrestler, Waltz With Bashir, Slumdog Millionaire, The Class among them. This film was far and away my favorite and will end up somewhere in my favorite five for the year. I think that many film snobs like me who see this will be shocking themselves as they compile their personal end of year lists. Maybe end of year awards, particular considering the expectations of a genre that seldom delivers anywhere near the beauty you witness here.

Not convinced yet you MUST see this film and not the likely beyond pathetic US remake already in the works. Any film that can have you weeping at closure with the decision by an innocent yet likely sociopathic little boy running away to facilitate the life of a timelessly young, lonely, and vicious vampire has taken you to a place almost sacred. Go there.

In a nutshell, the movie is not about vampires at all. Yes there is violence but it is the kind of violence which is comes across as an absolute necessity. It often feels that the violent scenes are almost apologetic in nature. This is a movie about life, love and everything in between. The movie is very "crisp" and focused with every emotion being "sharpened" by the age of its characters, the cinematography and pureness of the actors portrayal of their characters.

All of the other reviews already mention the plot so by now you probably have a good idea of what the movie has in store for you.

I just wanted to draw your attention to one detail that i have not seen mentioned in any of the reviews. I think this one detail gives the movie its greatest depth: Eli's (Eli is the old vampire trapped in the never-aging body of a 12 year old girl) caretaker is seen by many as a serial killer or maniac which brutally slays young boys. He drains the blood of his victims and delivers it to Eli.

I think everyone is dead wrong here. Eli's caretaker is the "key" to the whole story. He is clearly in love with her. He clearly hates murdering people but at the same time clearly hates to see Eli suffer without blood or doing the killing herself. He sacrifices himself for her.

Who is he? He is a man who once fell in love as a young boy. Just like Oskar (the young boy who finds friendship, support and live in Eli). Perhaps he too at his young age found Eli a friend, a savior and his first and only true love. Perhaps he couldn't see her murder people for blood and he decided to take care of her just like she took care of him when he couldn't stand up for himself.

When he is caught, he can not bare the shame. First he disfigures his own face not to allow authorities to link him to Eli and then he ends his own life, knowing well that his time has ended and that Eli has found a new life and a new friend. Before his death he gives Eli his last gift - his own blood.

Understanding this detail we understand the movie's ending. Oskar takes the place as the right one who now will take care of Eli until the day he dies as she continues to live on.

Film critics (and aspiring amateur pretenders) never cease to amaze me. They love nothing more than laying into "dumb" Hollywood productions for a lack of plausibility yet consistently let foreign productions off the hook for the very same mistakes. Many called this quiet little Swedish film a masterpiece. You have got to be kidding me? Let me see now, if this was a Michael Bay production do you think they'd overlook these corkers? Read on.....

Eli has a guardian figure who murders innocents and collects their blood. You get the impression Eli and him have been around for quite some time. This moron decides to abduct and murder a young man yards from a main road. His attempts to extract blood consist of a funnel and a makeshift bucket. It's so idiotic it's embarrassing. Naturally he's spotted and has to bolt. We then see him sitting on a train holding his waterproofs which are splattered with blood. In full view of everyone. Unbelievable. This clown wouldn't last a week in this line of work.

It gets worse. This same philistine decides to try again. This time in a SCHOOL. Yup, you read that right. He hangs a lad upside down in the changing room, primed for throat slitting, bucket at the ready. He doesn't even gag the boy. What happens? The boy has friends waiting for him outside and he starts SHOUTING for help. Mr Murderer really is as dumb as they come right? This time he's cornered. Solution? Pours acid on his face so the police won't recognise him and garner a lead to Eli! Hahaha. Masterpiece right?!!

Not only that, if you're going to murder people for blood why not just let Eli feed there and then? Why wander around with waterproofs, funnels and buckets when she can just come along??! It's so dumb it hurts.

There's more. There are dead bodies dropping left and centre. We even have a man witness Eli maul his friend. Yet there is no discernible police investigation, no one reports anything to anyone. The stupidity of every character is mind boggling.

A local woman is attacked and infected by Eli. She survives but is now a vampire. She and her husband both know full well who attacked her. The young, creepy looking girl who stays just over there! Yet they tell no one. She's never interviewed and her husband doesn't crack a light to anyone. He has his own little revenge mission which also ends in complete and utter farce. No surprise there.

Oskar's relationship with his dad is never fleshed out and has absolutely no bearing on the film at all. Why was it even in there? Another mystery not explained.

We see Oskar at the end heading to pastures new with Eli in a box. Haha, another belter. I'm sure his mum was happy to just let her 12 year old boy leave home, no questions asked. Perhaps he's fled of his own accord? On a PUBLIC train! One call to the authorities and he'd be picked up at the very next station. It's so stupid it's borderline offensive.

I could go on, really I could. Here we have a film where the characters commit the same cardinal sins which normally have critics rolling their eyes in disdain. Yet they turned a blind eye this time. Don't be fooled. This is not a masterpiece in a million years.

Thematically rich "Låt Den Rätte Komma In" hits refresh on the vampire genre with an interesting outlook on character and its development. Casting is accurate although out, as even with the sinister events, performances are played with such convincing skill that its subtext is never overshadowed. Generally moody and calm on its almost 2 hour running time, audiences will be spellbound if not disinterested.

Film follows the empathetic and anemic looking Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant); desperate for friends and also revenge on bullies who mistreat him in school. Main protagonist eventually meets with the mysteriously charismatic Eli (Lina Leandersson) who slowly unravels herself as a character of the dark. Events transpire that further cements an unlikely friendship of sorts, leading to a very bloody finale. The film is no doubt not for the squeamish as even with the abundance of tender scenes between Oskar and Eli, violence is still undeniably present which is depicted in either a repulsive or comedic light.

Archaic monsters have always been an allegory towards a more imminent threat, like Romania's Dracula for Eastern Europeans immigrating to Western Europe, threatening the economy. In Tomas Alfredson's modern twist, Eli's fangs are treated as if it were of biological origins, which need a treatment that may pose morality questions. Her paternal figure becomes the film's tragic core as he emphasizes the depressing lengths he would go through to sustain Eli's thirst for blood. Although played as if he was paternal, further reveals later would show his function was to foreshadow the main protagonist's future removed from this micro cosmos.

Also interesting is Alfredson's play on the sexual identification of the creature. All femmes become fatales in one way or another, whilst male characters turn into almost bathetic who are never snapped out of a hypnotic spell. Also seen in Almodovar's "Hable Con Ella", technique adds a level of sophistication to the proceedings and further enriches their characterizations.

As with old Hollywood's Dracula, Eli is perfectly portrayed by Lina Leandersson as she not so much carry the entire film, but devours the role. Shiny eyes not seen since Puss in Boot's "Shrek", she gains easy support from audiences just from her look alone. Perfectly matched with Kåre Hedebrant, leads instantly become characters worth caring about, that even the murders that conspire become a necessity.

Set in Scandinavia, film reminds of "30 Days of Night" as it's filmed as if it never sees the sun and is forever winter. Of course, this works well with the illusion of having the main character as someone who would burst into flames if UV rays touches her skin. This, among others are the film's small touches that further cement the mythology on vampires and adds some more, even. Cats provide a darkly hilarious spin as the film reaches 30 minutes before the credits.

"Låt Den Rätte Komma In" is indeed an enjoyable intimate celebration of loneliness and the things that transpire from it. Setting it with a vamp angle further uplifts the thematical significance of the film, although even if they exist, picture doesn't pretend to be more than it actually is. Conceived with a specific audience in mind, the curious would also be rewarded. Film often reaches subliminal moments that will live long in the memory.

Let the Right One In (2008) **** 

The one thing I keep reading about Let the Right One In is how it's such a unique horror movie. Horror movie this, horror movie that. This has left me baffled. How can you have seen the film and taken it as a horror movie? To be sure, it is a supernatural drama with a few moments of thrill and fear, but a horror movie? No, I simply cannot refer to it as such. While I may play semantics with the critics on that issue, I agree wholeheartedly that Let the Right One In is a special film.

This Swedish gem is set during the blistering cold days of winter. A 12 year old boy, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is at the mercy of the school bullies. He shuffles quietly around school, talks softly, his innocence and fears diverting his desires for revenge. He lives in an apartment complex with his mother. One day new neighbors move in. A man puts up cardboard and plastic over the windows, and avoids conversation with other tenants.

One night as Oskar sits outside in the playground, a young girl appears, hardly dressed for winter and pale as the snow itself. They talk briefly, and she tells him that they cannot be friends. Yet she comes back again the next night, and again they talk. Oskar goes off to visit his father, who lives in a rural area. Together they enjoy themselves, and Oskar finally appears happy. When he returns he continues his encounters with the girl.

Her name is Eli (Lina Leandersson). She never appears except during the night time. And for good reason. Although the film only slowly explicitly reveals that she is a vampire, it's implicit from the early sequences. In one early scene, Eli's caretaker meticulously packs his gear, then goes to a nearby park where he meets, then chloroforms, then blood lets a passerby. He's interrupted by a dog and its owners before he can finish the job, and runs off. He finds blood for her, so she must not kill herself, at least as often. His failures continue though, and she must quench her thirst. When her caretaker is discovered, he burns himself with acid to hide his identity and keep her safe. He gives himself to her as his final act, now she is on her own.

Although these moments of violence are quite bloody, and at times graphic, they're simply a necessity of the real story, the relationship between Oskar and Eli. She eventually provides him with friendship, maybe even love, as they agree to "go steady." She implores him to stand up to the bullies, which he does, though it may lead him to more trouble in the end. He learns she is a vampire in time, as he must, but he accepts this and her, and finds it in himself to help her.

Let the Right One In is a very quiet and patient film. It rightly focuses on the progression of friendship between Oskar and Eli first and foremost. At its heart, this is a beautiful and tender contemplation. Despite its dark undertones, the film never feels sinister. It retains its sweetness right down to its graphic climax.

Oskar and Eli are wonderfully drawn characters. Both young actors are emphatically true to their characters, making them all the more sympathetic. The director Thomas Alfredson shoots them in muted tones, from their point of view, instead that of an adult. He makes sparse use of music, allowing the crunching of snow, the grumbling of stomachs, the ambient sounds of the world instead to frame the action on screen. It's a very well made film, from bottom to top.

Let the Right One In is a wonderfully unique picture. The movies were made to tell stories like these. I have not read the book the film is adapted from, but it certainly would expand on much of what is only hinted at here. But what is included in the film needs no expansion. This is such a wonderful film as it stands, in its boldness, its darkness, and its touching beauty.

Let the right one in, critically acclaimed, is a Swedish Indie-like coming of age story with a vampire thread thrown in for good measure. During its runtime, which felt like it was going for a new world record, we see the excruciatingly slow developing relationship between Oscar, a 12 year old bullied schoolboy and Eli, a much older Vampire who very convincingly passes as a 12 year old herself.

Though the premise is original, which at least should entertain a shade of interest, the whole movie is set up to be more of a painting than an actual film. What little plot they undertook to be screened not only got lost in the superabundance of superfluous scenes, it also drowned in an overall feeling of lifelessness. I got the impression that this was intentional although it boggles the mind what they felt was so interesting about the story arc that the movie could get away with the glaring lack of suspense, momentum or indeed, any respect for logic.

This brings me to my main complaint, which is that nothing in the story really made much sense to me. People are hung from trees to capture their blood, brutal killings take place in plain sight in the streets galore, but I didn't get the impression anyone in the movie really cared about it. No police is informed, no investigation is started. Although I can imagine why the storyteller tried to follow a different path, the absurdity of it was so glaring; you'd think there was some hidden point to it. But there isn't. It's just plain weird and annoyingly so. 

Another issue I take with the film is the acting/portrayal of the unsympathetic and uninvolved characters. No one acts according to the laws of human behavior; it's like watching a parody of something I'm not aware even existed. 

Right in the beginning of the movie we see the character Oscar mimicking the stabbing of one of his school chums. He uses a tree for inspiration and mutters the words "scream, scream you pig!". The way he spoke these words raised a couple of eyebrows with me, and the brows didn't seem comfortable to settle back down during the course of the film. I'm sorry, but no one talks or acts like that. The boy either simply can't act or was instructed to behave like an autistic buffoon with an IQ to match his shoe size while saliva continuously drools from his mouth. Most of the other dim characters in the movie fare even worse and I think it's sadistic to expose an intelligent audience to this sort of nonsense.

For a full length future film, this movie simply lacks plot, scenario and a sense of direction. I'm still completely unsure what the filmmakers set out to create here. As a coming of age type of film, nothing really was added to the vast legacy this theme already laid down for us to enjoy in numerous books and films. As a vampire movie, it just lacks everything that makes those movies enjoyable to those that are into that genre; namely suspense and humor(?). And as a slow moving Indie movie it really lacks art. The endless showing of dimly lit streets or droplets from a tap forced down by Newtonian law, while being accompanied by abstruse orchestral overtures, shouldn't be a point in itself. And neither should the deliberate lack of conversation be, nor its replacement: long tedious shots of facial expressions that try really very hard to express nothing at all.

In short, this film is a dud. Like a bomb that doesn't go off, it just lies in the ground after a forgotten war to harmlessly corrode away into oblivion. A seemingly endless string of mind-numbing scenes built on an almost non existing plot line where suspense is replaced by predictability and out of place absurdism.

The cinematic vampires I've seen to date in cinemas recently have usually been the ramped up sexy versions, where it's either black leather on lithe female frames, or dreamy hunks to whom teenage girls would sacrifice their necks to in order to live with their lover boy forever.

While the release of Twilight had made a lot of noise in the commercial theatres last year and raking in an obscene amount of money sending fan-girls into a frenzy, one vampire movie has been making its rounds very successfully in the film festival circuit, and the accolades garnered thus far have been nothing less than stellar. Come next week, you too will know why, as Let The Right One In (LTROI) gets its deserved commercial release here.

LTROI is pared down to the very basics, and that in itself is a refreshing take thanks to John Ajvide Lindqvist's story and Tomas Alfredson's assured direction, both confident that there's absolutely no need for artificial spices to spruce up the film. We have the need for plasma for survival, the human type and not cherry ade from animals and tomatoes. Sunlight kills immediately and fiercely, not to introduce some industrial light and magic moments to glitter with sparkle dust. And their condition forces them to be in isolation, because killing sprees bring unwanted attention, but weakness from dawn to dusk means a caretaker is never far. Find out too what the title means, as I believe it's probably a step boldly taken to define certain consequences.

The emotions of their two leads were relied on heavily to bring the narrative forward in what essentially is a very quiet film until feasting time. Eli (Lina Leandersson) arrives in a small town with her minder Hakan (Per Ragnar), who provides for a number moments filled with dark humour no thanks to the unfortunate situations he finds himself stuck in while preparing meals. Their neighbour is a timid boy Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), who has school playground politics problems because of the constant taunting from schoolmates, thus coasting through his existence imagining himself fighting back for some respect, but afraid to translate his bravado for real with that knife he carries around.

Children are such that, with a certain degree of confidence, putting two-two together, you're likely to see a friendship being struck with little or no prejudice. Coming from lonely backgrounds, both strike an almost immediate friendship, despite Eli being able to come out only at night, and some very obvious hints of her nocturnal prowess. To Oskar, Eli is his first real friend who through love, gives him the courage and encouragement to face up to his demons. It's a tender love story between the two even after Oskar's discovery of the true identity of his best friend. But like best friends, such are secrets between themselves, and nothing in the world is going to change that.

It's kinda terrifying knowing that the Oskar in a way condones the killings that Eli commits, and the direction here to show that is unflinching. Given the atmospherically quiet moments, it magnifies every point when the hunter snacks on its prey, with the patches of warm blood staining the pale white face of a child, thanks also to some nifty make up, and special effects where it mattered. The noisy violence is in stark contrast to its more touching moments, especially if one thinks that Hakan's life is a suggestion to what Oskar's would eventually be if he so decides to follow down the same slippery slope. The toning down of pedophilia, as does Eli's sexual ambiguity, allows for this thought to fester.

I hate to do a comparison here between a truly great genre film and one that aspired to reach its heights, but I guess since many would be familiar with Twilight, allow me to indulge then why LTROI makes Twilight eat sparkle dust. For starters, the latter is your typical Hollywood blockbuster treatment where everything has to be explicitly shown and in verbatim. LTROI leaves it to the greatest tool you possess - your imaginative mind, and that in itself accentuates the level of horror that goes unseen, and giving that all round creepy feeling to it too.

Twilight had a teenage angst romance that was quite childish. LTROI shows how the innocence of love could be miles more mature, with its tender moments here making Bella Swan and Edward Cullen look like adults with bored sex lives. Gone too are (what I deem now as) nonsensical pop and rock tunes peppering the aural track, and the clever use of silence (i.e. knowing when to shut up) served only to highlight genuine tension and impending doom. Yes LTROI is less showy, but miles more effective in its storytelling craft and technique.

For a genuinely satisfying vampire movie, Let The Right One In nails it and deserves being Highly Recommended.

P.S. Hollywood now wants to remake this. Now that's a truly terrifying thought!

A Nutshell Review: Let The  Right One In

Let the Right One In is poignant, sad, weird, different, elusive, as well as being a fine movie. Oskar is a blond 12-year-old who lives with his divorced mother in an apartment complex in Stockholm. He's bullied incessantly at school. Neither his mother nor his father seems to have much time for him. He's a quiet kid who dreams of getting back at his tormentors. He doesn't seem to have any friends. Then an older man and a child move into the apartment building. Her name, we learn, is Eli. She's 12 years old, too, pale, and at times looks haggard. Oskar meets her one evening in the playground in front of the apartment complex. Snow is deep on the ground. The weather is freezing. The cold doesn't bother Eli. By now we know Eli is a vampire. Oscar realizes this later. 

Let The Right One In is a strange fusion of coming-of-age and horror, but the result is something else. Don't ask me what. It doesn't fit in any film genre I'm familiar with. Calling it 'horror" is too facile. Calling it "coming of age" is too shallow. In the course of the movie people will die, drained of their blood. Eli's...what?...protector?...partner?...the older man named Hakan she lives with...will kill for the blood he and Eli must have to survive. He'll die a terrible death himself. Eli will tell Oskar that they can't be friends, yet Oskar yearns for friendship. He asks Eli to be his girl friend before he knows she is a vampire and she asks him if he would like her if she weren't a girl. When he asks her age, she tells him she is 12 and has been for a long time. Oskar's innocence may be part of his protection. Eli is not innocent, but at times she seems as fragile as Oskar. Like the man she lives with, Eli will kill for blood. She must. 

Kare Hedebrant plays Oskar and Lina Leandersson plays Eli. I understand that at the time of filming Hedebrant was 12 and Leandersson was 11. Both were nonprofessionals. They are unnervingly natural. Neither makes a single false step. Hedebrant is exactly what a lonely, bullied 12-year-old could be. Leandersson is able to imply things we may not want to know just be being still. I wound up hoping for the best for both Oskar and Eli...but what the best might be could go in a number of directions. 

This is a film, adapted from his novel by John Ajvide Linqvist, which invites discussion and interpretation. Not everything is kept clear, and, for me, that increases the sense of elusiveness. Lat Den Ratte Komma is a wonderful film.

Didn't expect this movie to be that good but... well... for me it was. "Låt den rätte komma in" has overwhelming cinematography (probably the strongest I've seen this year...), extraordinary acting (not only considering the age of both protagonists it's outstanding) and a wonderfully dark love-story with horror elements. Though it's a vampire story it stays natural. After all it's a very human story about two outsiders that find and accept each other despite all differences.

As far as I can see it doesn't happen often these days, that a film is told in such a fine and sensitive manner like this work by director Tomas Alfredson. There never is too much talking and often what you experience is just an image which tells more than 1000 words and gives the whole movie even more depth. The director did perfect work and his writer and novelist Lindqvist succeeded to do something not many can do: he wrote the original novel AND the screenplay. I think the screenplay has the right focus on his book. Perfect work.

My conclusion: If you love beautifully dark vampire stories, I'd recommend "Låt den rätte komma in". I'm sure this picture has excellent chances to get at least nominated for an Oscar. Let's only hope no one in Hollywood will get the stupid idea to remake this movie.
