### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
At first glance, the film seems to be about how a promising congressman from New York destroyed his political career because of inappropriate postings on the internet. It is to some extent, but it is also about how the media can build up someone in one moment and tear that same person down the next. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.

"Weiner" begins with archival footage of Anthony Weiner as the liberal firebrand on the floor of the House. Having not known much about Rep. Weiner before the scandal, this was eye-opening to me. Here you really see what he could have become had the scandal not occurred.

From that point on, the film follows the subject from the initial scandal up until the aftermath of his New York mayoral run. As expected, the film shows numerous clips about Weiner during this critical time in his career and the media circus that ensued. However, what really makes the film compelling is the behind-the-scenes footage between Weiner, his campaign staff and his family. You really feel like a "fly on the wall" eavesdropping on some very personal discussions. The film was co-directed and shot by Josh Kriegman, who once served as Weiner's chief-of-staff. Kriegman and his co- director Elyse Steinberg, were given unprecedented access. What does go is so personal and intense that at one point in the film, Kriegman even asks Weiner why he is even allowing them to continue shooting.

"Weiner," while infuriating sometimes to watch, is a wild ride of a character-study filled with contradictions. On the one hand, Anthony Weiner seems to be fully aware of the damage he has inflicted to his career and his family, but at other times appears quite delusional. Seeing "Weiner" is like watching a slow moving train wreck. You know what is going to happen, but you watch it anyway to see how it happens. 

This film definitely falls into the category of "truth is stranger than fiction." It's hard to imagine another personality in recent history that is so unfiltered and self-absorbed in his quest for higher office, with the exception of a fellow named, Donald Trump. 

This is not just a film about Anthony Weiner, but a critique at how the mainstream media values style and sensationalism over substance. This is evidenced in a sequence that occurs toward the end of the film that must be seen to be believed. In short, "Weiner" is a fascinating character-study and must be considered an early awards favorite.

As a New Yorker who voted in the mayoral election that is depicted in this film.....ahhh, if I had only known better. 

Weiner is a politician who had a sex/porn/internet problem and it didn't disappear the minute he was publicly disgraced. Yet, he was an excellent politician, without a doubt a better candidate than the one I voted for. And yet, the story that was most in the news at the time (and shown in this film) was his poor judgement about his personal life, and negligible press about his competency as a champion for the middle class. Furthermore, the timeline of the Sydney Leathers relationship was hardly prominent. I hadn't realized it was over a year earlier. (Albeit better if it had been five years earlier though.)

History is replete with great leaders who had amoral sex lives, not the least Harding who had an illegitimate child shortly before his election as our 29th president. We won't even discuss what happened in JFK's life, and yet the public forgives him. 

In no way do I think Weiner should be condoned for acting so inappropriately while being a public servant, but it would also be great if we could focus on POLITICAL competency instead of extramarital sexual blunders. As I see it, when Donald Trump is the GOP nominee with all his sexual improprieties, obviously it's all about the media. And to me, that is the true essence of this documentary. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE MEDIA. 

My takeaway, although cliché, is that it's the media's storyline, which panders to the readers' lowest common interest -- bringing serious consequences to our politics today.

"Weiner" (2016 release; 96 min.) is a documentary about disgraced new York politician Anthony Weiner (pronounced: "wiener", not "whiner"). As the movie opens, we have Weiner in an interview chair, talking to the documentary makers. We then go back to 2011, when we get a thumbnail overview of how a sexting scandal led to his resignation from US Congress. We then shift to "May 13, 2013, two years after his resignation". Weiner is about to enter the race for New York Mayor, and along the way decided to give unlimited access to these documentary makers during his campaign. By then you are already nailed to your seat as you watch what is unfolding.

Couple of comments: this is the first full-length documentary for co-writer and directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. While the comeback attempt in and of itself would've made for riveting viewing, can you imagine how they felt when smack in the middle of the unfolding campaign, another controversy explodes? It doesn't get any better than this for documentaries (on the same level as "The Armstrong Lie" about Lance Armstrong and "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart" about Wilco). There are so many fine moments in this documentary, and I certainly don't want to spoil your viewing experience, but allow me to just point out two scenes: there is a very clever montage of Weiner's campaign taking a foothold and gaining track (to the point of leading the polls), set to the "Theme of S.W.A.T.", and it works beautifully. Even better is the scene between Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin when the second controversy explodes. Ah yes, the wife. Normal people like you and me immediately think: why on earth does she decide to stick by her man, time and again, humiliation upon humiliation? Then it dawns on me: these are not 'normal' people like you and me. Huma stays with Weiner the same reason Hillary stayed with Bill: it's all about the power! These career politicians know one thing, and one thing only: get the power, and stay in power, whatever means necessary, whatever personal sacrifice is needed along the way. When the final curtain comes down (Weiner obviously did not win the mayoral election), one of the directors asks Weiner "why did you let me film all this?". You'll just have to see for yourself how Weiner responds to this... Bottom line: if you like documentaries, you will absolutely love this riveting look at a disgraced politician whose narcissistic personality disorder is fully exposed here.

"Weiner" made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and I couldn't wait to see it. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, to my surprise. Maybe strong word-of-mouth (which this movie surely generates) will lead to wider exposure down the road through VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. Meanwhile, "Weiner" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

It's so easy to judge Anthony Weiner from reading text on social media, in the newspaper, and / or the news shows on TV. "Weiner" is a great documentary film and as others have written, riveting. I was fixated the entire 90 minutes; all the time asking myself, "Why would he let them document this?", all the while cringing for his wife, Huma Abedin.

Where is the line drawn between loyalty and abuse? Although Huma is very clear on where she will and won't participate in the documentary, you wonder where and when does her loyalty to her husband become nothing more than emotional abuse? There are two types of obscene behavior, the indecent kind that brought Anthony Weiner down, and the disgusting kind that has little disregard for the rights of others. The documentary exposes the latter in a defining rarity: With only 4 - 5 % of the vote and dead last, the media chases Weiner all around like dogs in heat trying to squeeze every last tidbit out of the story.

Who are we to judge? When we become persistent observers of misery or scandal...fascinated with the distressing sordid scandalous events of others, are we engaging in voyeurism? If you see the movie, please let me hear back from you.

Greetings again from the darkness. Normally I would have no interest in a movie with this title, but in this case, it's a chance to get a glimpse into the psychological make-up of a guy who obliterated his own political career  by simply being unable to keep his privates private. The end result of the efforts from filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg is nearly unrestricted access to a NYC mayor candidate's campaign, as well as a look at a politician that is at times tense, and other times funny (in a laughing AT you kind of way).

In 2011, seven-term New York Congressman Anthony Weiner resigned in the aftermath of a sexting scandal made worse by (what else?)  his lying and attempted cover-up. The film begins with a clip of one of Weiner's explosive speeches, meant to portray his expertise as a legislator and politician. This is quickly followed by the pun-filled headlines that exposed his sexting habit, seemingly leaving his political career in the dust.

Picking up two years later, the film finds the disgraced former Congressman running a campaign for NYC mayor. We can't be too surprised as we have learned numerous times that many politicians are addicted to power and life in the public eye. What makes this an interesting subject is two-fold: how publicly humiliated Weiner had been, and the fact that his wife is Huma Abedin, long-time Hillary Clinton adviser and aide.

We don't learn how it happened, but we do find Anthony and Huma are still married, are parents to a young child (she was pregnant when the first scandal hit), and that Huma fully supports his mayoral candidacy. As the campaign kicks off, Weiner is a frontrunner, proving that we are a forgiving lot. The cameras capture him in full candidate mode  making calls to potential donors, giving speeches, dealing with staffers, and working the crowds at his energy-filled parades. Of course, it's all a façade  or at least half of one.

When the second sexting scandal hits and "Carlos Danger" makes headlines as Weiner's online pseudonym, the real trainwreck begins, and we find it impossible to turn away. It's at this point where our feelings are confirmed  Huma is by far the more interesting of these two personality polar opposites. Where Weiner is two-faced  bouncing between humbled and overly ambitious; Huma is cool, collected and (seemingly) smart.

Weiner remains clueless about his chances, and the level of tension skyrockets in meetings and during spousal moments. It's impossible not to believe that the energies used towards the campaign would have been better spent in therapy  both individual and as a couple. His stream of lies proved he had not changed his ways, and his periodic reflective and apologetic moments are diminished by his true color nastiness, which is more pervasive.

The film gets unnecessarily sidetracked during a segment that features one of Weiner's phone sex relationships  codenamed "Pineapple". Entirely too much time is spent on her pathetic publicity grab, and fortunately it all falls flat. It is a reminder that the media never misses a chance to film a frenzy  even if they have to manipulate it. There is no room in a documentary for TWO trainwrecks! After the film and the irresistible draw of watching this ego-driven dude never once come to grips with why he is socially unacceptable as a leader, we realize there are unanswered questions. Why did Huma stick with her husband? Why was she onboard with him getting back in the game  did she really miss the public eye? The filmmaker flat out asks Weiner "Why have you let me film this?" Perhaps the answer to that last question is somewhat explained when you know that Anthony Weiner made an appearance in "Sharknado 3". Some people just need the spotlight.

The hecklers, the eye rolls, the angry outbursts all lead up to Lawrence O'Donnell asking Weiner "What's wrong with you?" I asked myself that same question after the movie when I realized that I was mesmerized the entire time. As for Huma ever allowing herself to be the subject of a documentary, we can only assume that she is too sagacious to allow such unfettered camera access to her work. I suppose her appearance in the next "Sharknado" is equally unlikely.

Some time ago I watched the terrific French film "Ridicule." The French aristocracy's main form of entertainment was to fool someone in the "lower class" into joining their parties and, at first, let them think that they have been invited to the parties because of their wit and charm -- only to be humiliated, mocked, and scorned. Ridiculing someone was their ultimate pleasure. There have always been bullies.

This movie was well done, but I have no idea why Weiner would subject himself and his wife to this terrible humiliation. I blame him for wanting to do this. Maybe he thought it would help restore his political career. I fault myself for watching his fall from grace because I knew about his story already. It was morbid curiosity and I felt ashamed of myself. We Americans seem obsessed with famous people's personal lives.

Humiliation is a terrible experience. His name will be associated with his indiscretions for a long time. His wife and son are collateral damage. I feel sorry for that family and hope they heal. This feels like his last chance and he needs to get psychiatric help with his seeming need to destroy himself. Anthony is not a bad man. He made his political career the center of who he was. He liked the fame. The fall was long and steep.

Everybody knows that politics and political figures are so common with scandal, corruption, and bribes, and you guessed it sex scandals! And the world again was rocked with one Anthony Weiner! This eye opening and interesting film called "Weiner" looks at how the media and scandal of texts and photos and nude pictures help bring down a former congressman and mayoral candidate. The news footage is nearly from every network and the interviews are a compelling saga and the way the camera follows around Anthony and wife Huma is so interesting as you the viewer can feel the tension and pain between the two as the scandals break, and the speak and words from the mouth of Weiner confirm that he is a destroyed and beaten man. Most of you who follow the news know the story in 2010 a hacker and media outlet had broke news that Anthony Weiner had texted and snapped pictures of his erect and hard penis thru his underwear and the incident would cause him to resign from congress and then later in 2013 when he got back in the game or his "New York Grove" the next scandal hit online on a website from a source a young girl named Sydney Leathers who's an attractive big breasted girl that exchanged text nude pictures and even admitted to phone sex with Anthony. And you guessed it this would destroy his mayoral campaign and political life, yet thru it all Huma would stand by her man. Overall near excellent film that shows how a vice when revealed and exposed can destroy your profession and bring you down in life never being the same as some like Anthony Weiner never learn as the habit is so hard to break!

New York Congressman Anthony Weiner gets caught in a sexting scandal and resigns in June 2011. He decides to reenter politics by running for Mayor of New York. His campaign in the Democratic primary in 2013 starts to pick up speed when a second sexting scandal erupts. His wife Huma Abedin again comes to his side but the campaign flounders. Weiner is no doubt a compelling Shakespearian tragic figure. Once his scandal erupts again, this gets very uncomfortable at times. The central star becomes the mysterious Huma. In some respects, she's the Spinx holding back her secrets. In other respects, her looks could kill and she speaks volumes with her silence.

"The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of." Blaise Pascal 

"Man, you're all full of **** anyway." Passerby on street

"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuh Heheheheheheh Weiner..." Beavis & Butt-head (probably)

I feel like these three quotes kind of sum up a lot of what this movie, Weiner, a documentary that chronicles as a harrowing, cringe-inducing tragedy of politician Anthony Weiner's failed bid for the 2013 Mayoral race in New York city, is going for, but only part of it. You can look at what the filmmakers present from different angles - as a portrait of a media that, due to how it operates (especially in New York city with the Daily News and Post and everything under the sun) in reporting the 'news' of this or that or the other with Weiner's sexting as "Carlos Danger", and how this media obsession perpetuates things further and further (technology itself is part of it - imagine what would've happened if things were only 10 or 15 years before this), or of course as a portrait of a man and his marriage which we see glimpses of in quiet looks and stares and things that the (mostly) fly-on-the-wall filmmakers get.

What you think about Weiner ahead of time may influence you going in. Or if you don't know much about him outside of the Daily Show and Colbert Report skits it may be educational in that way of recent/contemporary history. I think that the movie is fair in that it shows ALL the coverage - both the bytes in the various cable news coverage and things like Weiner's appearance on Lawrence O'Donnell where he was asked point blank "What's *wrong* with you?" - while showing Weiner in both the (semi good) early run-up when he started his campaign and, indeed, had a lead to start with, and then as he kept his composure much as he could while the second scandal blew up and wouldn't go away.

Could it have gone away? No, probably (or definitely) not, and the question of should or shouldn't he have dropped out of the race comes to mind. But the coverage of it all in this film is uncanny. At times you'll wonder how they got a camera in such a place, or how, up until the moment the filmmakers are told to get out of a room, they stay there until told to leave (or on the flip-side the very funny moment when in a car the director happens to ask a particular touchy question and Weiner can't help but go off on the guy, like "Is THIS what you mean by 'fly on the wall?') A lot of the humor that does come up is in that pitch-black, uncomfortable way that goes far beyond anything you'd ever see on Louie or Curb Your Enthusiasm. And the cringing isn't always funny - sometimes it comes down to the look two people have with nothing being said out loud and everything being said in the eyes.

One of the things that is hard to not come away with, whether by the end you feel some modicum of sympathy (or, hell, even empathy if that's possible) with Weiner from this period of time, is that he's not your average politician or, I should say, one that is the usual type we might think of as a politician. Usually they come off as stiff, bought and paid for or at the least handled to such a degree as to seem inhuman, or try to come off as "wholesome" and yet say the most monstrous things.

Weiner was/is a liberal, but you get someone who can talk in reasoned tones except when, well, things p*** him off (his entree into the spotlight came in his time as Congressman when he exclaimed "I will NOT yield" during a debate on a 9/11 responders bill), or when he is confronted by someone. We see him not back down from people, whether it's hard questions at a City Island campaign stop or a heckler in a deli. The guy is tough, and yet there's also a self-deprecating humor at times. And he'll even watch things like the O'Donnell clip - extended version online, of course - just to get motivated to start his day. What a pair of... oh, nevermind.

And yet at the same time what I love about the movie is that it shows that he can't escape, and really liked to be a part of, the whole 'game' of it, the act. When he does an ad for TV it feels like he's acting for the camera, and seeing the footage from this ad in its finished form intercut with his wife sitting by the side looking a mixture of bored and (maybe) frustrated is astonishing. It's difficult not to leave the movie with some judgment of him, and at the same time the trick of this is that it presents him in (as much as possible) the full, er, 'package' (sorry, puns are unavoidable, I tried). The point is if you like to see the nitty gritty political maneuvering and how a mind works in the midst of a scandal, this is a serious delight (both serious and delightful).

PS: Recently Weiner's retracted how he feels in the documentary and wishes he hadn't made the movie and won't watch it. The latter is fair, while the former is... well, who knows.

Many politicians have been caught up in scandals, but few have been quite as comical as Anthony Weiner's scandal. He would have been mocked a lot less if he had just cheated with his secretary like other politicians.

While that level of embarrassment would have made me hide in a bunker, Weiner got back on the political horse. As a New Yorker, I was shocked when he entered the mayoral race, and stunned when it looked like he might actually win the nomination. 

This documentary follows Weiner's surprising resurgence and less surprising second crash. It's a fascinating movie. Weiner is a natural politician who knows how to work a crowd, but he's also a sex addict who, for all his apologies, seemed never able to accept that he had a problem needing addressing. His wife Huma seems lovely, and much of the movie consists of her looking as though she really, really wants to punch Weiner in the face. We watch the campaign staff as they discover they have signed up for a train wreck. We see Sydney Leathers trying to come across as the aggrieved party while simultaneously using the publicity to start a porn career.

Weiner is an interesting guy, and I think New Yorkers rejected for him less for his sexual compulsion than for his lying about it. In a way it seems as though his denial is a tragic flaw that made Weiner his own worst enemy. It's sad, and my heart breaks for Huma. But let's be honest, it's still one of the most amusing scandals we've had.

I'm not going to give a blow by blow precis of everything the documentary deals with as some other reviewers have done. You can watch it for yourself to find out the details. If you're asking me should you watch this film, I have to say yes, it's worth your time.

What I wanted to say, having seen this film, is that it reveals fully just what New York and America has lost in losing Mr Weiner from the political arena. He is (or was) a brilliant politician who seems to genuinely care for the wellbeing of his constituents and wanted to enact change to improve the lives of everyone. That he was unable to control his impulses is a real tragedy because, as we have seen, he's destroyed his career, his marriage and his credibility and presumably is now unelectable in any political office (though my position on that may change!).

This film helps us understand Huma's decision to stand by him after the first revelations and even the second and I fully understand and respect her decision to leave after it all happened again in the summer of 2016.

Even if you don't have a particular interest in politics, or sexting or Weiner, this film is worth watching for the human dramas that unfold during filming, especially as his staff discover and deal with the new scandal that arises mere weeks before the Mayoral election.

"I did a lot of things. But I did a lot of other things, too." Anthony Weiner

The tragicomic story of seven-term congressman from New York, Anthony Weiner, is almost too absurd to be true. After resigning from Congress over sexting, while waging a vigorous 2013 campaign for mayor of NYC, Weiner is disclosed to have texted again visions of his maleness to other women than his wife, Huma Abedin. The tragedy is that this aide to then Senator Hillary Clinton is an accomplished woman, totally undeserving the abject humiliation her husband's sexting has caused her.

Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg in this fascinating doc called Weiner gained permission from him to film his most intimate moments of the campaign, especially with his wife while his tech-straying disgrace is made public. While for us commoners, such peccadilloes amount to little in a public forum (but much, of course, in the personal arena), these moments are heart-rending to see: This accomplished wife forces herself, with barely a smile, to support her husband.

The ancient Greeks knew well the flaws and foibles of celebrities gone wild. In this revelation of hubris, an overweening pride that comes before the fall, even the tragedians might not have dared to show the Congressman sexting even after his initial exposure (so to speak). Yes, he sends photos of his masculinity to a 22 year old woman, who will complete his ignominy by revealing them to a press overjoyed at a second round.

The despair is that he had seemingly come back into the good graces of the public, only to be outed again and lose that support and the mayoral primary to Bill DeBlasio. The documentary is there for the grand moments of revelation and shame, none more poignant than privately with his wife, who seems almost shell-shocked by the new revelation. 

Unfortunately, the quotes at the beginning of this review are the most insight we ever get, despite the filmmakers' intimacy, to help us understand why such a gifted populist should so carelessly toss away his position and reputation. Perhaps his wife's mute incredulity stands for our own.

In the end we must conclude with a saying never more appropriate than here: "Who knows the secrets of the human heart?"

While watching Weiner (2016) it is easy to forget that this is a reality-based documentary not a fictional sit-com or tragi-drama. The film presents two possibilities: we either expect too much of politicians or the subject of this movie is a uniquely disturbed aberration of the political class. Either way, this compelling and well-produced documentary is essential viewing for anyone interested in professional politics and the impact it has on those who seek power.

Using 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary style and archival footage, the film tells the story of Anthony Weiner whose name is now laughed at around the world. As a Democrat Congressman from 1999 to 2011 he gained national attention for his vocal advocacy for working-class Americans. His career was shortened when he texted sexually suggestive images of himself that, in conservative America, was enough finish him in politics forever. But Weiner's charisma and boundless energy saw him re- emerge in 2013 to campaign for Mayor of New York under a banner of mea culpa for past errors. He was well ahead in the polls and just as his redemption appeared secure there were further revelations that showed he was still a serial 'sexting' offender. His popularity immediately plummeted. The film documents the impact on his wife and campaign staff and the sense of betrayal by a public that had been warming to his revival but had now lost all faith. He was stuck with a reputation as a pathological liar, a sexual transgressor and an unfaithful husband. While the film is mainly focused on Weiner, the silent heroine of the film is his extraordinarily talented wife Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Hillary Clinton. The words "spousal abuse" are heard in this film but left unexplored.

Why is it so fascinating to watch a psychological train-wreck in slow motion? Weiner represents a modern-day conundrum of public life. His transgressions are far less than those of former President Bill Clinton or many others and whatever he did wrong it involved him and his cell phone only. Being a noisy Jewish Democrat who fought tooth and nail for national health insurance made him an easy target for conservative media and the early success of his comeback campaign threatened many interests. Audiences will judge Weiner based on their own politics and sense of morality, but history is unlikely to be kind. This is a fascinating documentary that offers a unique glimpse into a dynamic but fatally flawed narcissist who is either a profoundly dishonest person or we, the people, need to be more forgiving about human weakness.

It's funny. Damn funny. Just saying the word 'Weiner' makes me laugh. I know, I'm ten years old, but I laugh every time. I'm not the only one though, as you can listen to forty seconds of a radio show below to see well-respected and professional film critics laugh at the word. It might be ironic and even funnier when you say the word and imply the former politician Anthony Weiner from a few years ago, given what happened with that guy's political run and life. Luckily for us, a couple people made a documentary on Anthony Weiner's life in the thick of all the scandals, simply titled 'Weiner'.

Filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg were granted heavy access in Weiner's home and political campaign offices as Weiner himself was given a second chance in New York City to run for Mayor. If we back up a bit, and as this documentary shows in the first couple of minutes, is that Anthony Weiner was once the top of the democratic field with his amazing and boastful performance at the House of Representatives that made the news for quite a while. You couldn't talk about politics or social issues without bringing up Anthony Weiner and his courageous stand against the opposing view. It wasn't very long before Weiner became a joke, when an image of his weiner showed up in a sexual text message to someone other than his wife Huma Abedin, who was a former adviser for Hillary Clinton.

Anthony lies to the people and media about it all, but then confessed. He resigned from his political office and tried to work on his marriage. This is where this 'Weiner' documentary picks up, with Anthony asking the people for a second chance and his run for mayor. We get glimpses of his home life, campaign rallies, and him riding a bike in New York. Things look on the up and up, but a new scandal hits again with new images taken recently of Weiner's weiner, this time fully exposed to a woman named Sydney Leathers.

In the heart of him running for mayor, all of these images leak and his family and media jump all over it, and not necessarily in a good way. Anthony tries to talk politics on numerous television shows and interviews, but the only thing anyone wants to talk about is his weiner. It's funny and sad all at the same time, and this intimate documentary shows the awkward and sad moments that Huma had to endure at her husband's now public weiner. Anthony seems like a nice enough guy and he seemed to be on top of his game, but he just couldn't seem to keep it in his pants, at least on a text message.

The real villain here is Sydney Leathers, who made everything public just to be famous and get money. She even tried to to show up to his campaign office on election night to make it awkward. That's poor form, but hey, she went on to do adult films. I don't know if Anthony Weiner can ever recover from this second scandal, but I hope the people of the USA can look past personal lives and focus on the political issues he stood for, because that's what it's all about, and not some naked photos online. The documentary does a good fly-on-the-wall type of approach and never gets in the way of any political issues here. It's just about the Weiner family's life in and out of a particularly embarrassing scandal.

RECOMMENDED!

'WEINER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

The critically acclaimed documentary about Anthony Weiner's troubled political campaign for Mayor of New York City, in 2013. The movie was directed by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. It not only received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it was also nominated for dozens of prestigious awards (and it made multiple critics' year end top 10 lists). I think it deserves all of the acclaim it's been given.

The film begins in 2011, when Anthony Weiner was forced to resign from Congress; due to inappropriate photos of him in his underwear surfacing online (that he had previously sent to multiple women). The film then covers his reemergence in politics, in 2013, when he ran for Mayor of New York City (in the Democratic Party primary). The filmmakers follow him, and his wife Huma Abedin, as things first went really well for them (in the campaign). Then the couple was forced to deal with more accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct (by Weiner). This also (of course) caused severe trouble for the campaign.

The movie is cringeworthy to watch, a lot of the time, but (for me at least) I couldn't look away either. It's so bizarrely fascinating, and extremely insightful. The filmmakers managed to get an incredibly intimate look into the personal life of Anthony Weiner; and he claims that they didn't have permission to use video of his wife. The film wouldn't have been nearly as insightful, or intimate, if they hadn't used it though. It's a documentary masterpiece, just about as good as they get (in my opinion)!

Even knowing how this documentary was going to end before watching it, it was fascinating watching the disintegration of a public figure along with his high profile marriage. Simply said, this film shows how Anthony Weiner couldn't resist his voyeuristic urges...not for the sake of his career, or to save his relationship with his wife Huma, or even to maintain a daily presence in the life of his young son. Social media, specifically Twitter, became his undoing ~ along with tweeting directly with porn actress Sydney Leathers, who monopolized exposing (no pun intended) her tweets with Weiner for monetary gain.

If you didn't like Anthony Weiner before watching this documentary, it will only serve to validate your disdain. However, if you had some empathy for the Congressman, hoping this film would explain WHY he chose to do what he did ~ that he might offer some kind of explanation or rationalization for his actions, that was never addressed. It was obvious near the conclusion of filming that he was just DONE with the entire project...and probably regretted approving the documentary in the first place. IMHO, he anticipated winning the New York mayoral election and this film would have served as a taped 'victory lap'...but instead it just served to show his entire life imploding on camera.

"Weiner" is a thoroughly engrossing and at times gut-wrenching documentary. It defines the "fly on the wall" style of documentary film-making, finding a situation in which so many would kill to "be a fly on the wall", and against the odds, making such a proposition possible. 

There is even a time when the filmmaker, off screen, asks Anthony Weiner why he allowed the moment that has just transpired to be filmed. Weiner doesn't seem to know. 

The man is a fantastic politician, one who lit a fire in the hearts of many liberals across the US. But as his political career ascends, his personal life falls apart. "Weiner" begins as the former congressman from Brooklyn rises from the ashes and attempts to run for mayor. As we know, but the filmmakers couldn't have foreseen, another scandal was brewing.

If "Weiner" has a flaw, it's that its subject is too adept at handling questions about his infractions. As such, we don't really get a sense of why he did what he did. This man's enigma is a double-edged sword: he doesn't know why he sent those texts, and he doesn't know why he let a documentary crew follow him around in the midst of the fall out. As a result of this we get closer than we expect, but not too close.

This documentary was awesome. Now I even hate mainstream media more then I did before. For that I thank you.

What I find weird about it is that its actually media that is the perverted one, not Weiner. They just cant stop talking about his dick. To make such a big deal out of a picture is beyond me. Why would that even interest people? And why didn't Weiner take a step back to get some perspective on things. After that leak from a girl who clearly only wants attention, he should have been like "Its a dickpic guys, get over it. Now to the real problems at hand". He gave in to it.

Id vote for Weiner any day of the week. What a strong person he is.

I thought this was a very well-done documentary and it's very timely now with our recent election. Anthony Weiner's entire career derailed because he sent explicit photos (to consenting women, I might add). Kind of ironic given the things that our current president has said on record and been accused of doing.

When all of this originally occurred, it was such a huge blow-up and I didn't watch a lot about it, but I was under the impression that he did all of it while misusing political time or dollars or something since resigned. No, he did it on his private time. That might make him a bad husband or it might make him not very smart when it comes to social media, but it doesn't change his political views or platforms.

So that's what interesting about watching this train wreck. It's the fall from grace of a man who didn't do anything worse than the bad behavior or past and current presidents (e.g. Bill Clinton, Donald Trump). His private life and poor reasoning destroyed his public persona. It's fascinating to get inside his attempt to rise in politics again, seeing the campaign strategy, his remorse (or lack of), and his wife's position on it. Fascinating, but kind of sad.

For those who are familiar with the political campaign and the main subject of the film, nothing that is a huge revelation is discovered. What the documentary definitely does a great job of is simply letting us having a first-person access to the behind-the-scenes footage and events that went on in this trainwreck of a political campaign and arc. Weiner is a very interesting political figure as well as a very entertaining person, and so the documentary doesn't have to do a whole lot to become a fascinating watch about politics and the media. I definitely recommend this to any documentary lover and to anyone really interested in the effects of the media.

Wow. Trump types seem to come in a variety of sizes, forms and assorted dick pic's. This documentary was a close study of a narcissistic, self centered out of touch political candidate that will stop at absolutely nothing to get what he wants to achieve, being elected to a high ranking public office. The mayor of New York in this particular case. 

Anthony Weiner here willingly tries to deceive his presumptive voters, his campaign staff and most importantly his stellar wife by dodging questions, withholding truths and using anyone and everyone close to him as his own private puppets or pawns in an effort to gain voters support. 

In every interview seen here where he is confronted by honest and just questions by both the public and media, Mr Weiner makes it out (in his own mind it seems) that he himself has come away as the victor and smarter one of the exchange when the truth, to us seeing it, is the exact opposite. Scary stuff for sure...

Anthony Weiner is not a household name in the UK, but in the US he is quite notorious. He was a member of the Democrats who was a Congressman for part of New York from 1999 to 2011. He was very outspoken, very brash and seemed to have a lot of popular support. He was married to Huma Abedin  a well known talent in her own right  often seen as the right hand 'man' for Hilary Clinton. So a man with clear abilities and a sort of 'bloody' charisma.

Then in 2011 he got embroiled in a sexting scandal which led to him having to quit congress amid a flurry of media interest. Then in 2013 he decided to stand as a mayoral candidate for New York. Him and his wife gave film makers full access to then during the campaign period and the film premiered at The Sundance Film Festival. The events that unfolded during that campaign are all documented here including some seemingly honest pieces from Weiner.

As far as documentaries go this is a good one to watch as it is both well done and very entertaining  but I think that is because the story is so engaging and he is the sort of man that you kinda want to root for  and then again. Anyway for US viewers they will likely have some knowledge of what transpired  but for the rest of us there is an interesting story here waiting to be viewed.

this is a documentary of not one but two lives unfolding and then imploding on screen. it takes you from the wake of the first scandal of sexting through his attempts of redeeming himself to the ultimate failing after the second incident.

the mostly silent partner in this movie, huma, is hard to watch. you can see that she is not exactly thrilled with the filming but is doing this to support her husband. then, silently, you see her resolve crumble and the incredible sadness that she feels being witness to her husband's demise.

perhaps the worst 'villian' in this film is Sydney leathers, the woman who was not only more than eager to interview regarding her liaisons with weiner but actually gloats about it...on the set of where she is filming a sex film.

the entire documentary is a study of human behavior under pressure from not only political points of view and the media but from social expectations of what we expect of our political leaders, which is to say, perfection in all parts of their lives.

So the well produced documentary is about this political figure of New York of whom I had never heard about (as Finn), whose last name happens to be W(e)iner. Before actually watching the program I had glimpsed a word "narcissist" - perhaps a user written review or from somewhere else. So, I expected to see a documentary about some hardcore political figure who controls people and himself like a marionette's puppeteer does for his subjects.

Well, it's not about such a character. The guy we get to see is actually fantastic individual, with this sexual complex (and it's not like the rest of us don't have them), which gives him hard time (pun intended) in the world of politics.

If only we had such great figures in our political system - who both know the issue at hand and can present them entertainingly and witty. It might even get the majority to take some interest in what is being done and what is not being done in the parliament.

This documentary raised for me the question that is the American media like a child, who gets excited about anything that is famous - only for the sake of it?

Much is already known of Anthony Weiner's sexting scandals, so you might think (a) you already know this story, and (b) you've heard more than enough about this guy (and other recent political candidates' infidelities). To that I would say, you will be blown away by the level of access Weiner provided to filmmakers Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg, and this is a very unique, frankly extraordinary documentary. 

You'll see Weiner trying to rebuild his career by running for mayor, what I have to believe was the original impetus for the film, with obviously the hope for a different outcome. You'll see him behind the scenes with aides and his wife, real-time, as subsequent revelations are made, and the ensuing incredibly difficult conversations. You'll see him fighting with the media and then reacting privately afterwards. You'll see him trying to figure out strategy and messaging in an unguarded way. You'll see him confront hecklers in New York, sometimes well, and sometimes not so well. You'll see the 22-year-old woman he had sexted (who he never met in person) come forward to stalk him on election night, chasing him on the way to make his concession speech, as his aides scurry him through a back route in a nearby McDonald's. It's all jaw-dropping.

You do see the side of Weiner that got him elected 7 times to Congress  his fiery oration, his passion for the issues, his connection to the people in the streets of New York  things that actually made me think more highly of the man. You also see his incredibly poor judgment, his humiliation of his wife Huma Abedin, and his lack of real understanding of what he'd done to her  while he says publicly and privately he's sorry for what he put her through, he gets testy when she won't meet the press and "act like a normal candidate's wife", or participate in a commercial, snarkily commenting "leave  after I do so people don't think we're married or anything", or words to that effect. Meanwhile, her facial reactions tell it all as the documentary progresses, and, ultimately, after the documentary ended, we know his behavior continued. 

As with all great documentaries, this one is honest, impartial, and well-edited to keep the story moving along. What sets it apart is the incredible inside look it gives into the crash and burn of a politician.
