### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This film deserved so much more than what it got, both critically and commercially, when it debuted back in May, where unfortunately it ended up becoming one of the year's biggest box-office bombs. From the mind of one of today's greatest directors, Brad Bird, the same great filmmaker that gave us some of the best animated films of all-time like 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' and the best 'Mission Impossible' film to date in 'Ghost Protocol', 'Tomorrowland' is an inspiring original story that above all promotes the two things that have been lacking in today's cynical society; hope and the promise of a bright future.

Some have accused this film of being preachy for promoting these exact morals. But if you ask me, that just makes this film even stronger as a result in how it boldly goes against the cynical mindset that you see a lot of nowadays in favor of an optimistic vision of a better tomorrow.

Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof make the right decision to not over-rely too much on the world of Tomorrowland. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build-up leading into the film's finale is second to none. Ultimately though it was the finale of the film that made it such a polarizing flick amongst critics. But contrary to popular opinion, I thought it was suitable for what the story demanded. 

In a year where characters like Furiosa are being regarded as some of the greatest film characters of their time, this film features two of the best female leads of the year, played perfectly by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, respectively. As lead Casey, Robertson perfectly conveys the character's optimistic outlook without coming off as annoying while Cassidy shines in the role of the totally bad-ass robot Athena. George Clooney is also excellent in the role of an inventor named Frank who, compared to Casey, is much more pessimistic about the future but gradually regains his faith over the course of the film. 

Don't let this film become one of those forgotten box-office bombs just because it dared to critique the cynicism of today's society. With brilliant performances and visuals and messages that resonate more than ever nowadays, 'Tomorrowland' is easily the most underrated film of 2015 and another masterpiece from director Brad Bird.

I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons. 

The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace.

Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance. 

Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.

As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of the best movies of 2015, and now on my "favourite movie" list.

I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now. Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter? Artistic licence anyone? Right my review is over but I have to keep writing because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count.

I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response, and I must say I had a blast.

The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing.

It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable. Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor. Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well.

The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying something.

I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi genre.

The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little more of the "Tomorrowland" place and that the story needed a little more work.

Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts "The Haunted Mansion" (2003) to shame.

In the end, "Tomorowland" may not fully realize it's potential, but it should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.

This movie is misunderstood, I'm writing my first review with the hope to increase understanding and appreciation of it. Lose your expectations and watch it as it is, an adventure. Think about the things you see, analyze them. Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat all the time from exciting action, it takes a back seat after the beginning.. which the trailer seems to mostly contain and make a false picture of the film. My opinion.. I try and keep this spoiler free.

While perhaps expecting a little more awe scenes, action and insight into the "tomorrowland" society the movie has some very nice scenes. 2/3 into the film it somehow got a bit boring.. but it gets better. Could perhaps have been cut on a place or too, but the scenes were visually pleasing instead. A few confusing aspects here and there like the transition at the end, but who cares? No one has seemed to bother analyzing the philosophical aspects of pre-determination, alternate realities and concepts like our consciousness creating our reality as an reflection of our collective state of mind. The message is a fine one and something to think about our outlook on life.

Does all the negativity really serve us? What's the content of news? Only negative stories. Do they encourage you to go out and make a difference or make you depressed and go on with business as usual it is all going to h*ll anyways? But it sells and is a money making mechanism.. It is a bit humorous the extent the level of fear the society in the movie are in and project unto the children and society, connections to our western society can be made too.

If you notice these things you will appreciate the hints at secret societies and connections to the "Club 33" in Disneyland too and other goodies like the rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison. Nothing too profound or divulging from my understanding but it's there too, Tesla is an under appreciated figure in our history who deserves a lot more recognition.

These are the things I brought with me from this movie, and I'm a sucker for scifi, which was what initially attracted me to the film, but it turned out to just be eye candy to boot :) not the main thing about the film.

I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem of the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are looking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing direction that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and re-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)

I looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers. The stunning visual of Britt Roberts transported to an other worldly place, then George Clooney asking "do you want to go?". Seriously? Heck yea! Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not disappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure, mystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh out loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope. Saw it twice, second time with grand kids. I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney collection.

A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be. Brad Bird doesn't disappoint.

I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining.

I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.

Don't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because this movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie before Inside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The characters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character development to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST PREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because someone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a girl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the twist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the device, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US. Because we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of the end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie exists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of the continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking of, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a great story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the effects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for the first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I saw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie! And the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this movie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7. I was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer didn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick. You have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well, and made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit! Tomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.

From Walt Disney Pictures and Brad Bird, the Oscar winning director of animated classics as The Iron Giant (1999), The Incredibles (2004), and Ratatouille (2007), comes Tomorrowland, a new sic-fi action flick with a powerful message, great acting from George Clooney, Raffey Cassidy, and Britt Robertson, and breathtaking visuals. I give this film a 9.8/10 instead of the mixed reviews from the critics (like a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes). It is also too bad that the movie was a box office flop only earning $210 million worldwide against its HUGE $190 million budget. It is a film about how fun the future can be if everyone has the thought of "a great big beautiful tomorrow". I highly recommend this to any Disney fans or those looking for a fun action flick, then go check this one out.

The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible. 

The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular. I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows! All I know is that I don't agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion.

After watching Tomorrowland last night I have to say it is interesting and insane from Disney to create a movie like this.

Like others I have seen the trailer for the movie. It was my nieces who asked me to watch it with them so I thought why not.

The movie is not your normal Disney motion picture and I'm actually surprised that it got a PG rating. But more or less the film shall make you go WOW.

The film has a original plot that you don't see too often also the visual effects are just breath taken they really brought their top talents to give us effects that will leave you in amazed. 

The Cast:George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Hugh Laurie made the film work with their performances George and Britt actually did a strong job in the film. 

There is also some good action that make you go that's insane. It actually surprised that they did this in a Disney movie

However the film did stall a few times and part of the story didn't make any sense leaving you feel disappointed. 

Overall Tomorrowland took something different and ran with it so you might be surprised once you watch it.

I give Tomorrowland an 8 out of 10

So, before I get to the movie, a word about some of the negative reviews here. Wow, there are so many! I'm not sure if they saw the same movie as I did, or if they are all just devoid of a sense of wonder and fun, but there are an awful lot of people that really disliked this movie. Of course, when you read their "arguments" (I'll be generous and call them that), you realize that most of their discontent stems from the fact that they thought the movie was going to be something else entirely.

I'm one of the most cynical and jaded moviegoers going and I'm always ready to rip a new celluloid butthole in any film that deserves it, but this film does not warrant some of the comments here. When I see people complaining this movie is too violent, or that it isn't a family movie, or any of the number of bemusing complaints, I wonder if they aren't exactly the kind of people that this movie warns its viewers about. Namely, those so obsessed with negativity, that they can't accept anything that is fun.

This movie surprised me, because I had heard bad things about it and it was, in part, penned by Damon Lindelof, whose work it is fair to say I find by turns amusing (not in a good way) and irritating. I'm not sure how much of the story is down to him, but regardless, this counts as one of his better efforts in my book.

So what will you get when you sit down to watch this movie? You'll get two hours or so of utterly harmless fun, aimed primarily at kids, but with enough more adult themes in it to entertain the adults among us. That said, it isn't at all offensive, or violent, and it isn't boring. It moves along at a decent pace. There are slower moments in it, but the action scenes move along briskly when they appear, and they appear quite often. Any violence on display at all is aimed squarely at robots.

There is only one scene where I exclaimed out loud in surprise, because I wasn't expecting it at all, and that was when the little girl robot gets hit by a pickup truck out of nowhere. It's a bit of a shock, to be honest, but she is quickly shown to be unharmed by the incident. However, it might frighten some younger children for a moment, so be warned.

I think a lot of the negativity this movie has received is down to the fact that at one point, the bad guy of the film (Hugh Laurie) spells out just how horrible people are and that their impending doom is entirely down to their own fault. There is a little speech that essentially blames people for their own lack of foresight and bone-idleness, which has led them to the brink of destruction.

Now, I normally might find this sort of thing preachy and condescending, but it fits well in the context of the movie. However, some people, I think, aren't able to have fun poked at them and seem to have taken an unnecessary amount of offence at this, and taken it out on the movie as a whole.

Despite this darker tone, the movie as a whole paints a hopeful vision, showing us that we can change our future if we really want to. The ending is a little cheesy, but it is a good kind of cheese, with the message that it is never too late to make a change.

Overall, the movie is just a fun flick for kids and their parents. Older teens might be bored a little, but younger kids will love it. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed for what it is.

Oh and for the person that suggested the movie was unsuitable for any child under fourteen, your kids have my sympathies. Oh my God! Their lives must be filled with so much cotton wool padding that they are perpetually on the verge of smothering to death. Good job!

SUMMARY: Way more fun than its rating would have you believe. Generally harmless entertainment of a family nature. Don't take the negativity seriously, because the movie never takes itself seriously. Its fun, that's all there is to it.

Who would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the last five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was a pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a grand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great as always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost steals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a very bright future in the acting business.

The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations of future aesthetic in the same film.

In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film. Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between actors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot choices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the film nicely.

Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces, nephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant architecture.

The fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it does absolutely astonishes me, I'm very critical when it comes to movies with a "environmental message" like this, but I had no problem with it, it was delivered in a fun laid-back tone, and Clooney's performance was very sarcastic and cynical, I loved this movie for that reason. I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this.

It simply tells a great story revealing "secrets" of the great minds of previous generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting laws that apply to "Tomorrowland" 

5/7 would watch again.

I mean, don't be surprised. 

Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade, an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists, jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length. Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious, inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch talent. 

But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves. It makes its moral pretty clear.

The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy', 'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time. 

That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow. I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!

I went into this with somewhat low expectations, do to the poor box office. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was visually amazing. The cinematography was so well done. A perfect combination of CGI and interesting set locations. 

Acting and casting was superb. Britt Robertson is one of the most compelling young actresses. She has brought her A game to the big screen. 

If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into almost every film these days, Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear proliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's., the plot is actually clever. I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen it in 3d. I think it may have a cult following in the future

Absolutely lovely! I'm 17 and saw this with my 8 year old brother, and we both loved it! Dazzling special effects. Great Disney nostalgia right from the beginning. Really good acting, particularly on 11/12 year old Raffey Cassidy's behalf, who manages to be both convincingly robotic and also human enough to be empathized with. George Clooney plays George Clooney as usual, what else could you ask for? The film also has some pleasantly thought-provoking themes that left me wondering whether the villain was truly evil or not. To add to this, the ultimate message of optimism that shines throughout the film is something lacking somewhat in films these days, and really makes this one stand out from the crowd in the glut of super-high budget family films that have been produced in the last few years.

Now, important to add is that this is very much a kids' film. So maybe not an appropriate film to see with your college or work mates on a night out. And naturally, don't go and see this expecting masterful, subtle storytelling or realistic dialogue. The story and dialogue are both unabashedly silly, but quite frankly, why on earth would anyone care? Don't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece. Honestly, just sit back, let down your critical barriers and enjoy the magic of cinema.

And one more thing: If you're reading this in time, this is DEFINITELY a film to see in the cinema while you can. Get the benefit of the big screen and surround sound while you can.

Sorry that this review is so late in the day. I have only just recently got around to seeing Tomorrowland. All the acting performances in this movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate. The soundtrack too is especially good. A great soundtrack improves a story enormously. I decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the dialogue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the narrative better. I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of Tomorrowland.

I will try to be simple:

The good: Direction, original story, performance (especially the two young actresses), FX. A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them, very touching.

The bad: ... It's supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at all.

The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small achievement, an odyssey.

If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don't hesitate to see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;)

Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures, but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of something really beautiful. Finally, I see some comments about an over-acted Britt Robertson, but if you have seen some of her works before, maybe you can see that the little histrionism that she injected in her character is very intentional, and then you will see the talent of this great actress.

"In a world where values, commitment, common sense, courage, curiosity, and thinking capacity are weakening, this movie is a beacon of hope for children... and adults too".

This is a great movie. As a show, as piece of art, as a good story, good action, and even good plot. I think it is misunderstood(perhaps too intellectual for most US people?).

This world is full of scares such as global warming, pop. explosion, energy crisis, terrorist attacks, nuclear explosion, etc. It is like some global endemic and if you do not agree with those scares and no sympathetic to those gloomy future of us , you are not or not a good person even. 

This story has a great value. It is not a corny some fairy tale. It has all the cinematic components as a good movie, too. Good actors.

This movie really took a person's imagination to a whole new level.

The story was interesting, and keeps a person engaged with what is happening. It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger.

Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability. It was going to one day change the world as it is. He was able to do just that. Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world. With the help from Casey Newton, played by Britt Robertson, Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago.

This movie has a simple story, and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination.

I watched the trailer for this and it seemed like way to many things were happening in this movie. This meant that when i had the time to sit down and relax to watch it, i changed my mind and watched Maze Runner - Scorch Trials instead. This is a mistake that should not be made as that was so bad i can barely describe it.

Anyways i decided i would watch it even though the trailer was a mess, and what a pleasant surprise. It was not messy in any way and it got me hooked from very early on. 

It has amazing visuals, great casting and a very meaningful story. 

Rafael Cassidy (Athena) did an amazing job. At such a young age to pull off such a performance is rarely seen, and given the right chances she could be worth to follow through her career. Clooney is good but not spectacular as his character is not great in the beginning. He catches up though. Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one to watch in the future.

The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after watching the movie. It heads off with some background story before nicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we follow Casey around though thick and thin. 

Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5 and therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.

I almost did not watch this movie due to the lower rating - thankfully the first review I read praised the acting and movie set. For that reason, I wanted to share a review highlighting the cast lineup which was phenomenal! Who could ask for more than having Hugh Laurie and George Clooney and Tim McGraw in the same feature movie! The special effects were "out of this world" (Please excuse the pun). This sci-fi story brings to the forefront the deliberate abuse that we are heaping on our Earth and that we are knowingly doing nothing to make a change. It speaks to never losing hope and to always keep the dreams alive. It was worth every minute of watching and is very entertaining and family friendly. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me and a movie that I would watch again.

This is not the full-on action movie that the trailer suggests. It is much better than that.

Tomorowland combines humour, action, great adventure, sharp script, thoughtfulness and social commentary in a thoroughly enjoyable package. And robots. Robots are always good. Especially killer robots with, 'have a nice day,' smiles.

So when the preaching arrives about the sorry state of our society you won't mind. It's damning truth is balanced by our hero's desire and ability to do something about it.

A memory that I took away from this movie is the story of the two wolves. I forget the exact words but one is despair and the other is hope. They are always fighting. Which one wins? The one that you feed! So we all just have to feed the right wolf.

And don't worry that this film might actually try to teach you something. Don't forget - it has smiley, killer robots!
