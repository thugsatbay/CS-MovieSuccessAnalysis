### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Many of the aspects of this film, in fact all of the aspects of this film, are great, bar one. Unfortunately, that aspect is the most important. The cinematography is outstanding, capturing amazing scenes and putting Turner in his paintings before he's painted them. The scenery in the period locations is also first class. The acting is perfect - the maid, Hannah, Turner, his father - in fact all the cast are excellent. But what lets it down, and what is unforgivable, is that even with an understanding of Turner's life this "biopic" doesn't tell a story. It is an endless series of scenes that attempt to be clever and give you a thousand windows into his life. But those windows are just that - they don't hint at a broader life, they just give you an impression of the man that you could get from a ten second description of him. The critics, I think, forgive a lack of story, but viewers - quite rightly - expect something more. There can be no spoilers for this film, there's no story to spoil.

Mike Leigh's "Mr Turner", a 2 1/2 hour movie had me so fascinated that it flew by. As an enraptured audience member I felt like a fly on the wall to witness Mr. Turner's life and creations of art that were depicted with such extraordinary realism. I felt on a gut level how this man's wonderful art was inspired by his feelings and the world surrounding him. There were so many wonderfully chosen moments and the scenery was so detailed and - thank God- lacking any Hollywood glamour. The characters were extremely well researched and portrayed to such a degree that I had the feeling I got to live in 1850's England for the 2 1/2 hours. There was not one moment of "acting' in this movie. How refreshing and inspiring! Timothy Spall's portrayal of Mr Turner was amazing in its detail - He inhabited the role 100 %. He embodied the painter to the last brush stroke. Equally wonderful were the women and everybody else in this brilliantly crafted movie. I shall see it again in case I have missed any detail.

We always knew that "Mr Turner" would not be a conventional costume picture any more than it would be a conventional biopic. It is, after all, a Mike Leigh film and Mr Leigh doesn't do 'conventional'. Of course, he normally concerns himself with the vagaries of contemporary middle-class culture, poking fun at, and then finding the bleeding heart of, the little people who inhabit his very personal world. (Leigh is, perhaps, the only writer/director who can crack us up and break our hearts simultaneously).

"Mr Turner" isn't the first time he has looked to the past nor to real historical figures for his material. With "Topsy-Turvy" he created the world of Gilbert and Sullivan and 'The Mikado'. As musical biopics go it is, perhaps, unique. Now with "Mr Turner" he takes us deep into the life of William Turner, arguably the first great 'modern' painter and almost certainly the greatest of all English painters, and in doing so has created the least stuffy costume picture I have ever seen. Of the several masterpieces Leigh has given us "Mr Turner" may be the finest.

It begins when Turner was already in middle-age and established as England's premier painter and it follows him until his death. It reveals him to be a man of many contradictions, sharing his later life mainly with two women, (he had long since disregarded his shrewish wife and grown-up daughters whose very existence he always denied). For sexual favours he turned to his housekeeper Hannah Danby while preferring the company of the widow Mrs Booth with whom he lodged part of the year in Margate, (Danby never knew of Booth's existence until just before Turner's death). He could be both cruel and kind in equal measure, both to his contemporaries and to those he professed to care about and he certainly had a temper.

We don't learn a great deal about his technique as a painter though we do see him, briefly, at work, including a wonderful scene, one of several great set-pieces, where he adds a daub of paint to one of his canvases at the Royal Academy's Exhibition. It's not really that kind of film. Leigh is more interested in observing the man and getting inside his skull and in this he is greatly helped by Timothy Spall's magnificent performance as Turner, capturing the man mostly in a series of grunts. Spall's Turner doesn't go for deep, philosophical conversations on the nature of art. He seems happiest making small-talk with Mrs Booth and when, in another of the film's great set-pieces, the conversation veers into the critical appraisal of a fellow artist he is quick to debunk the pretentious John Ruskin who obviously likes the sound of his own lisping voice.

Spall, of course, is just the lynch-pin of a terrific ensemble. No-one puts a foot wrong, (including Leigh regulars Ruth Sheen and Lesley Manville), but one must really single out Dorothy Atkinson as the unfortunate and much maligned Danby and Marion Bailey as Mrs Booth. Both women are superb, giving us characters that are much more than mere historical sketches. There is something deeply moving in their silent acceptance of Turner's foibles, (and while Leigh's dialogue is splendidly 'of the period', it's often in the silences that the film is most effective). Credit, too, to Dick Pope's superb cinematography which captures perfectly the paintings without seeming in any way slavish. Indeed, of all films made about artists this may be the finest. I don't doubt for a moment that it's a masterpiece.

Four years ago, Mike Leigh released one of the finest films of his  oeuvre. I saw Another Year at the London Film Festival gala premiere  and I still consider it the only perfect film of this decade thus far.  As a result, expectations for his long awaited followup Mr. Turner were  very high. Especially as it's ostensibly his most ambitious, even  moreso than Topsy-Turvy, also a period drama, that ultimately won 2  Oscars, the only Oscars any of his films ever won. Nevertheless, he's  frequently a gift basket receiver at the ceremonies, garnering  obligatory screenplay nominations and the odd directing nom, the last  of which being for Vera Drake 10 years ago. His organic storytelling,  balance of abstract concepts, ability to orchestrate extraordinary  performances and his sardonic sense of humour resonate with critics and  audiences alike.  
However, he's not always a crowd pleaser, and Mr. Turner in particular  has divided audiences, though not enough to hinder its current awards  progress. It's clear to see why. This biopic of the visionary 19th  century artist J.M.W. Turner is dense and cryptic. In Leigh's  impeccable attention to detail, not just in the production and costume  designs, the language is authentic to the convoluted dialect of the  upper class of the period and thus it's hard to follow the sparse plot,  even for fans. It's unusual for Leigh to adapt a true story, he often  starts from scratch, but true to his form his script here defies  traditional structure. It's a liberating free form style, sampling  scattered moments of Turner's life, not building to anything specific  but just exploring what shaped his idiosyncratic perspective. As a  result, the film has grit hard to find elsewhere, and although it's  difficult to decipher, it's enchanting for some.  
Headlining the film is Timothy Spall's colossal performance. He's  always been a highlight of Leigh's films when he's been involved,  especially his knock out performances in Secrets & Lies and All Or  Nothing. This is the role he was born to play. Tossing narrative aside,  the film's primary concern is the character study of Turner, a  brilliant but flawed man, and each sequence adds layers upon layers of  dimensions to him as they swirl in anguish. Spall wears those emotions  on his sleeve with a perpetual sneer, grumbly grunts and a piercing  stare. The moments where he breaks down have the weight of an  earthquake. He's at once a force of nature and has a tender  vulnerability. But as illustrated by the exquisite opening shot, he is  above all a man of his art and watching Turner paint with a chaotic  elegance is fascinating, especially as the results develop over the  film.  
The ensemble around Spall gives ample support, including the fleeting  appearances from familiar faces such as the seething Ruth Sheen as the  bitter mother of his estranged children and the delightful Lesley  Manville as a sprightly scientist who conducts an art orientated  experiment. The standouts however are the warm glow of Marion Bailey,  Turner's landlady of his second home and mistress, and the anxious  agony of Dorothy Atkinson, Turner's housekeeper who he frequently  engages in sex but who suffers from a disfiguring skin disease. Bailey  has her great moments, especially when she's overwhelmingly flattered,  but Atkinson in particular has such heartbreaking conviction that she  bursts from the background of her scenes.  
What makes the film Leigh's most ambitious project is the  cinematography. He's always had a great eye for blocking and making the  kitchen sink cinematic, but Dick Pope's work here broke the mould. It's  obvious to call it Turner-esque, but that's the intention. It's almost  like a David Lean precision of waiting for a cloud to move in the right  place. It was indeed whenever Leigh and Pope encountered landscapes  like this on other films that inspired them to pursue this film. Some  shots cover more ground than he covered in the entirety of his early  films. Not only are the outside shots beautifully composed, but also  the inside, using wide angles to keep the grand scale. A collaborator  since Happy-Go-Lucky, composer Gary Yershon's forlorn oboe contributes  to the rich ominous tone. It's interesting that for a film about art  and colour that it's saturated with browns, blacks and greys.  
The inherently meandering plot does lead it to becoming bloated, but it  attempt to be an insight the many different facets of Turner's life and  how that feeds into his work, something applicable to all the great  artists. It also considers themes of legacy, one perhaps self-aware in  hindsight, but important in context. It's a complex film, and it needs  another viewing until I'm fully ready to embrace it. As like life, it  ends unresolved and I'm still not sure what to make of it. I must be  one of the few people who didn't feel it was too long, but only because  I was hungry for something more conclusive. Leigh doesn't make it easy  for us, but gives us everything to work with. For what I can digest so  far, it's a gargantuan achievement.  
Due to that inaccessibility and the length of the film, awards  attention outside of critic's awards is unlikely. Perhaps it could get  a couple of BAFTA nominations, Leigh is not the sweeper people think he  is there but it will no doubt get noms for Spall and Best British Film.  If there were any justice, it would get Cinematography, Production  Design and Costume Design across the board as for even people who  didn't like the film can't deny their prowess. Leigh may miss out on  that Original Screenplay nomination as the film is looser than his  usual output, but particularly because the dialogue needs a double  take. It is going to be difficult to imagine where Leigh will go from  here but Mr. Turner duly satisfies a thirst for now.  
9/10

Mike Leigh is perhaps best-known for his serio-comic social-realist dramas about contemporary British life, films like "Abigail's Party" and "Life Is Sweet", but he also seems to be developing a sideline in biographies of nineteenth-century cultural figures. First there was "Topsy-Turvy" about Gilbert and Sullivan, and now we have "Mr. Turner" about the life and career of the artist J. M. W. Turner. Or rather about the latter part of his life and career; when we first meet him he is already middle-aged. 

Leigh has described Turner as "a great artist: a radical, revolutionary painter," and this is undoubtedly true; Turner's work, especially his later work, seems to prefigure Impressionism, perhaps at times even abstract Modernism. We must not, however, allow our appreciation of the progressive side of Turner's work to degenerate into that lazy cliché about the great artist starving in a garret, scorned or neglected by his contemporaries but later discovered by a grateful posterity. (Very few great artists, except perhaps Van Gogh, have ever conformed to this stereotype). He was greatly admired by his contemporaries, was praised in the highest terms by many critics, especially Ruskin, became a full Royal Academician while still in his twenties, never lacked for patrons and died a wealthy man. By contrast his great contemporary and rival, John Constable, whose art seems much less radical to our eyes, had a much harder struggle to establish himself. 

Leigh's purpose in making the film was to "examine the tension between this very mortal, flawed individual, and the epic work, the spiritual way he had of distilling the world." This tension is something very obvious in the film. Turner, especially in later life, was noted for his eccentricity. Unlike many working-class Georgians and Victorians who rose in the world, he never attempted to hide his humble origins. He was untidy, had no social graces and could be rude and tactless. He never married but had a number of mistresses. He was estranged from the first of these, Sarah Danby, and refused to acknowledge his two illegitimate daughters by her. (Sarah appears in the film as do two other mistresses, Hannah Danby Sarah's niece and Turner's housekeeper and Sophia Booth, a seaside landlady). 

And yet this uncouth, boorish-seeming man was an artist not only of genius but also of a deep spirituality. His obsession with accurately recording light and atmospheric conditions- he once had himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he could paint a snowstorm- was born not only of a concern with fidelity to nature but also of a belief that light was a visible manifestation of the Divine. (His last words are said to have been "The sun is God"). 

How, then, could any actor hope to play so contradictory an individual? The answer to this question comes from Timothy Spall, one of Leigh's favourite actors. Spall is someone I have normally thought of as a "character actor", but here he gets the chance to prove himself as a leading man and makes the most of it. His Turner is a grumpy old man, and in his dealings with women something of a dirty old man as well, forever grunting and spitting and forever speaking in a sort of Cockney whine, and yet we are never allowed to forget that underneath his unpromising exterior he is a sublime artist. This is probably the finest performance I have seen Spall give; it won him "Best Actor" at the Cannes Film Festival and I hope that the Academy will bear him in mind when it comes to next year's Oscars. There is insufficient space to single out all the deserving supporting performances, although I should mention Martin Savage as Turner's friend and fellow-painter Benjamin Haydon, forever trying to borrow money off him, Paul Jesson as Turner's father, to whom he was very close, and Joshua McGuire in a comic turn as an effeminate, lisping Ruskin, very different to the way Greg Wise portrayed him in the recent "Effie Gray". 

The other outstanding feature of the film is its visual beauty. Leigh and his cinematographer Dick Pope were clearly aiming to make it one of those films where every shot looks like a painting in its own right, and certainly succeed in this ambition. Some cinematic biographies of great artists, such as "Girl with a Pearl Earring" about Vermeer, do succeed in capturing the distinctive "look" of their subject, but I think that Leigh and Pope were not actually aiming to make every shot look like a Turner; their palette of colours, for example, is rather too muted for that. Possibly they felt that the peculiar luminosity of Turner's work would be too difficult to reproduce on film. There are, however, some memorable shots, such as the opening scene by the river in Holland, complete with windmill, and the one where Turner watches "the fighting Temeraire" being towed up the Thames, thereby getting the inspiration for one of his best-known works. 

I am not sure if "Mr Turner" quite justifies the label "masterpiece" which some have tried to pin on it; it can at times be too slow-moving for that. Spall's wonderful acting, however, and Pope's striking cinematography make it a film that stands out from the crowd. 8/10

Let's start with the good - it's beautifully shot and acted. That's it. The film lacks any element of storyline. It begins with a shot of Turner in Holland. But why? We're never told. He goes to Margate to paint. But why there instead of some other part of Britain? We're never told. He gets tied to the mast of a ship in a storm. But that's almost a stand-alone scene. His housekeeper has some sort of progressive disease but we're never told what it is or why she had it. I believe that Turner had a fairly contentious relationship with Constable but all we get here is a very brief scene in which Constable walks out in response to what he considers to be a slight on the part of Turner. If the relationship was as acrimonious as I believe it's reported to have been, couldn't Mike Leigh have used this to greater effect? 

Overall the film looks as if somebody has been through a biography of Turner, used a highlighter pen to pick out important episodes and they've been stitched together as a complete piece. As a result, the movie is nothing more than a series of largely disjointed vignettes and represents 3 hours in a cinema to no good effect.

First: if you think the film-event of the year is the latest James Bond, then, obviously you should not go and see this film. (There are so many reviewers here with the opinion that this is a boring, plot less film that this seems to be something needing to be pointed out.) In fact, what we have here is a film with much humour, acted out in scenes and in somewhat appropriately arcane dialogue. There is drama and touching depictions of the human condition. And as for plot, we are given some engaging beautiful scenes from the life of Mr. Turner, as indeed we would have learnt to expect from Mr.Mike Leigh. Personally, if I had to name a favourite Mike Leigh film, it would have been All Or Nothing, but now, after experiencing this rich tapestry of depth, history and beauty, I have to conclude that the film Mr.Turner is so far, for all involved in this project of collaboration, a most profound crowning achievement. Take part of it with open eyes, ears, hearts and minds.

No need for me to repeat what others have more eloquently expressed (Martin Bradley's review in particular), but this is a rare work of cinematic brilliance, profound, moving and truly original. True, it is not for everyone, and, yes, it has no conventional linear plot, but no story? The story is embedded within each of the marvelous vignettes, if one has but eyes to see, and the patience to pull them all together. And they do pull together by the end to present before us the multi- faceted story of a richly complex and conflicted human life. But there are other stories as well, in particular the women in Mr. Turner's life, most poignant of all the story of his long suffering housekeeper. Alas, many on this review site lack such eyes, and I'm saddened by that fact and what it reveals about our contemporary cultural standards. Ignore the naysayers, this is a masterpiece of profound humanity and insight that deserves multiple viewings. Personally, I was mesmerized by the film from beginning to end and will give it a second viewing tomorrow. And I ain't no film critic with high literary pretensions, nor do I know anything about art. 

Three quarters of the way through the film, there is a scene with Queen Victoria viewing some of Turner's landscapes and sputtering her disapproval with high indignation. Behind her are a number of cackling philistines, twittering and giggling their disapproval as well. How ironic, when one considers the treatment of the film being meted out by some reviewers on IMDb. 

In 1956, Samuel Beckett's play, Waiting for Godot premiered at the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris, and confounded the critics of the time. It was lambasted for defying the traditional conventions of drama, for having no plot, no recognizable beginning, middle and end, and for being utterly boring. Yet today it is justly recognized as one of the masterpieces of modern drama. Mike Leigh's film may very well be the finest cinematic treatment of a great artist ever displayed on celluloid.

I saw this film last night, in a good cinema with a good screen and new projector and the reason I start off with this will become apparent soon. The film is quite stunning. We sort of drop in to Turner's life at a random point and we follow it on from there. It is not plot-heavy - we are simply viewers of what is happening to this man. Some of what happens to this man are dull and we see a bit of that too. I'm going to analyse the film in a moment, but overall, this is a brilliant film. In the small cinema you could have heard a pin drop - everyone was spellbound. Sometimes when I see a film, my mind drifts to other things, but not during Mr Turner. I was transfixed and left the cinema with that feeling you only get from seeing a masterpiece.

OK, now let's break it down. Mike Leigh is a supremely good director. He allows time for the story. He does not go if for quick cutting - scenes are long and we watch the actors move as though from the far side of the room. This is a relaxing and engaging technique that aspiring directors would do well to copy. His screenplay provides the backbone to the whole film, and it is crafted so well - capturing just who this man Turner is. 

Film-goers seem to be interested in stars and actors but to me, actors are just actors - they are two a penny. The real stars are the creative people - Leigh of course and in this case Dick Pope the DOP who has surpassed himself here. The film is visually stunning - which is why you need to see it in a good cinema that gets the best out of the visual image, not a tacky popcornplex. Ask your cinema manager what projectors they use and don't go there if they are not modern top quality units. Dick's camera positioning, his lighting, his colour palate and his camera movement which he uses very sparely are a joy to observe. He does his own operating and that shows. No fast zooming or unnecessary camera movement, no clever stuff. Just visually stunning. Shot on Alexa Plus - the best digital camera - and with beautiful Cooke Speed Panchro Lenses that together produce a better than film-like quality. Oh, and nice to see the sound recordist in the opening credits, because hearing the words clearly as well as the Foley and other sounds is really important - you don't want to struggle to hear things when you are enraptured with the pictures.

Having been a bit disparaging about actors generally, they are all good in this film as you might expect, and Tim Spall's Turner has lashings of character. But, this is where I would be tempted to mark this film down to an 8 from an otherwise 10. I know that Turner was an larger-than-life character but I think it goes just a bit too far - there just too much grunting and strutting about - it all gets a bit waring after a while - nobody would really be like that all the time. Of course, that is down to Leigh who clearly wanted Spall to bring the character to full life like this. I've seen Spall so often in films and on the TV and he often ends up in parts that require larger-than-life acting. His superb Fagin in Oliver Twist for example. He is not an actor who over acts, but a great character actor who is able to magnify his character when the director demands it. Fortunately for us and him, he is not a "film star" - just an ordinary guy who happens to be a very professional character actor. But, actually, all that grunting and strutting is very entertaining and adds a spice to an otherwise factual film - so back to 9! 

At two and a half hours, this is a long film and it has a slow pace, but is is never less than 100% engaging. It is a perfect example of the sort of film we in the UK do so very very well, whilst the US churns out ridiculous hack action movies that are forgotten by the time you get home. If you appreciate true quality and don't mind a bit of grunting, you will not be disappointed.

p.s This film deserves to be seen at a good cinema - it looses a lot visually on a TV.

I don't know how anyone sat through all two and a half hours of this at one go in the theater. It took me four sessions to get through it all.

It is a series of largely unconnected scenes, most very short. There is no arc. Turner finally dies, but you don't feel that you know much about him. Nor do you care.

I don't expect a feature film to be a documentary. Hamlet, after all, evidently tells us very little about the real Prince of Denmark of that name. But I do expect a feature film to develop its characters, make us come to understand them, and perhaps even care about them, or care about something. This movie did not do that for me at all. And that was very disappointing, as I really love Turner's paintings.

There are some beautiful, if very short, scenes of gorgeous English countryside, but nothing comes of them. There are lots of scenes that make no sense by themselves. The young Ruskin, for example, comes off as a pretentious fop, but if you don't know it from other sources you would never know from this movie that that young fop would become one of the most influential writers on art for the next century, both in England and in France. We see Constable, and Turner's addition to one of his canvases, but the movie gives us no idea who Constable is, whether he was any different from the many other painters we see in that scene, etc. Just a lot of names. If a movie is going to introduce historical figures, then it should in fact introduce them. It's not sufficient to just run them by us.

In short, I was very disappointed by this movie. A good editor might make something of it by cutting it down an hour and filming some transitions, but I don't know that it would be worth the effort.

It was disappointing. My wife says if she'd been watching it at home on cable she'd have given up after the first hour.

Great photography, locations and high production values but:

* At nearly 3 hours it's awfully long.

* The story line meanders a lot. You couldn't say there was a plot as such.

* The modern cult of authentic accents means for most of the film you can't tell what the heck anyone is saying. One of those modernistic productions where everyone mumbles a lot.

* Panning and tracking shots are blurry. I guess that's a result of digital filming but it's annoying. You keep waiting for the shot to stabilise so the scene detail is revealed. 

* When the film starts Turner has already developed his signature style. You are left with the impression he had always painted like that. Not so. In a recent cable doco, which was more interesting, it was explained the he was a highly skilled conventional draughtsman and artist well before he went on to paint in the style of 'The Fighting Temeraire'.

* And there's that gratuitous sex scene with his housekeeper. Ludicrous...and physically impossible.

I was transfixed by this movie. You can say if you want that it is a film which lasts 2 and a half hours in which nothing happens. But, on the other hand, every frame is conceived as a sort of Turner painting. The result is breathtakingly beautiful, I have never enjoyed a movie more. The film starts in 1825 or so and shows the last 25 years of Turners life, so he is already an established artist when the film begins.

The film shows incidents in the artist's life. One or two are superfluous like the scene where the Queen and Prince Albert are looking at paintings, including Turner's at the Royal Academy. This should have been left on the cutting room floor as it adds nothing to the film. There is also a minor goof when Turner is woken by his housekeeper having slept in his clothes and it looks like his shirt was freshly pressed that morning.

But, a couple of minor goofs aside, this is the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. I was in tears at the end and screen deaths don't normally affect me at all.

I've been a fan of Mike Leigh's films for years. They have been funny, emotional and dramatic, sometimes all at the same time. In a recent interview he stated that this is the 20th film he has made without a script - and believe me it shows. It goes absolutely nowhere and tells you nothing about Turner that you don't already know. The critics seem to have been crawling up each other's trousers to praise this film. Yes, it's well acted and it's beautifully filmed = but that's it. There is NO STORY at all. I went with five other people (all art students) and we all found it incredibly boring. This is yet another example of professional critics getting it completely wrong. Don't be fooled by them. They've been wrong before. Avoid this film at all costs. It's beautiful by empty. It's the Emperor's New Clothes.

As in 'Topsy-Turvy' Mike Leigh marvellously captures the historical context of the creative artist. He gives us the struggles flesh-and-blood people go through in creating art, and the often tragic spectacle of their artistic struggles makes us admire and wonder at their achievements all the more. In both biographical films Mike Leigh shows us that without our common human frailty there can be no sublimity. He shows us achievement hard-won. This is to appreciate the real genius of 99% perspiration. Except that the film of 'Mr Turner' is executed on a far greater canvas (if I may so express it). 'Topsy-Turvy' like its subjects - Gilbert and Sullivan, and the world of the early musical - is brilliant; but 'Mr Turner' is a work of genius - completely worthy of its great subject. The saddest thing is to see reviewer after reviewer grudgingly acknowledging the sheer technical finesse of the whole enterprise, only to end by condemning the 'episodic' nature of the film. If they realized the lengths Mike Leigh and his team went to in their endeavour to be faithful to the social and artistic milieux, and - more especially - to the living memory of J.M.W. Turner, they could not say such a thing. Scene follows scene so effortlessly, so apparently artlessly, that it recalls the great fluency of the Nouvelle Vague, whose ideal was that events should appear in the camera, and on the screen, as if they had just occurred, in exactly the way that life experiences accumulate - before they have been reduced to any mechanical and contrived order. And yet every scene achieves a perfect realisation. This is the achievement of a director - and a crew - who can make a living, breathing truth out of film. This is cinematic poetry. But in making it's great subject real, like the rest of us, instead of elevating him into something superhuman, Leigh diverges radically from the current inhuman hyperbole of the Hollywood machine. Like the artist Leigh has portrayed here, the epic scale of his inspiration is at one with his subject: But unlike a Hollywood film where they like to show their muscles even when they are thinking, there is no straining for effect. The film is as monumental yet intimate, as real yet as sublime as those grand canvases. Leigh has painted the passionate yet private soul of Turner in light. His film is a miracle of rare device. It is a masterpiece.

Mike Leigh, I feel, is an incredibly talented filmmaker and I've seen pretty much all of his movies. Timothy Spall is also enormously talented, and I've enjoyed his performances in many films.

However here in Leigh's latest I just couldn't buy in. First of all, it stretches way too long, in my opinion, at over two and a half hours. Secondly, it offers virtually nothing about how the illustrious painter J.M.W. Turner was able to produce the fabulous artwork that came from his brush.

The movie focuses on the latter years of Turner (Spall), and we see him being terribly boorish while grimacing and grousing throughout, but nary anything on what inspired him or enabled him to paint like he did. Only in the final hour of the biopic do we see some of his personal characteristics that made him more of a person and not a caricature.

On the positive side, the film is impeccably shot, bringing that period of history to the screen, with the costumes and set designs. In supporting roles, Dorothy Atkinson is simply amazing as Hannah, the mentally challenged housekeeper, relative, and part-time assistant to Turner, who seemingly adored him and allowed him to take advantage of her with his sexual proclivities. Also, Marion Bailey, Paul Jesson, and Joshua McGuire added much to the movie.

All in all, I unfortunately felt like this Leigh film just came way too close to pretentiousness, although it had it's moments. As mentioned, I would have really liked to know what made Turner tick and not just sit through two and a half hours of why he was so eccentric and boorish.

Amazing Movie! My husband and I saw it yesterday and LOVED IT! I am an American who owns all of Mike Leigh's films. His films are one of a kind! They give you a glimpse into people's lives. Either an historical person or in most of his films he shows us regular everyday people. The cinematography is breathtaking. This movie made me feel as if I had traveled back in time and I actually felt like I was watching Turner go about his day to day life. It was fascinating to me and not just to see his life but to watch how people ate, dressed, partied, spoke and the interworking of their relationships . It also gave us a glimpse into different social classes at that period in time in England. When I came out of the movie I felt as if I had been there with the character at that time. It gave me so much more than any other movie experience has! BRAVO MIKE LEIGH!!!!!!!!

Yet another overlong movie, that feels like a documentary. The plot-free story is about the life of celebrated British painter Turner. 

We follow mumbling, eccentric and slightly unpleasant Turner around, while he interacts with friends an family. We get glimpses of spectacular landscapes and the creative process of painting, bits and pieces of boring conversation, more family trouble, until Turner's death.

Nothing is explained, as if it would give the audience too much information and some characters feel weird, such as Turner's housekeeper, who looks and acts in a bizarre way and ends up disfigured by a mysterious illness. Turned out she had psoriasis, but I had to find out the information online.

I am a cinephile.

I can easily do difficult movies. Under The Skin. The White Ribbon. Cache. Jeez I can do all the tough stuff.

I am a Mike Leigh-phile too.

Secrets and Lies, Naked, Life is Sweet, Abigail';s Party, Nuts in May. All brilliant.

I am a Timothy Spall-phile also. (Just too many to mention)

And so I approached Mr Turner with gusto. I like Turner's seascapes very much. What is there not to like?

It turns out, quite a lot.

To cut to the chase this is one of the dullest 2.5 hours I have spent in a cinema in many a long year. Turgid, plot less, meandering, self-indulgent claptrap of the highest order.

The cinematography has its moments but it takes a lot of moments to make a movie.

There are scenes that are enjoyable, largely in the Royal Academy and one in particular when Constable is ridiculed by Turner but overall it is a study in very dull misogyny that the world is probably no worse without.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the development of his supposed housekeeper Hannah Dandy's (Dorothy Atkinson) eczema. Was she, or was she not, Turner's wife/mistress/muse? 

Who cares.

Turner-phile ladies sat behind me in the audience and whispered throughout. Damn them.

Mike Leigh's worst film by a country mile.

Sorry Mike. I really am.

I did write originality, but what I meant by that is - reality. The more realistic the movie is - the more dissatisfaction of the viewers it gets. Here are so many people indicating that the movie "is boring", "it's not entertaining"... Isn't that what life is like?...boring, and imagine being like an old man such as Turner portrayed in the movie - it would be rather boring. I thank god there are directors, who make movies without thinking how to entertain the audience. Every story tells you what it needs itself, you don't have to be extra original (the originality is there - if it's real). There is no chance this movie could be entertaining, you know it's not when you're somewhat familiar with Turner's biography and knowing that the movie shows the painter as an old man. I would very much like people to see reason, that movies are not bad if they don't entertain...God, just think about what kind of century we're living in: We are full of clichés, stereotypes, meaningless images and symbols, spirituality, we create imaginary self, then we promote it, we lie more than ever, and we are constantly seeking the entertainment, we don't want to spend our dear lives on something that looks boring, and even it is boring, don't necessarily dislike it, if you don't see a reason - don't necessarily judge it... Don't reject the originality, in fact, please: don't ever reject the originality. That's the reaction Turner was probably getting - lot of people rejected his kind of art...and not just Turner - it happened at each stage of art history, you're just being the same sort of sarcastic people, who reject the unusual, who always need things to be or look their way. People want to see the reviews (I think that is the purpose of the comment section), not who's entertained and who's not. HERE YOU ARE: The movie is: Real/true, beautiful (the scenes, the cinematography. there is a great deal of attempt to show the environment as it was/could have been around Turner, as well as showing the scenes that made his pictures), well thought story, you don't feel the script (that's a good thing actually, takes a lot of effort to make an audience feel like they are observing a real person's life, following him, attending the same places), acting is brilliant (needless to say - Timothy Spall is a genius). I saw the movie today and it was really worth spading 150 minutes of my life. 

My advise to you - who want to watch Mr.Turner is this: Be an accepting person - you will get more out of anything you see that way. Be bored and uninterested - the only times you'll find something new is by not looking for what you'd normally look for (if it's normally an entertainment). And of course: You decide for yourself - what's boring and what's-not.

P.S: It was wise of Mike Leigh to chose the 2.40:1 (I think) aspect ratio particularly for this move, It's the firs Mike Leigh film I saw, to have that aspect ratio (looked really appropriate).

A biopic that most critics have admired, but, in my opinion, except the beautiful photography and costumes what is presented to the spectator is an artist from which we'll just know his grin and grunt,and some grandiloquent phrases about painting. He and people around him are described grotesquely and only so. In one of the scenes a pig is prepared to be eaten and this perhaps is a summary of the life of Turner and the other painters in the story, according to Mike Leigh, who also wrote the script. He has built the film with a series of scenes which with some variations are essentially a repetition of the same behavior. Leigh has given to the natural landscapes more relevance than to the paintings by Turner,and it seems that the daily life of the artist was more interesting than his work. Two hours and a half are too much to suffer a wrong conception of one of the most talented British directors.

This film is not recommended.

He looks like a bulldog, grunts like a chimpanzee, bellows like a rhinoceros, and waddles like a duck. He's Mr. Turner, one of the most prolific and talented artists of the 19th century in one of the dullest film biographies of the 21st century. Mike Leigh's well-intentioned film celebrates the painter's life, but the end result is as exciting as watching paint dry.

Timothy Spall plays Mr. Turner, as repellently as possible. With a non-stop pout and lasting sneer, various guttural noises that represent dialog, and a stooped posture resembling Danny DeVito, the role, as written, stops this short of caricature. It is a bold performance that Mr. Spall delivers and the actor tries to valiantly add some substance to the eccentric part.

The film has some lovely details in its production values, with spot-on period costumes by Jacqueline Durran and exquisite art direction by Suzie Davies and Charlotte Watts, although Gary Yershon's music score becomes intrusive. Foremost is Dick Pope's ravishing photography which precisely captures Turner's lighting effects and painterly style to the nth degree.

But the real problem with the film is Leigh's rather conventional screenplay that plays like a straightforward art history lesson. It ever builds to any emotional engagement. The film takes the Amadeus approach in its storytelling, presenting a childish lout as the artist but without much dramatic flourish. It is essentially a character study that strings together some historically accurate vignettes which grow monotonous as the film relentlessly emphasizes the artist's boorish and self-centered ways. 

Leigh's direction has some fine moments, yet he allows too many scenes to languish for far too long. Judicious editing would have brought more clarity and needed energy to the film. Supporting characters remain sketchy at best, and so is Turner's acceptable erratic behavior.  At the core of the film is its weak plot structure. There's no compelling story either, just lots of gorgeous atmosphere to behold.

To say that this film is well crafted is faint praise. Leigh is a director who knows his craft. His planning and vision of this film is evident, even if his script lacks focus. But to say that his film is leisurely paced is an understatement as well. Mr. Turner is a visually stunning movie-going experience, but it is also emotionally inert and aloof. The film shed no new light on this gifted artist whose lighting and color work were his lasting legacy. Sadly, this film will quickly dim and fade from one's memory. GRADE: C+

I don't often write reviews of films I don't really like so I will try and be as constructive as possible and attempt to mention the positive whilst being critical to a large extent. I love Timothy Spall as an actor but felt his characterisation was both misguided and cliché ridden. A shame because clearly he worked very hard.I waited throughout the film to see a bit about painting but all I learnt was that at some point in his career Turner spat at his work presumably to enhance the ease with which he could move the paint around on the canvas. I learnt that he had a thing for his housekeeper, culminating in the worst filmed love making I have ever had to experience(I felt really sorry for both actors.)I struggled to hear or understand most of the 'Victorian Speak', (a huge cliché which did nothing except limit any understanding of what was being said)and yes the costumes and settings were quite pretty at times but so obvious was the set dressing that I felt as if the props folk had only just left the sets when filming rolled and it was all a bit obvious decoration to real locations.That said, the natural locations were filmed beautifully , all the correct filters were used to make us feel we were looking at the world 150 years ago but actually you can go and see those places now and such images turn up in all kinds of documentaries if filmed well.I think my feelings are best summed up by saying 'an opportunity lost' or an experience of 'unrealised potential', but maybe it just isn't that interesting having film 'about' when in fact we have the paintings he left us and we should get the story from them and not worry to much about whether he was in love with several women at the same time and treated none of them fairly as a consequence.In summing up, 'Great Paintings' 'worked too hard',acting, sadly not a great movie ..... interestingly I got that from the trailer and only went to see it against my better judgement. Should have listened to my better judgement and saved a fiver.

I'm hardly the target audience for this film. All I knew about Turner was that he engaged in screwing large dollops of paint onto canvas, mostly sombre in tone and which may, at a stretch, have resembled a sea or an ocean and upon which there may have been a ship, the kind of 'art' that I wouldn't cross the street to see. But fair dos; no one was actually asking me to cross the street to see them so that I was free to cross several streets to see a Breughel, Canaletto, or any other artist who was not ashamed to share with the viewer the object)s) he was actually depicting. I knew about Mike Leigh 1) he made at least one excellent film entitled Secrets and Lies which I enjoyed immensely and watched more than once, 2) like Preston Sturges, Alain Resnais etc he has what amounts to a repertory company, actors with whom he works again and again, 3) that he shamelessly stole the story of Vera Drake from a Claude Chabrol film with neither acknowledgment nor apology and 4) he is not averse to nepotism on the Brian Forbes scale, having employed his ex-wife Alison Steadman and current partner Marion Bailey in several projects ( the positive in this is that unlike Nanette Newman Ms. Steadman and Bailey can actually act). I also knew Timothy Spall as a fine actor who has never, to my knowledge, given even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one and on the strength of this plus the suspicion that it might just be a tad overrated, I ponied up at the box office for a basinfull of Mr. Turner. What I found was a reasonably interesting movie about a man who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries and appeared to be something of a gargoyle who communicated largely via grunts and appeared to be a respected artist - at least he was a member of the Royal Academy. We shared his company for some two and a half hours and that was that.

We regularly attend Roger Ebert's Film Festival and before Mr Ebert's death, Timothy Spall was one of the event's special guests. He was there for a showing of Hamlet, I think, and I remember that he was charming and more fun to listen to than I expected. I hadn't really thought of him as a particularly impressive actor but, once again, Roger was right to single him out.

His talents are in full display here enriched by one of the most meticulous productions I've ever seen. The supporting cast is as flawless as any lead could ever ask for, as if everyone could see how unusually good the movie was to become. I particularly enjoyed every move and word that came out of his housekeeper, Hannah, unforgettably played by Dorothy Atkinson.

The subject of the movie, the last part of the life of the English artist J M W Turner, is not the stuff of great drama. The man was an eccentric in his later years, and not a particularly pleasant man. But what sustains the movie is the brilliant insight into 19th century English life. Every one of those characters in English novels who never really quite felt true to life is made undeniably real here. And the thing is, it's being done by Englishmen who are not shying away from full disclosure.

The thing is I usually wait for the DVD with English movies so that I can use the captions, but our local art theater was so beckoning and as it turns out, I needn't have worried. Often the dialog was impossible to make out, but somehow it didn't matter at all. It's not that kind of movie. It's long, but not slow, and I at least enjoyed every minute of it. The opportunity to be enthralled by such talented people is no everyday thing.

Timothy Spall is a character actor of considerable skill, but he played Turner with one note: phlegmatic, complete with actual phlegm. He may have won the Best Actor award at Cannes, but his Turner is a grunting, rutting grotesque whose inevitable death comes as a relief. Because he is in every scene, his character in many ways IS the film, and his performance and appearance make watching it more like witnessing an accident than revealing a great artist. 

There are wonderful scenes -- the prism experiment, the scenes at the Royal Academy, and anything with Mrs. Booth (Marion Bailey)-- but they do not build. In fact, the movie approaches being actually disgusting more than a few times, and I don't even refer to the maidservant (Dorothy Atkinson) and her progressive skin disease. Such conditions certainly reflect the reality in the 19th century. But director Mike Leigh revels in the repulsive well beyond the needs of realism. 

Beyond that, MR. TURNER is bloated at 150 minutes, because so many of the scenes drag on and on. To be sure, the landscape photography by Dick Pope (a frequent Leigh collaborator) is beautiful, but the individuals are, like Spall's Turner, nearly all one-note grotesques. Humor is attempted occasionally, and achieved a few times. In at least one egregious case, however, the attempt is at a sophomoric sub- Python level: the insulting portrayal of the young John Ruskin (Joshua McGuire) as a lisping, pompous coxcomb, the object of everyone's ridicule and the possessor of no worthy opinions. Ruskin was famous for his sexual peculiarities, but his scholarly criticism was, and is, respected.

Finally, what was the point, the theme? It wasn't clear what connection Mike Leigh was trying to make between Turner's phlegm and his paintings, except for when Spall actually spat on canvases to moisten the paints. Perhaps Turner, who describes himself as a "gargoyle," inserted himself symbolically into his impressionistic landscapes, as the shipwreck, the belching train-- as the ugliness that contrasts with the beauty of nature, and thus makes us appreciate beauty more. That would be a nice point to make, but Leigh didn't make it, and I had to do a lot of interpreting to come up with it myself.
