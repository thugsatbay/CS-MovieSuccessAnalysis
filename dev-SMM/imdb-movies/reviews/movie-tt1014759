### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.

But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.

With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his "Tideland" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.

Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.

6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)

It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some "Disney moments" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.

The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals.

I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals, and jaw dropping set pieces, I found the movie to be incredibly dull, flat, and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents, and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue, to a feminine lisp, and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph, the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original, except a lot more Johnny Depp- a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for, but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice (the stone faced, newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned, mildly puzzled, and mildly agitated) flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland, referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters, most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic, and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen (Bonham Carter, slightly overdoing it, but arguably the best actor of the bunch) rules the land, but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister, The White Queen (Hathaway doing an air-headed imitation of, you guessed it, Captain Jack Sparrow). Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candy-something that is visually pleasing, but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big Fish. However, this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars, but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought, but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 4/10

Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for.

Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is, unbeknownst to her, on her way to her engagement party. Turns out this is the famous Alice who 13 years earlier ventured in to Wonderland. Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope, she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy. And so, Alice in roped back into the world of fantasy/absurdity.

If you've seen anything at all on this movie, then the strengths are obvious. It's Disney, it's CGI loaded, it's in 3D. Everything visual is well appointed with lavish detail. It makes me wonder if director Tim Burton is better suited as a set designer since he is always given projects for his vision. I recall a time where his vision wasn't hampered by the concepts of others, at time when his films were so wholly original that nothing else compared, and sadly he's been stuck in a limbo of "revisions" for a decade.

For a girl who can't remember anything, Alice is never surprised. She sees giant creatures, she shrinks, flies on a hat, all without a yelp. The first person to blame would be Burton, since Wasikowska lacks leading experience. Still I wonder what's going through her head when she decided to play Alice as oppressively jaded. Outside the last ten minutes, she's the antithesis of Dorothy. Having a protagonist who's so down trodden in a beautiful world is counterintuitive.

Johnny Depp. You pay the man and he'll do his thing. I can't tell you that his character, The Mad Hatter, is an original. I'm sure it's a combination of other Depp figurines. With the Hatter he has carte blanche to do anything, anything at all, and somehow be considered in character. It doesn't matter that he's periodically possessed by a Scotsmanhe's in character and he's Johnny Depp so it must be fantastic, right? More amusing are Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover, the latter of whom you wouldn't recognize.

The White Queen (Anne Hathaway) was in position to be the most complex element of the film. I suppose her role is to assume power in the event that her sister is dethroned. For a character who talks a big game of peace, she sure does mix together an abhorrent potion to return Alice to normal size. Despite repeatedly saying she represents good, I didn't see any evidence. Toes would have been crushed I'm sure, but the vibe from Anne's portrayal suggested that she wanted to be the calculating nemesis.

I can't tell you how stupid this movie made me feel. For some reason it figured a major plot point would be found in determining the identity of Alice. If you are seated in the theatre watching a film called Alice in Wonderland you will not be surprised to find that the lead character of Alice is indeed the very same mentioned in the title. Why we spend most of the film getting to this conclusion feels like an attempt to recreate Hook. 

By the end you realize that Alice is the problem with Wonderland. In the 13 years she's been gone, her friends seem to be in good health despite the Red Queen reigning over the land. Why are they looking for her now? The Red Queen was in power this whole time and they seem to be in good shape, but when Alice gets there the queen challenges them. I suppose she's just as upset to have such a lifeless young girl in her land. I for one am disenchanted.

Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.

There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman  they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind  at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?

I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.

I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace.

Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened  in my theory  when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.

"What if we turn Wonderland into Narnia? What if an older Alice revisits her dream world, now called Underland, and discovers a giant battle in progress between good and evil? We could have a Red Queen's army fighting a White Queen's, a Mad Hatter as saintly mediator, and a lot of Armageddon spectacle sure to bring in the youngsters and spawn a video game."

Thus is Hell born. You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland  gifted director takes on gaga script  until you see it. Enchantment has gone that-away. Once down the rabbit hole Alice, played with brave but doomed grace by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, discovers that her old chums all walk a darkening land bearing Tolkienish/Lewisite names. The dormouse is Mallymkun, the Cheshire cat Chessur, the caterpillar Absolem. Soon the throng is joined by dragons who seem to have come from Avatar. The tea party has 10 seconds to flatter us with incipient charm  its chaotic table and moth-eaten March Hare suggest a Samuel Beckett revamp (that would be a good spin)  before it too is sacrificed to sword, sorcery and showdown. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter shows promise for a little longer  this actor does deranged innocence better than anyone (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood)  but finally he too drowns in the Sea of Tacky Bombast.

Disney presents Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland

STARRING

Johnny Depp... as Willy Wonka, if Willy Wonka hadn't been Michael Jackson

Mia Wasikowska... as a winsome young lady Alice who discovers her inner fortitude

Crispin Glover... who doesn't dance, unfortunately

Helena Bonham-Carter... with a big head

Matt Lucas... as two Matt Lucases

Stephen Fry... who does actual voice acting and doesn't just read his lines

Paul Whitehouse... who against all my expectations, still does know how to be very funny 

Alan Rickman... who nearly steals the movie, just by doing what he does best

Christopher Lee... who actually steals the movie with just two lines

AND

Babs Mitchell-Windsor... playing a character her actual, real size

I can see why the they've not really wanted to call the film a proper sequel. It is that, being the story of a nineteen year old Alice who returns to barely-remembered Wonderland, but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books. The story is your standard journey, emotionally, but all set in a very Tim Burton Wonderland.

Which, of course, looks astounding. Wonderland is an amazing place, often colourful, but equally often ravaged and desolate. It's a treat for the eyes, with the imagination and design shining through the technology. (It's very, very good, but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3D doesn't want you to look and there's the odd moment of strangely stiff animation, especially when human(-like) characters are completely CGI-ed up.)

Unexpectedly, it sometimes feels like one of the Narnia films (though makes those movies look like accountant-led spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain), but mainly it's exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great big treat of a movie, to be sure. Given that it's Tim Burton working with Disney, it's often gruesome and scary, but not too much. It makes you laugh at times, it pins you to the back of your seat at others, it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place, but it's not ever actually surprising. You know what's up, you know where things are going and you're never shocked. (Maybe once, in a quiet, horrible scene that stands out, even amongst the rest.) Even if you've not seen a single still photo or second of footage, if you know Wonderland and you know Tim Burton, you can picture it yourself effortlessly.

So much of it is still in my head this morning, but it's all visual. There's no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story. Funny as it is, there's only one line I'm ever likely to quote (a single word). I just have these amazing images left in my brain. In that sense, then, it's appropriately dream-like.

I doubt I'll go back and watch it again at the cinema, but I'm most definitely getting the Blu- Ray when it comes out next week, or whenever Disney decided they should bring it out.

If it feels like I've damned it with faint praise, I don't intend to. It's all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you, but I just want to make it clear - nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes.

You dolts took a meandering, plot less masterpiece and turned it in all seriousness into a soul-less CGI dirge with the same plot that it's source was LAUGHING AT.

The Jabberwock is not a dragon. The Jabberwock is the IDEA of a dragon. It wears spats and a waistcoat you DOLTS.

The Queen of Hearts never ACTUALLY chops anyone's head off, the Gryphon SAYS SO. There is nothing oppressive or dangerous in Wonderland. Wonderland doesn't make enough SENSE for anything to be dangerous.

Where WAS the Gryphon? Where was the Mock Turtle? Where was Bill the Newt? Where was the trial of the Knave of Hearts? Come to that, where were the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse? The Dormouse is a sleepy fat thing that likes treacle, not Reepicheep.

Where was the Duchess? Where was the Duchess's cook? Why does everybody make such a big deal out of the Cheshire Cat and the Caterpillar? They're among the least significant characters in the book!

Who's this bandersnatch? What's the Jabberwock doing in it at ALL? The Jabberwock's a work of fiction even on the other side of the looking glass!

What's all this faux-sinister creeping about with wounds and murky skies and burning buildings and severed heads? 

You DOLTS. Don't you remember the ending? The oppressive queen, the insulting know-it-all tea-party guests, the bewildering fluctuation in one's own sense of self-importance almost like growing and shrinking, the unhelpful people, the stupid people, the bad-tempered people, yes, and even the hero waving his little magic sword at the scary dragon in a waistcoat and spats, what does Alice say to them? "Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!" Your story-telling has regressed to the shuffling of tropes that children were laughing at over a century ago.

Did you even READ the book?

I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. 

Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. 

1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. 

2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. 

3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.

4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?

EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie.

And yet again Tim Burton's ego gets in the way as it did with Willy Wonka seriously thinking that he can improve an age old classic by replacing what he refers to as a mere series of events a little girl stumbles through, with a trite paint by numbers good versus evil story a la: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Chronicles of Narnia, Golden Compass. He leaves out the magic of the books, the cutting wit, the Topsy turvy absurdity which make the stories so special and a little girl called Alice who's precocious cleverness is way beyond her years. It is not about stifling a director's artistic vision (which every artist has a right to) or reworking of the story but the mere greed and egotistical ambitiousness with which he went after this project, clearly to fatten his pockets. Poor Lewis Carrol is rolling in his grave.

Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice is now 19-years old, and soon after the death of her father, is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured, she runs off, following a white rabbit, which leads her to Wonderland, a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There, she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and eventually the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon, Jabberwocky, as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.

If you remember, Steven Spielberg's Hook was the live action sequel to Peter Pan. Similarly, Tim Burton's film is very much like a close cousin, except it's about Alice. The progression of the story is also kind of similar, where the main character, Alice, like Peter, must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis. Likewise, both films are both elaborately staged, they are both about growing up and making choices, and there's a big showdown. Chances are if one liked Hook, one will find many things to like about Alice.

Tim Burton's version of the Wonderland's environments are gorgeous, imaginatively created, lots of colorful details, and breathes life. The castles are sleek and intricately designed. The creatures are generally live versions (CG) of the Disney's previous animated version, and they're even more odder and fun to look at. I particularly loved the portrayal of the Chesire Cat in this film, and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural, although it wouldn't feel so natural in real life. Only complaint I may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see CG versions of natural creatures like dogs--they're not particularly stylized so their CG-ness can be more noticeable.

Danny Elfman's score fits the environment just right, giving added intensity when needed. This film is essentially Tim Burton's playground and even if there wasn't any story, it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment. I will add that 3-D aspect of it helped a lot.

Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter with usual gusto, as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character. I suppose there is a mix of Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow in there somewhere. Given that other characters are mostly or completely CG, Johnny Depp's character can feel a bit of out of place, as he still feels human. Helena Bonham Carter as the big-headed (literally) Red Queen is fun, expressive, and extremely likable for such a short-tempered character. Mia Wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as Alice, which she plays with free-spirited pluckiness, charm, and beauty.

The story, admittedly, is a simple one, although it is to the story's credit that Alice is now an adult--it helps since many happenings in Wonderland can be quite unfriendly, bizarre, and grotesque. Thankfully, no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child. I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland, like dreams, is an extension of her frustrations with the "real" world, where she felt she had many "expectations" from outside forces. At the same time, it's not like Where the Wild Things Are, where other characters are actually projections of real-life people from the main character's life. For example, to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch, although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future mother-in-law since they both dislike animals. Certainly, one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.

Overall, I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense, that may be the important thing, if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland, I felt, wasn't as poignant as "real life" moments, which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions, it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work, but it's fun, and where it succeeds, it succeeds well, thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals. *** out of **** stars.

Imagine having no hope for something and it still managing to let you down. It began with a pleasant waltz through a fairytale, as depicted in Disney's rendition of the brilliant satire-laden wonderment: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carrol. It has turned into another epic movie, simply seeking to reach into your pockets, and, with what nostalgia is left since your own childhood, throw the last of your hard earned money at an utter failure in script and creativity, at something that looked as though it couldn't possibly fail this hard (with names such as "Tim Burton" and "Johnny Depp". Let us understand a few things here:

-There appears to be no logic process by which the stretching and un-stretching of her attire takes place. It seems that it is simply an idiotic method of plugging fashion.

-The CG characters are the most unmemorable since "9" and have about 0 (zero) effect on the story, other than of course, the cat who decides to ruin the only decent possibility of plot in the entire movie.

-Alice causes the majority of conflict (the scratch on her arm) by denying medical attention from the Cheshire Cat for no apparent reason other than her idiocy.

-The Cheshire Cat ends up being the essential downfall, in my opinion, of the plot, wherein I did indeed sigh loudly and wish that I were anywhere other than in the theater; the cat was used by Burton as a Deus ex Machina in order to save (essentially a plot element that discredits any writer by introducing an exceptionally easy solution to a seemingly impossible problem, with no given expectation that the aforementioned element had such abilities) the character of the Mad Hatter, which is so inconceivably pointless.

-For some reason, this attractive girl seems to show some sort of affection towards the Mad Hatter, and he, in turn does the same, which offers up an awkward feeling as this (elderly? I guess that was what they were inferring by the bags under his eyes) Mad Hatter, with his crooked, altogether oddly shaped eyes, hits on our heroine, the perpetually dumbfounded Alice.

-One more easily predictable movie, no depth whatsoever; seriously, no thought necessary once you enter into the theater. The humor is sub-par: half the audience chuckled about 3 times during the film. I do believe there was more laughing during the preview of "The Karate Kid" than during the actual movie.

-Expect to hear Alice claim that she's in a dream for the majority of the movie, then change her mind until she becomes so confused that smoke literally pours out of her ears.

To sum up what you should know before the movie, this movie is utterly useless. The script is nonsense in a way that defies nonsense. Bland characters, with an all-too-common Johnny Depp running around as though he's just woken up from a hangover and mainlined dope into his eyeball. This is Hollywood pumping movies out that it knows will make a couple of bucks. For the love of whatever invisible man you believe in, do not see it.

Here are a couple of questions to ask yourself after the movie has ended, because maybe, just maybe, you didn't believe how horrendous it could be.

1. WHY does the Mad Hatter slip in and out of a Scottish accent? 2. WHO honestly expected her to become a sailor at the end of this movie? I MEAN WHAT THE ****? REAL GREAT SURPRISE HUH? 3. IF they could change their sizes using this potion, why do the inhabitants not simply make themselves (or Alice) really big and have her just stomp out the Jabberretard? 4. WHY, just WHY does the White Queen have to, at all times, have her hands up in some stupid position? 5. DON'T you wish you had read a review before going?

Far more preferential to myself and several of my peers was the plot of American McGee's Alice, which was a severely macabre twist on the wonderland we once knew; also, the writers of Alice knew that in order to keep someone interested there has to be a storyline that involved a climax, or maybe, hold on to your hats folks, a surprise.

Before getting into any details as to why I left the cinema with confusion and disappointment, I want to start with what I perceive as the best argument why this movie sucks: I saw it at an Sunday afternoon screening, so the cinema was filled with kids at all ages, accompanied by their parents. And during the whole length of the film, I didn't hear a single child laugh or giggle. I didn't laugh myself either, for that matter, but how bad must a children's movie really be if it completely misses its target audience? I mean, it's not like kids have that high standards.

And I would have never believed that I would hold this against a film, but WHY did they feel the urge to suffocate this wonderful piece of fiction under this concrete-like "story" whose pseudo-Christian undertones were lifted straight from the Chronicles of Narnia? Why must sweet little Alice become a soldier and killer for the suppressed inhabitants of Wonderland? Why must every character get a "real" name, every piece of magic (like the "eat me"-cookies) be explained with alchemy, every place get a name and a location that is reachable by just... walking there. Any coherent narrative demands logic - but this logic contradicts everything that Wonderland used to be about.

I have read the source material numerous times (both translated and in its original form), and again and again I was fascinated by its surreal magic, its emphasis on twisted anti-logic (Lewis Carroll aka Charles Dodgson used to be professor for mathematic and a dean in the local church, so he used the books as both an outlet for his more crazy thoughts and to praise the innocence of a child's mind) and its beautifully incorporated themes - like the idea, that the seconds books story unfolds like a game of chess.

But this is "Wonderland: Revolutions", and Alice, now a young woman, must go to war, learn that "Underland" (?) is indeed a real place, and the only way to get home is not to just wake up, but to kill a towering demon, as... it was prophecied, I guess.

Tim Burton didn't seem to have any idea what he wanted to add to the Alice-myth that hadn't been done before, so he constantly shifts back and forth between a nice children's movie in the tradition of the original Disney-movie and a dark, psychological thriller à la "American McGee's Alice", without ever reaching the quality or comitment of either of them.

The only redeeming factor in this CGI-crap is, of course, the acting. Helena Bonham-Carter plays the Red Queen (or better, the Queen of Hearts, the screenwriters screwed that one up, too), and she seems to have the time of her life. She was the only character in the whole flick that made me smile, once or twice. Both Crispin Clover and Mia Wasikowska play their parts decent and nuanced enough, considering what's going on around them. Especially newcomer Wasikowska plays the confusion and hidden inner strength of her character quiet niece and subtle, and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a really good movie. Anne Hathaways White Queen was also noteworthy for her fragility and confined madness.

But, yeah, this is, after all, a Johnny Depp-flick, and I guess he had it coming to damage his exceptional career by blindly trusting into Disneys Paychecks and Burtons.... whatever it is these two guys have in common. It's unbelievable! Here we have the same guy who played ingeniously Hunter S. Thompson and Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka; he plays the quintessential MAD figure of western culture... yet he is easily out-acted by a CGI-cat. A few years back, the computer animated tears in The Lord of the Rings urged me to make some cynical remarks about the future of acting - but here we have an actor's whole performance depending on the photo-shopping done to his eyes. And, well, a wardrobe and make-up which even Ziggy Stardust wouldn't have worn in his weirdest times.

So, to sum it up: Its a shame watching this material and those actors going to waste for the sake of a "narrative" that no one would have missed. It fails as "dark" fantasy film, and, what's worse, it fails as a children's story.

The most depressing thought I had after leaving the cinema was: How many parents must have felt relieved that they never read this "crap" to their children? 

Now I know how it must have felt to be a Transformers-fan.

What a over-rated, self-indulgent movie. Right from the inclusion of Johnny Deep in a maddening avatar to Helena Carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head, Tim Burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony, in a bad way.

Mia Wasikowska stars or rather pales as Alice, devoid of emotion or interest. Her pale, frail look gets on one's nerves as she sleepwalks throughout the film, with an expressionless countenance that feels weakens the movie significantly. The scenes where she is supposed to be brave look rehearsed and forced. In fact, I and my friends got so bugged that we wanted her clothes to fall off so that she could create some stir in the audience!

Anne Hathaway, vibrant and exquisite in Rachel Getting Married, gives a superficial portrayal of the kind and loving White Queen. Poor soul is soulless in the movie as she tries hard to be Meryl Streep or Julie Andrews but falters. Why did Tim have to cast her for a role more suitable for an older actress? Though miscast, she at least tries to make a character of her own, unlike Mia, but looks robotic. In fact, she looked like a typical deceiving hag who would bear her fangs anytime. "Oh, she's wearing white! Symbolizes peace. She must be the good one" but unfortunately, she ends up getting wasted. And even though her performance is being berated by a number of viewers, I feel that she at least tries to get into her role. Wish she didn't look so hideous here!

Mad Hatter is played by the outlandish Johnny Depp but he too doesn't cast much impact in his half-baked role. None of the characters, including him, connects with the audience. None are very likable. I remember, in Chronicles of Narnia, where though the main four Britishers aren't versatile actors, but the supporting cast shines. Tilda Swinton was towering, tormenting and impactful. Aslan, though not a real character, still was very likable. Here, everyone is mundane and lifeless. Depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isn't groundbreaking or any of that sort. And I'm not a hater of Johnny or Tim Burton (loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, liked Timm's Batman, Johnny's What's eating Gilbert Grape?)

Helena plays the Red Queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous. She plays the role differently though, not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute. Instead, she plays a role similar to Meryl Streep's in She-Devil, who gives herself too much airs. She is funny and redeeming for a while. Then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance one-dimensional.

Crispin Grover is tolerable. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are neither funny nor likable, overbearing at times. The story is tedious and the animation prosaic. The real world characters are so full of themselves and don't supply anything to the movie. The final scene is a bit implausible and rushed. 

Well, it was a long, long, unending journey in the theater for me. Certainly a huge disaster from a talented guy. 1 out of 10 stars and a thumbs down.

The Good: It did not give me cancer.

The Bad: Alice in Wonderland is a treasure of classic literature, and classic Disney. Well it was. That all changed with the latest abortion by Tim Burton. AIW was easily, the lamest, contrived, nonsensical piece of crap that has ever made me want to gouge my eyes out whilst watching it. And I use the above terms of nonsensical and lame, in the most disrespectful ways possible. 

Gone was the innocence, whimsy, curiosity, and dare I say magic, of the novel and the Disney animated classic. In its place, a wooden, funny looking actress whose range of emotions went from "oh, a fly just landed on my plate" to "oh, a dog. and it's brown." Those last two situations didn't actually occur, however, they may have been more interesting than what had.

I am literally shocked. How one could take a piece of literature (and film, in numerous outings) and turn it to "that", is beyond my level of comprehension. This proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that Tim Burton can no longer be regarded as a genius, or even a competent storyteller. He has become a quirky nightmare with a lot of money and fantastic art director. To boot, Johnny Depp has become an unwatchable characterization of himself, a bad parody, that seriously needs to stop, and much like the director, needs to get back the formula of Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. 

I'm blown away by how poor this film was. I went in with zero expectations, and it surpassed them in a negative sense. In a rating of 1 to 10, I give this film a burial at sea, so no one can urinate on it any more than Tim Burton already has. Oh, and Avril Lavine does the end music. She is to art what small pox is to life. 

Let me add, I get it. It was supposed to be a follow up, or sequel, or something along those lines. Something of an homage piece if you will. This was not executed. In the least. The dialog was barely audible and both mixed and pronounced to the poorest degree. The plot was quick, the inside jokes quicker and hackney, the plot spoon fed and completely forced. This film disgusts me. It's everything wrong with modern Hollywood cinema directed at a younger generation, and even to my own. Once again, a treasured tale from youth and fond cinematic memory now has an blemish, thanks to this. Tim Burton needs to stop adapting loved literature. Like, now. 

The Ugly: I sort of wish it gave me cancer so if (and when) they do make a (gasp)sequel, I'd be dead long before the trailer came out. Or would at least have bigger problems on my hands.

I loved "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand "Alice" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'.

When I first heard that Tim Burton was making Alice in Wonderland, and when, later yet, I saw the stills and first promotional shots, I could not wait to see it. I decided to forget all about how disappointing Burton's latest movies were, and thought to myself, we'll probably all fall in love with him again.

So when the first reviews turned out to be less than favourable, I was surprised. When some of then were outright terrible, I started suspecting that maybe my expectations had been too high. But nothing, NOTHING prepared me for yesterday's bitter disappointment.

First, the positive. Nice costumes, and I mean REALLY, seriously nice costumes. Dresses to die for, and hats to wear in a dream. And the Cheshire cat who is so fluffy that you are seriously tempted to reach out and ruffle his tummy. And the Red Queen, who is the only believable character with acting worth the mention. And... oh wait, the list ends here.

If Burton had spent as much time writing the story, developing the characters and working on the dialogue, as he had on making sure that the dresses were spectacular, this movie might have been quite alright. But instead, he opted to provide a story so predictable and unimaginative, you have to wonder why it was put to screen at all. And he seemed to have thought that, if the story (or lack of it, to be honest) was not dreadfully bad enough, this could be fixed by carefully adding a cliché to almost every line in the dialogue, and by making sure that there was not a single funny (like laugh-out-loud funny, not a half-smile-OK funny) moment in the whole movie.

Worst of all, he mercilessly murdered the essence and soul of the characters. Alice is lifeless, boring and mechanical. The Hatter has a few brilliant moments and he was graciously allowed a few acceptable lines by Burton, but mostly it is all been-there-done-that another over-the-top-facial-paint-role for Depp. The movie leaves one thankful for the Red Queen  her character would not impress you in any better movie, where she would simply be a decently amusing villain, but here it's only her presence that can lighten up the screen somewhat. Hathaway's beauty is worth admiring, but the White Queen would be better left in a poster, as the moment she starts speaking or moving, it is so unnatural, word "cringy" does not do it justice. The others are not even worth the mention, with the exception of the Caterpillar, where Rickman's charisma cannot be so subdued that it would not shine through.

At many points in this movie I tried to tell myself  this is a movie for children, what do you expect. Well, much more. There are many wonderful children's movies that are delightful to watch for audiences of all ages. This leaves you a feeling you just spent 2 hours watching the Mardi Gras carnival at 4 am, where beautiful clad dancers barely even move anymore, their steps mechanical and their eyes glazed over, and the audience too drunk to care.

I went with a friend who said she loved it, as it looked nice. If this is all you are looking for, and if you watch it while playing your favourite album on your MP3 player so as to limit your experience to moving images, you might just find it enjoyable enough.

This is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a few years. Alice in Wonderland should have been something up Tim Burton's alley, and instead he turned it into something it wasn't. He should have taken over the screenplay from Linda Woolverton (whoever that is) and created darker, more dimensional characters; instead, what we get is Tim Burton for kids. I would have preferred his take on Lewis Carroll's novel rather than a rehash of every Hollywood fantasy film. I thought the younger Alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role. Depp ruined the Mad Hatter with his accent and incoherent speech, Burton ruined the Mad Hatter with his ugly costume design. I was disappointed to not hear Hatter shout "Change places!" I understand he is saddened by resent events, but even a mumbled, sad, "Change places" would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effort.

The charm behind Carroll's novel is that there really isn't much of a story, but rather a series of random and always bizarre events that are colorful and imaginative. You start to gain the sense that Alice really is in a peculiar land and at times you even often pity her. With her return to Wonderland the life behind everything the novel created almost evaporated. I say almost because the Cheshire Cat steals the show and truly did save the the film. Regardless, I would have much preferred a stop-motion attempt (The Nightmare Before Christmas) from Tim Burton rather than the use of actors and actresses to portray Carroll's characters. What we're left with because of this is unnecessary, though beautiful, CGI and a lot of it. At the very least the mood atmosphere of Edward Scissorhands would have been a delightful treat.

I was oh so very excited to see Alice in Wonderland. It was my one of my favorite movies growing up. I even went to the theater in my AiW paraphernalia. I like Tim Burton and I like Disney, do I honestly thought that nothing could go wrong. It did.

1. I couldn't find the plot. 2. Most of the acting, especially "Alice's" was absolutely horrible. However, the Red Queen and whoever voiced the Cheshire Cat both did decent jobs. 3. The entire thing was animated. Don't get me wrong, I love animation, but you should at least match the characters to their environment (like Avatar did) instead of making it look like a sloppy cut and paste job. 4. I guessed how the movie was going to play out before "Alice" even got to Wonder-- oh, I mean, UNDERland. 5. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen and... NOTHING DID. There wasn't an obvious moral or message (or at least not a very good one) and there was no reason for her to return to her own world. And the thought of her "discussing business" at the end? No. Just no.

I can't think of a clearer way to say this: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT. 

This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.

The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.

Music sounds like a bunch of sampled "ooouuuooo" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.

There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final "DANCE" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.

Even on a "woman becoming a powerful individual" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.

Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in. Join the feast.

Over 100 years ago, a man by the name of Charles Dodgson wrote a strange little story about a little girl that falls down a rabbit hole and ends up in a magical world with rabbits in waistcoats, Hatters, cats that vanish, March Hares, and playing cards that talk. The story was Alice in Wonderland, and Charles Dodgson is best known by another name-Lewis Carroll. 

In 100+ years the tale has continued to enchant and delight children of all ages. Every generation has fallen down the rabbit hole, and the story has been told in every medium. The most common way to tell the story has been through film, and over the years there have been some hits(the 1951 film) and some misses(the 1985 TV movie). This movie is a definite hit. 

A word of caution at the start-this is not Carroll's story. If you are going in expecting a pure adaptation, you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for marvelous visuals, excellent acting, wonderful music, and a movie that will indulge your senses, then this is the film for you. The best bits- 1. The acting. In my opinion, Depp is a marvelous actor. He has proved himself time and again, and no role he plays is the same. This role was no different. His Hatter had a depth and scope of character that was downplayed a bit in the trailers. In that, you only saw the 'upbeat' Hatter. But he has a darker side as well, and madness-of the darkest sort-is never far from the surface. He is one of the best characters in the movie. However, the prize for most astonishing debut has to go to Mia Wasikowska as Alice. She is phenomenal. Her journey from a timid, if somewhat unorthodox, girl into a brave and courageous young woman is wonderful and believable. Special note must also be made of Helena, Anne and Crispin, who did just marvelous in their roles. Crispin especially-he's so deliciously slimy. And, of course, all the voice actors suited their roles perfectly. The Cheshire Cat was by far the best, though-with the March Hare behind by a whisker. 

2. The Visuals-Gorgeous. That's really all I can say. I saw this in 3D, and was not disappointed. It was a truly marvelous experience. 

3. The Plot-It is a bit rushed, but I think it worked fine for this movie. I would have liked a bit more time to explore the characters, but all in all it kept me interested, and it was enjoyable. 

And as much as it might shock people, I thought the Futterwacken was actually kind of neat, and did not take me out of the movie at all. 

To conclude, this movie was-to borrow a Carrollism- Frabjous.

Oh...the irony of it. As probably many know, Tim Burton started as an employee of Disney. But his work was considered too frightening and surreal, and soon he was fired. Now this movie marked his return. This alone should tell the story. Face it, we never liked Tim Burton for his amazing skill to write dialogues, for the deep characters he create because (not counting Edward Scissorhand) there were none. We liked him because he was a big kid, with a fascinating, dark, twisted imagination. He had style and creativity. Now the kid is all grown up and became a money-hungry prostitute. Sad and harsh. But true. Sweeney Todd was the first sign and this....this piece of... 

By the way i really had enough of Disney too, they "evolved" completely into a regrettable monstrosity. Poor Lewis Carroll. And poor other artists you ripped off to make ridicoulus amount of money lately. You really have no shame left? When it comes to nowadays Disney i always imagine a scene from an average high-school movie. You know where the strong and dumb jock terrorises the nerd and when the nerd asks why, he says: because i can, you cant stop me. Yes congratulation Disney, a dead artist really cant stop you from completely destroying, ruining, nullifying his work. You really have no shame left? Sadly the answer is pretty clear. 

The only decent scene was the one with the execution. The other were only eye-candy without any hint of meaning or depth. Oh and congratulation for one more thing, you even managed to completely ruin even the ending credits with that ear-raping dumb teenage-pop-rock whatever piece of trash song too. Its not everyday when a bitter and sour cake is topped so nicely with such a disgusting topping, you really done something extraordenary, but at least it was fitting. Tim Burton will never read this sadly, but for what it worth, i admired his work, now i officially turn my back on everything he creates and let the little goths drool about it, they are still young they might grow out of it someday too.

My primary reason for seeing this movie was because it was another Bonham Carter-Depp-Burton collaboration. I was timid to pay the 3D price after remembering Burton's attempt at "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (I wasn't a big fan of the movie, like many other critics), but this was well worth the price tag.

I agree with many of the other reviews available online. The visual experience is breathtaking and when this movie is released, it will be well worth the Blu-ray price. However, I disagree with reviews stating the movie had no "plot" or "substance" or was "too confusing." (For those of you who haven't seen it, be sure to pay attention to the beginning of the movie--everything that happens ties in with Alice's Wonderland experience.) Perhaps this is where people have become disappointed: you can't watch this movie thinking it's just like the book or a remake/live-version of the Disney animated film that was produced nearly 60 years ago. You have to approach the movie for what it is--Burton taking familiar characters, a familiar setting and plot, then expanding on it with his own take (once again with the help of best friend Johnny Depp and long-time significant other Helena Bonham Carter); using superb animation technology and phenomenal costume design--I expect to see various "Alice"s this Halloween.

I give this a 9/10... because, no film is perfect.

Having never read the book/s, and only having vague memories of the old Disney cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland, all I knew going into this film was the gist of what the story was about. However different things may be this time around, though, it still remains an interesting tale. Alice isn't as young as the first time she visited Wonderland (she's 19 now) and has forgotten her previous journey, but it seems she goes about doing things exactly the same way as she did her first time around (like drinking/eating stuff that says 'Drink Me'/'Eat Me' - Considering just how ominous that sounds, WHY would you do that??). Her various "wardrobe malfunctions"/costume changes, as a result of her shrinking/growing, are fun to watch.

Aussie actress Mia Wasikowska, despite what some might say, is actually very well cast in the role of the now older Alice. I can see why Tim Burton picked this relative newcomer over more well-known actresses. Despite all the amazing visuals/weird and wonderful characters in Wonderland, Mia is what carries this film. And a grand job she does of it too. She doesn't come off as annoying or stupid, but a character who's trying to figure out who she is and not wanting to let others decide *for* her. She certainly holds her own with rest of the cast and proves to in fact be the "right Alice". Alice definitely has not lost her "muchness".

Johnny Depp is actually quite restrained as the Mad Hatter...in a manner of speaking. He never goes so over the top that you can't connect with the character. He does, in fact, give the Hatter much more gravity and depth than you might expect from such a loon. His interaction/friendship with Alice helps ground the film (they're very loyal to each other). While he does have his wacky moments, he also has some quieter moments where you really get to see into the heart of his character. Speaking of hearts...

Helena Bonham Carter is a riot as the Red Queen/Queen of Hearts. She's completely off her rocker, as you'd expect, what with that bulbous head of hers. Watching her face turn red (as she gets all sorts of mad at everyone and everything), resting her feet on pigs and playing croquet with flamingos is really quite amusing. Her taking a liking to "Um from Umbridge" (as Alice refers to herself as) allowed for some great interaction between the two. Then, of course, the Queen lets loose with the "OFF WITH HER HEAD!!!" screaming once she finds out what is what. Meanwhile, the always creepy Crispin Glover - as Stayne/the Knave of Hearts - is one twisted individual (he likes "largeness"?). Of course, by the end of the film, we discover he might not be as devoted to his Queen as first thought (which totally blows the mind of the Red Queen's already swollen head).

Then there's the White Queen, played to perfection by Anne Hathaway. She totally embodies the role of this graceful, peace-loving, slightly peculiar, extremely pale Queen, who seemingly glides everywhere and is so majestic in all of her movements. Even Ms. Hathaway's *voice* is different to what we're used to. She's a bit odd, but that's what makes her so wonderful - that and the faces she makes when something grosses her out (which is especially funny, given the potions she creates - involving ingredients such as urine, fingers and her own spittle).

As for the voice cast, I really enjoyed Stephen Fry as the grinning/cheeky Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen (who's been a werewolf, a vampire and is now a fluffy bunny) as the White Rabbit and Timothy Spall as the bloodhound, Bayard. As the March Hare, I couldn't understand much of what Paul Whitehouse was saying, but he was nevertheless entertaining (as he truly came off as mad - even moreso than the Hatter). The one character I couldn't stand was that stupid Dormouse! How I hated her, with her constant declarations of "She's the wrong Alice!". I was so glad when Alice just TOOK the eyeball of the Bandersnatch from that annoying Dormouse when she dared her to. By the way, I really liked that spotted creature and how it and Alice were a team/friends by the end.

As far as story goes, this was an interesting interpretation (in that it's a sequel of sorts to the original Alice tale). I never felt things got "boring" at any stage, and while it did come close to running a tad too long, I feel it ended at just the right moment and with a nice conclusion for the character of Alice. This was the first/only movie that I have seen in 3D, and what a great experience it was! Things literally flying out at you/feeling like you could reach out and touch them/like they were there in the cinema *with* you? Truly splendid. It was visually stunning (as was the beginning of the end credits). Tim Burton has given us a superb interpretation of the story that puts almost all other screen adaptations to shame. I'd definitely be willing to go down the rabbit hole and see it all again.
