### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I saw this Premiere at Sundance 2015. This is what a Sundance film should be. You start watching at a distance. The subject matter of prostitutes, pimps, drugs, sex, homosexuality and gender roles is foreign to most and even repulsive to some. But that's the beauty. It draws you in...you start to care about the characters, you start to laugh with them. You then admire their pluck. You feel their frustration, sadness and even shame. Then you identify with it. Then, eventually, you admire it. Finally, what you see are human beings with the same, or even better, values that you have. The music is cutting edge street sound that propels you along the LA sidewalks and, combined with the colors of the film (i.e. tangerine), it pulls you into the brash and jolting life on some of the worse streets of LA. The power of the film is that, in powerful ways, that street community seems a better home than you have in safe suburbia. This is what indie film should be.....it takes a different subject matter, perhaps something disturbing, draws you in and changes the way you view the world. Forever. Not just during the course of a film festival.

Even better, this film was shot entirely on three iPhone 5s. At the Premiere, the audience audibly gasped when this fact rolled on screen during the credits. Another thing an indie film should do...change the way you look at how films can be made. (I'm actually going to try to make a film this summer...seriously).

This film should have won the Sundance NEXT award....and probably would have if it was not by audience vote. This is not mainstream..it is an independent film. This film will change your life.

P.S. Both female leads were powerful and legitimate, in every sense of that word. But Kiki Kitana Rodriguez has screen presence and karma enough to fill Dodger Stadium one hundred times over. I could watch her for yours, and hope we all have a chance to do so again.

Right up front let me tell you this is not an easy film to watch. It is vulgar, raw, painful and shocking at times. It is, however, going to stand for some time as this generation's example of how to write a story, tell a story, and create characters that are not only believable, but memorable. Tangerine, the gift we get on Christmas in America, is a story about people who live in constant chaos, in an unsafe and harsh America where not everyone get's sterling silver from the man in the North pole. It is a visually stunning achievement and reminds us that those of us who make art are first and foremost storytellers. Bravo to those who were brave enough to produce, act in and make this story come to our movie screens. Watch out Hollywood, the next generation of artists making movies has arrived.

Greetings again from the darkness. It's hard to imagine a better choice for opening night of the 4th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival. After all, this year's theme is the "No Wave Movement" of the late 1970's, and writer/director Sean Baker's most recent film (and a Sundance favorite) is the perfect complement. Co-written with Chris Bergoch and filmed entirely on iPhone 5s' (with cinematic apps), this gritty, no-frills film spotlights real problems of real people on a real day  on the real streets of Hollywood and Los Angeles.

Personally, I haven't seen many (ok, any) films that focus on two transgender prostitutes (both, persons of color). However, the exciting thing is that the story pays little attention to the vocation of Sin-Dee and Alexandra, and is more a story of friendship, heartbreak, and the sub-cultures that make up a particular community of the L.A. area. This is not the glitzy/celebrity side of Hollywood, but rather the underbelly of a melting pot city where the paths of transgender streetwalkers and Armenian cab drivers intersect.

Sin-Dee (Kiki Kitana Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor) are opposite personality types, but clearly good friends as they chat while splitting a donut in the opening scene. We quickly learn that Sin-Dee is fresh out of jail after serving 28 days, and she doesn't react well to Alexandra's news that their pimp (and Sin-Dee's boyfriend) Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating with a "natural" woman (played by a very talented Mickey O'Hagan) while she was incarcerated. A woman scorned provides the energy of the film as Sin-Dee tracks down this mysterious girl whose name starts with a "D". It also provides new meaning for dragging someone all over town (kudos to Ms O'Hagan for the physicality and bruises).

The sassy banter is filled with brutal put-downs and smart-ass comebacks, as the three actresses play off each other as if loaded with short-fused fireworks. The story with taxi driver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) shows a family man drawn like a magnet to the world of Sin-Dee and Alexandra  he even finds a reason to skip out on Christmas Eve dinner with his family. His mother-in-law Ashken (Alla Tumanian) is most suspicious of his activities, and that leads to the frenetic and hilarious confrontation at Donut Time.

Many individual scenes are funny, while others are tension-filled. There is even a scene in Razmik's cab featuring veteran actor Clu Gulager ("The Virginian"), and Armenian celebrity Arsen Grigoryan plays another taxi driver. The acting throughout is strong and humanistic, and the iPhone photography is shocking in its depth and range  we would never suspect the "equipment" being used. This approach allowed for the organic feel of the street  think of Banksy making a movie  clandestine with no sets (or permits). Baker's style is reminiscent of John Waters and John Cassavetes, and that's quite a compliment. The film also features the pitch perfect description of Los Angeles: "a beautifully wrapped lie".

Glad to see the theater packed for this one. The way it was shot feels like a documentary, but the raw subject matter and unpolished acting were in-your-face in the best ways. There's no time to judge these fast-moving, trans-gendered prostitutes, and why would you? Everything's f***ed up. Family people are not what they seem, everyone's motivations are unique, people are desperate for acceptance, affection and enough money to make it to the next day. They play the hands they're dealt, like all of us, spinning around and around, trying to get answers and making stupid mistakes along the way. In the end, it's still a friendship movie, not a package with a shiny, redeeming bow. Sick of safe, sanitized, statistical NPR? Here's your movie.

Aside from being a thoroughly enjoyable film, "Tangerine" has the remarkable distinction of being shot entirely on an iPhone 5S. How such a feat was accomplished is beyond me for while it does appear to be a low budget piece it looks fantastic. Furthermore, maybe because of the unique film techniques, it feels very real, like you were just tagging along for the duration.

The story takes place over the course of about 12 hours, following the lives of two transgender prostitutes on Christmas Eve. Sin-dee has just been released from jail, and her best friend Alexandra lets slip that her boyfriend/pimp picked up with another women while she was away. This sets Sin-dee off on a rampage as she scours the L.A. streets looking for the new girl and her cheating man. The story weaves from Sin-dee's quest, to Alexandra picking up a few tricks throughout the day, and subtly follows a cab driver who has a thing for Sin-dee, while his family works out his proclivities. Through all of this, the film is not condescending, preachy, or insensitive to anyone. It is brutally honest, hilarious at times, realistic, even touching and sad.

I loved this movie. From the colorful characters to the perfect pacing to the creative cinematography, "Tangerine" is one film every lover of cinema should watch at least once. Oh, and a super soundtrack! I hope to add it to the collection one day.

A fabulous character study, gritty slice of life, walk on the wild side comedy . . . any variety of possible descriptions come to mind.

But no matter how one tries to frame this uniquely crafted work, despite its very low production budget (this entire movie was filmed with iPhones?), it's still surprisingly entertaining.

I could try to encapsulate the drama (and yes, drama, as in on the street, way over the edge drama) between the two main characters, and the meandering ill fated adventures that sprout up along the way, but actually, better that you simply watch and experience for yourself.

No spoilers, not even a hint . . . but what I will suggest here, the time spent to watch this will not be wasted.

Kudos to a very clever bit of street drama compressed into a simple but engaging journey into and through a collection of lives that are all too real out in certain sections of town, which in this case happens to be West Hollywood.

Not sure if this was really worth my time to watch. Very long and at times extremely boring - you're trying so hard to stay focused and keep your attention to see how the story progresses, when really there is barely a story. Spoiler Alert: A transgender hooker gets out of jail and goes looking for her boyfriend/pimp daddy after hearing that he may have been cheating on her with a 'fish' (a supposedly derogatory term for woman). 

I don't know what is more frustrating, the horrible acting or the cheap script (some lines are meant to sound 'hood' or 'street' yet sound so cringe-worthy). The constant need to remind the audience that the protagonist (Sin-Dee) is so much 'drama'...that's exactly what this movie was, unnecessary and petty drama that leaves you alienated and not wanting to commit any time towards the story. Is this suppose to be a good representation for the transgender community? Emotions are not portrayed as genuine or authentic. It seems so cheap and shallow, lacking in any character depth. 

Basically I would never recommend this movie. It leaves you feeling depressed over the way these people run their lives, yet you lack the connection to support or feel sympathetic to their problems. It's just a big loud mess of nonsense. The 2 stars I give is for Mya Taylor who seems to be the only competent actor in the whole film.

My friend put me on to this, with no mention at all of what it was about... so totally unexpected. What I really liked about Tangerine is that it didn't pull its punches. None of the main characters are 100% hero or villain... everyone is sad/funny/cruel/kind at some point. I can't say I'd want to hang out with ANYONE in this movie... but they're all presented as complex characters, people, which is great.

I can see why John Waters liked it, it does remind me a bit of his earlier films with their various crazed characters in crazed worlds... though Tangerine feels much more real and gritty than any of those Waters films, which were heavy with fantasy.

Anyway, it's excellent... I hope it garners a huge following and we start getting more films like this and less superhero trash.

This whole thing looks like someone thought "I should make a movie with an iPhone but I don't know what about". And then did exactly that. 

While the visuals of the movie look surprisingly decent, then again, digital cameras evolved a lot in the past few years, so it's actually not that odd. These days a good performing smart phone, like iPhone or Android, can do a really good job for a filmmaker on a budget. And let's not kid ourselves here - many indie filmmakers of the days old, early '00s, '90s and before, would kill to have a hand-held devices like these that can do so much with so little money. That just proves that nowadays you pretty much need only an idea and some will (and around 500$ for a phone). 

While the will is certainly there, idea, not so much. Yes, the premise is simple and sounds fun but in reality it's really, really drawn out and boring. There's a lot of furious walking and crappy music blasting over that, and while that can be a cool schtick in a fast paced movie, here it just becomes a bore after first few times. 

Characters are non existent in terms of actual characterization, just like in real life :P But there are some good performances and those are done mostly by Mya Taylor that also has maybe the most fleshed out character in here.

One thing that kinda bothered me after watching this is that the movie is hailed like godsend. Not only because it was shot with an iPhone, but because it also had trans leading cast. While that's great, at the end I kinda thought about it a bit and it struck me that maybe the director basically did this: "Cool, I have two trans people, of color nonetheless, as leads, what shall I do with them? What kind of story will I build around them to better the status of trans and black people? Yes, I'll make them dumb, junkie prostitutes and bad people.". 

But I honestly don't know and can't even remotely claim that as fact. Maybe he had it around, created this weak story and then just cast them. Maybe he didn't care about that at all and just wanted to create a real, boring, junkie pimps and hoes drama evening in the LA shot with an iPhone. I'm not from LA, or USA but I guess this is like every evening in LA, judging by this and other movies (primarily Death Wish 2!).

If this was half it's length, I would recommend it, just for the gimmick/proof of concept (whatever rocks you boat) of using iPhone and having trans leads, because if one place need some diversity, it's mainstream movies these days. But it's almost hour an a half long and it got me bored pretty fast. So, it's your time, do with it what you want. In the end, our end to be exact, as viewers, Tangerine looks like a movie, no matter what's used to shoot it, and with people doing some boring, very mildly entertaining stuff.

'TANGERINE': Four Stars (Out of Five)

Critically acclaimed indie flick; about a transgender prostitute, searching for her boyfriend (a pimp who cheated on her), in Hollywood, on Christmas Eve. The movie was directed by Sean S. Baker, and written by Baker and Chris Bergoch. It stars Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, Karren Karagulian, Mickey O'Hagan and James Ransone. The film was made on a budget of just $100,000; and it was shot (entirely) on three iPhone 5s smartphones! It's definitely a well made, and very memorable, movie. 

The story takes place on Christmas Eve, 2014; in Hollywood. Sin-Dee Rella (Rodriguez), a transgender sex worker, just got out of prison; after serving a 28-day sentence. She meets another transgender prostitute, her friend Alexandra (Taylor), at a donut shop. Alexandra (accidentally) informs Sin-Dee, that her boyfriend, a pimp named Chester (Ransone), cheated on her; while she was in prison. Sin-Dee goes ballistic, and spends the rest of the day, looking for him; and his new mistress (O'Hagan). 

Despite being filmed on iPhones, the movie is surprisingly beautiful at times; especially in it's most poignant, and very subtle, moments! It's dirty, and very disgusting, a lot of the time too; but it's also very moving. The two lead performances are impressive, and they're performed by openly transgender actresses (too); and the supporting cast is all good as well. The movie definitely seems like you're watching real people, doing real things; in a part of life, I'm not familiar with (which makes it all the more fascinating). It's an impressive little film!

Covering a day in the lives of two trans sex workers, Tangerine is an offbeat surprise that's hilarious, heartwarming & heartbreaking, is bursting with energy & style from start to finish, and offers an unusual glimpse into Los Angeles' sex-trade subculture. As unconventional in content as it is in the way it's shot, this is one comedy that defies everything in its path.

The story of Tangerine unfolds on Christmas Eve and follows two trans sex workers who are also best friends. One of them is Alexandra who's inviting friends all over the town to attend the gig she has secured for the night. The other is Sin-Dee Rella who just tears through the town to find her pimp boyfriend after learning that he cheated on her while she was locked up.

Written & directed by Sean S. Baker, Tangerine is crafted with rigour & passion and shatters many filmmaking norms over the course of its runtime. Filmed entirely on iPhone with more enhancements coming from easily available apps, the film gleams with colour filters & warm palette that gives it a distinctive look. And although the first act requires some getting used to, it only gets funnier as the plot progresses.

While the primary focus is on Sin-Dee & Alexandra, the subplots related to other characters connected to these two are also interesting in their own ways. The film also breaks tradition in the casting department by employing two transgender actresses in the given roles & both of them deliver fantastic performances, with Mya Taylor playing her character in a balanced manner while Kitana Kiki Rodrigues going full crazy as Sin-Dee.

On an overall scale, Tangerine is an inventive, distinctive & hysterical piece of indie cinema that allows its audience to settle down in the first act after which it instantly changes gears, gets more wild & vibrant with every passing minute, goes absolutely bonkers in its final act when all its different threads combine together to form a single whole, and finally concludes with a touching ode to friendship. In a sentence, Tangerine works because its heart is at the right place. Definitely worth a shot.

Tangerine is a real limited budget movie that can knock the blocks out from under the big bloated, big budget, big star movies. So often the big budget movies have just that only, a big budget, fancy sets, bored actors, a rambling plot line and nothing else. A little budget movie comes along and offers so much more - like talent, imagination, and believable character portrayals. Tangerine succeeds in all of these!

If you want to read a great review of this film read 'maurice yacowar' review here with the others. His review is brilliant! I just want to mention the Christmas message Director: Sean Baker gives us at movies end. The spirit of giving when you have nothing!

Throughout the movie we see the main characters, Sin-Dee & Alexandra's, friendship being put to the test by Sin-Dee's behavior. At the end Sin-Dee is publicly humiliated and soiled by what appears to be a group of suburban privileged males. Alexandra has been rejected by Sin-Dee at this point but Alexandra comes to the aid of Sin-Dee and helps clean her up in a Laundromat. And to make Sin-Dee feel better about herself Alexandra takes off her clean wig and gives it to Sin-Dee because her friendship with Sin-Dee is more important than any disagreement between them.

It is Christmas Eve in L.A. and Alexandra and Sin-Dee have lived the the message of giving and acceptance that comes with Christmas!

Apart from a pretty decent and modern soundtrack, there is very little to like about this film. The film has a plot and content that would make any Sundance film-festival fan drool at how "edgy" and "raw" it is. It's got hookers, drugs, and Hollywood sleaze (because who knew that Hollywood could be so decadent?). The characters are neither funny nor interesting. They are, however, played by quite talented actors who are actually themselves trans-gender. I'am so totally bemused as to why this film is so well acclaimed. If it is only acclaimed because of having play trans-gender people play trans-gender people and for some reason that makes the film automatically good, then I must say, the bar is being set considerably low.

This delightful odd-ball dramedy is another interesting film made around the edges of mainstream society from Sean Baker, who also made the excellent, clever 'Starlet', about a very likable, druggy, porn actress. 

This film is about two transsexual prostitutes who are best friends, and their series of misadventures as they try to track down Sin-Dee's boyfriend/pimp. He has broken her heart by reportedly fooling around with a non-transsexual woman while Sin-Dee was in prison for a month on a drug rap. 

Shot on an iPhone, and bursting with energy, playfulness, sexuality, and just the right amount of sadness and reality, it's surprising how much fun, and how often funny the film is, while still allowing these 'outsider' characters dignity and heart. 

It sometimes feels a bit episodic and repetitive, and a couple of bits are humor are forced. Also, for the most part these are not actors, and while that raw, unprofessional quality can nicely add to the sense of truth, it can also occasionally hurt the comic timing, or take away from the emotion of a scene. 

But overall, this is a terrifically original American indie, made from the heart, and on far less than a shoestring, It gives voice and humor to leading characters who at best would be a throw away one line joke in most Hollywood films. (It also looks pretty damn good for a film shot on a phone!). Well worth seeing.

...should have been the title for this film. I'm not a big fan of 'scripted reality' shows and this is basically an SR show made into a feature length film with a few added gimmicks thrown in to get attention.

The film starts abruptly enough, and at this point I was thinking 'ok well judging by the reviews the film obviously has great characterisation or something' but no it just becomes a mess of bitching, swearing, walking about, "cool" music interludes and the protagonists being generally unpleasant to anyone and everyone they meet.

Throw in the fact it's all shot on iPhone - which conveniently excuses the cast for their atrocious acting - and let's not forget the hype generated by the transgender / transsexual angle - and you've got a film which isn't going away in a hurry.

It's great to see trans women - in fact anyone from an LGBT subgroup for that matter - represented on-screen by people from that actual community - but just imagine how much better it would be if they tried to actually act!

I like the fact this film gives a voice and some screen time to otherwise marginalised actors and actresses - but it's done so amateurishly it's impossible to feel anything for any of the characters because they are depicted as either unlikable or just unrealistic human beings. You'll find yourself asking how some of these people made it to adulthood if this is the way they treat each other. Where's the love?

As for this being a Christmas movie, if they didn't feel the need to remind the viewer that 'it's xmas eve!' every 6 mins you would be forgiven for assuming it's the middle of July.

Please... discount the gimmicks and give Tangerine a miss. Maybe someone will do a film like this properly in the future, but for now just avoid this cheap and boring movie.

ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS: Sense8 covered some similar themes and delivered superior performances compared to this tosh - and if you really must watch scripted reality watch something like TOWIE instead... at least in that they respect each other as human beings.

I saw this film mentioned on Film 2015, and then it was one of the newest entries in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it looked and sounded like a really interesting film, especially how it was made, so I had to watch it. Basically Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) is a transgender prostitute who has just been released from a 28-day prison sentence, it is Christmas Eve and she meets with her fellow transgender prostitute and friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) in a donut shop in Hollywood. During their conversation, Alexandra accidentally reveals that Sin-Dee's boyfriend and pimp Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating on her with a woman of cisgender (their gender identity corresponds with their biological sex). Sin-Dee is angry and storms out to search the neighbourhood for Chester and the woman, while Alexandra hands out flyers for her evening musical performance, she also argues with a client who refuses to pay for business, the police break up this argument. Armenian cab driver Razmik (Karren Karagulian) is regularly looking for sex workers, he picks up a prostitute, but ejects her when discovering she is not transgender, he later meets Alexandra who gives him fellatio in a car wash, he then returns home for Christmas dinner with the family. Sin-Dee finds the woman she is looking for, Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan), at a motel brothel, she drags her around town to continue searching for Chester, Dinah continually taunts her along the way, but they stop to watch Alexandra at the venue to perform her music show, no other customers have arrived, it is a mostly empty bar. Razmik leaves his family to watch Alexandra's performance, claiming he is working, but he finds out he is too late, while he searches for Sin-Dee, Razmik's mother-in-law follows him. Sin-Dee, Alexandra and Dinah go to the donut shop, Chester arrives and a confrontation takes place, he insists Dinah means nothing to him, Razmik arrives, followed by his mother-in-law, who calls his wife, Razmik's wife arrives with their infant daughter, and the arguing gets more heated, until the donut shop owner calls the police. Razmik and his family return home, Dinah walks back to the brothel, but there is no room for her, outside the donut shop Chester tells Sin-Dee he also slept with Alexandra, upset Sin-Dee leaves and tries to pick up clients, but she gets urine thrown on her verbal abuse, in the end Sin-Dee and Alexandra go to a laundry service to clean up, and they seem to make amends. Also starring Alla Tumanian as Ashken, Luiza Nersisyan as Yeva, Arsen Grigoryan as Karo, Ian Edwards as Nash, Clu Gulager as The Cherokee and Ana Foxx as Selena. Rodriguez and Taylor are fantastic as the almost mismatched two black transgender hookers striding up and down to resolve their issues, the script is full of murky and intimate subject matter, there are the odd icky and vulgar moments, but it is also very funny, the characters constantly calling each other "girl" and "bitch" for example, and it is surprisingly charming. But what makes this film really stand out, it is obviously a low-budget venture, and it was all shot with three iPhone 5s smartphones, giving the film both depth in its observation and a reality show kind of feel, it should be mentioned also that the title relates to the colour of the Los Angeles sky at sunset, overall it is a most engaging and enjoyable comedy drama. Very good!

Just one day event based theme and brilliantly made film. This film was made using iPhone 5s and this is not some film school project. The quality was really top notch, with great performances by all who involved in. I have never seen such perfectly rendered transgender story. I mean no offense, but it looked so real. Hats off to the director, writer and the actors.

Last year, there were some talks about this film's chances at the Oscars, but in the end it did not make. So after that I kind of lost interest in it, but now I had an opportunity to watch and I liked it very much. How a simple story and its simple characters developed were the highlights. You can't predict this stuff, because you won't know what comes after the each twist.

Most of the film takes place on the evening time, so that colour of the sky is what the title represents. I don't think anybody would dislike this film. It was slow, but short and sweet. One of the best films from the 2015. You much choose this to watch for its uniqueness in the filmmaking and the storytelling. In addition to that, it also entertains, so there's your reason to go for it.

Transvestite hooker Sin-Dee Rella gets out of jail. Her friend fellow sex worker Alexandra reveals that her pimp boyfriend Chester has another girl. She goes off looking for Chester and his whore Dinah. Razmik is a cabbie looking for sex with a tranny. He's missing dinner with his conservative Armenian family. When he hears that Sin-Dee is back, he starts looking for her.

This is technically superior when considering its low budget production. Sin-Dee's fierce walks with the pumping music is terrific. Her dragging Dinah around has a tense fun. Razmik getting a girl instead of a tranny is hilarious to me. There is plenty to applaud but I don't find the epic quest to find her boyfriend that compelling. There is a limited amount of tension. It feels like Sin-Dee strutting down the road. It looks more fierce than what's actually happening. There are some good work and I hoped for more compelling writing.

First of all, I am not trans but I thought this is a great movie, regardless of one's persuasion. I immediately called my teenage daughter and suggested she see it. It went deeper than I thought it would on many levels. The cab driver picking up the hot hooker and being shocked when she did NOT have a dick was to me very interesting and I think helps people understand the trans mindset; which seemingly to date has usually been stereotypical for the most part. The connections were all very real; more than most movies. I especially liked the 2 leads looking out for each other. Mya Alexander to me shines in this and has a real shot at big traditional roles. I highly recommend this for all teenagers to help them deal either with any issues they may be going through, or even more so to simply be more accepting. Highest recommendation.

This film tells the story of two transgender prostitutes going around Los Angeles, and an Armenian taxi driver on Christmas Eve. Their day becomes more eventful by the minute.

I had no idea what "Tangerine" is about, and I was in for a surprise. The film basically follows the day of the three individuals, and it does so with much realism. There is so much drama in the story, with people shouting and screaming and fighting all the time. The film looks interesting and artsy, but it is not exactly my thing. However, the final showdown in the doughnut shop is hilarious, and makes the rest of the film worth watching.

Is Tangerine a wake up call for Hollywood? Shot on an iPhone S5 by Sean Baker, it shows the way to the technological revolution that awaits cinema. Shot for $100,000 (not that expensive) for an Indy, the story line is simple to follow: on Christmas eve, a Black trans sex worker out of 28 days in jail, hears a rumor that her squeeze Chester is having it on with a fish (argot for a real woman, a vagina). She goes off to find him and the white gal he is shagging. Sin Dee (Rella) angrily played by Kitana Kiki Rodriguez walks the mean streets of Los Angeles in search of her unfaithful lover. Tangerine is a road film, and in that the story is formulaic. What makes it unusual is life on the streets of trans sexual sex workers. Sin Dee's friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) is a voice of 'reason'. The hip hop music moves the story along, and songs such as 'I'm fake' lends a bathos to the film. The make-believe world of dreams exists along side the realism and ugliness of the streets and the violence and danger to limb and body. As she soulfully sings 'Toyland' the sentimentality of grim life becomes exposed. Along with finding her 'straight' rival, a parallel story plays out: a married taxi driver, an Armenian, who gets his jollies off by performing fellatio on transsexual street workers. Hence a sour note of the closeted heterosexual with a fetish for he shes. Technically =, overall, Tangerine has the feel of a mature film in spite of its grit and being street wise. Tangerine has nothing to do with the 1940s song. Its transsexual are on the lowest rung of society, far from the glamor of a Caitlin Jenner. The film falls in the trash can school of realism. And yet, although hawked as a 'comedy', there is little to laugh at, except derisively. The mood is very dark, indeed. And the saving grace of life on the outer lanes of existence is the friendship that Sin-Dee and Alexandra maintain through thick and thin.

This movie was pretty reminiscent of Crank and Run Lola Run not in terms of plot but in style and format. The character walking around the city looking for something in this movie reminded me of the guy in Crank running around the city looking for someone as well. Also the feel of the cities in all 3 movies was similar, I think it had to do with the camera work and the lighting, but to me it almost felt like they could be taking place in the same city at the same time. The Synth soundtrack was pretty awesome. It really helped the movie and made it better. The music made it more interesting and made it feel more suspenseful. the plot of the movie is kind of simple but everyone did a pretty good job with the acting. you cared for these people.

The film races you along the streets of Hollywood, introducing you to many a scurrilous deviant along the way as the pulse of the city threatens to swallow your soul with each step taken, driven on by the momentum of the previous giddy step, onwards towards the dramatic showdown. Will there be blood? Will there be tears? Who will win the beaus heart? 

The first impressions the film imposes on the viewer is of an anger so raw and intense that my body went into fight or flight mode. The powerful, when for me at least, surprising protagonist instantly gained a bit of respect from me but more worry about the general mental health of the average LA dweller, known to be abnormal by others standards. The film was a refreshing, shocking, sad and ultimately humbling insight into a world I shall never experience, and it ain't Kansas!

Director Sean Baker is back with one of his low budget wonders, this time shot entirely on an iPhone5s smartphone. The setting is Hollywood and his protagonists are trans-gender prostitutes (or should I say sex-workers?) Sin-dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor).

The opening scene (shot in a donut shop) grabs you right away as just out of jail Sin-dee threatens to find her pimp/boyfriend Chester, who has been cheating on her with a non-transgender woman, Dinah, another prostitute. Alexandra attempts to calm her friend down but Sin-dee is determined to locate the offending parties and mete out her own brand of "justice."

Although it has its moments, the Tangerine plot gets bogged down with Sin-dee's for the most part one note performance. She grabs Dinah's arm (and unconvincingly drags Dinah without any real resistance from her) to a near empty bar where Alexandra is scheduled to perform as a singer. In the bathroom, Sin-dee and Dinah do meth together and then Sin-dee finally softens up and helps Dinah with her hair.

There's a subplot involving an Armenian cabdriver, Razmik, whose preference for trans-gender prostitutes is thwarted when he discovers to his chagrin that he's just invited a non-transgender woman of the night into his cab. Later we discover Razmik is married and his mother-in- law suspects that he's not been working late at night as he's been claiming.

Things come to a head back at the donut shop where Razmik's mother- in- law calls her daughter and she shows up just in time to hear her mother exposing Razmik as having (in her own words) an interest in "gay prostitutes." But the wife doesn't want to hear her mother's concerns and they all return home to sort the rest of the shenanigans out.

Meanwhile, Chester confesses to Sin-dee that he had a one-time affair with Alexandra. Sin-dee stalks off and attempts to hail some cars with johns passing by, but is doused with a noxious liquid. In a touching moment, Alexandra helps Sin-dee clean off and then lets her wear her wig. Dinah is rebuffed at the brothel where Sin-dee first encountered her, as the madam there informs that someone has taken her place.

If all this sounds a bit silly, it is. Score points for the irreverent tone but Sin-dee's quest for "revenge" grows tiresome. Taylor gives the more sensitive performance of the two principals, with Rodriguez displaying less subtlety as a woman with a bad case of anger management. Ultimately, Tangerine, with its message of friendship triumphant, has its heart in the right place, but there's little here that will appeal to the intellect.

Beyond the basic marketing ploys of "shot on iPhone" and "gritty and raw documentary style film about transgender working girls" there's not much to this Sundance darling in terms of actual story and character development.

It's a "found footage" type of movie using the gimmicks of jump cuts (where continuity doesn't matter) and "shaky cam" - where you shouldn't eat or drink beforehand. But nary any story line and plot development or even interesting character development. What the movie establishes in the first 5 minutes is entirely it for the rest of the movie.

It's basically an hour and half of profanities and schmaltzy sentimentality - yes, it's way too sentimental towards the two main characters and can be off putting at times in terms of being like Spielberg manipulation. But I suppose for mainstream audiences comparing this film to Spielberg is a positive selling point.

I totally get it; for some people who aren't witness to LA's Skid Row this is titillation for observing scenarios in the safety of a movie theater or their living rooms. But what lessons are to be learned or call to action for any of the real poverty in LA and around the world?

But for those of us who actually live in LA we can see this everyday for free on the streets - so what's the titillation and novelty for us?

Tokyo Godfathers did it better and that's animation...
