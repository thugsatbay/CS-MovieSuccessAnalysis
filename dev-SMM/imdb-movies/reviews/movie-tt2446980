### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
It's not hard to see why this movie divides people. Some will always find a tale of an under-dog's trial over adversity compelling, no matter how clumsily it's told. And some will find a story about the manufacture of a mop dull, no matter how charismatic the characters or inspirational the telling of the tale. The problem here is that charisma and inspiration are in short supply. David O. Russell doesn't make much of the real strengths of the story. And he can't resist imposing his trademark style on characters and a story that really don't either warrant or suit it. So the characters are more than a little grotesque around the edges; the situations are all heightened, even given an absurdist spin; and the facts are never allowed to get in the way, even when they might actually strengthen the story. So much of Joy is desperately predictable, which makes for dispiriting viewing. And the real moments of surprise or pathos are just so much grist to the Russell mill. Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead, and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's about where the positives end. For the most part, Joy is a tedious mess. While it's a story that would probably never have been told without David O. Russell wanting to enhance it with his schtick, it's a story I wish they'd entrusted to anyone other than David O. Russell.

This is a supposedly "inspirational" kind-of movie based on the life of Joy Mangano a business woman and inventor of home products.

As I'm reading this is far from the actual life of Mangano (who, unlike the Joy in the movie, she went to University and has a degree in business administration). It is more like a blend of the stories of other housewives turned to businesswomen (if you can believe that) and contains lots of fictional elements for dramatic purposes.

Nevertheless the plot is weak. So is the script. There isn't any actual moral here (like "Try and you will succeed"), and the narration of her grandmother dilutes any of that "moral" with too much "it is your destiny" crap.

Soooo, the movie is an empty shell (or should I say Sell, pun intended) but is it fun to watch? No. Not really.

The characters (including Robert De Niro's who plays her father, Elisabeth Röhm's who plays her half-sister, Virginia Madsen's who plays her mother and Isabella Rossellini's who plays her father's girlfriend and serves as the initial investor) are heavily unsympathetic.

The direction is blunt, the pace uneven (I wont spoil you but the resolution of all problems comes in just a few seconds near the end), the situations unbelievable (like going to the...bathroom and unveil a conspiracy by pure luck) etc.

Overall: A blunt movie with weak script and plot. The unsympathetic characters also make this unbearable. Not fun to watch and no true moral in this fictitious sequence of events.

I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.

There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, "Joy" does just that. 

That being said, "Joy" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.

"Joy" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. 

Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with "Joy." It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.

I started watching this movie with high hopes considering it was the work of David O. Russell (who has made some great movies) and highly praised stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro (my favorite actor of all time), and Bradley Cooper. Unfortunately, after the first thirty minutes or so I lost all my hope... it seemed like a childish movie made by an amateur film-maker!

The script was utterly immature. The main message of the movie was female empowerment, a cause worthy of fighting for and to which I say kudos; however, it was represented in the most childish way. Let me give you an example: "You are going to grow up and be a strong, smart young woman. Go to school meet a fine, young man. Have beautiful children of your own. And you're gonna build wonderful things that you do in your room." Sounds like an advice a 14-year-old, obnoxious, recently-turned-feminist girl would give! 

Furthermore, the story was completely disoriented and difficult to follow. One doesn't even know how time passes in the movie! I mean after Joy grows up there's clearly some significant passage of time, judging from some of the major occurrences (for instance grandmother dying, etc.), yet the movie gives absolutely no information about it. I was also bothered when the narrator of the story died in the middle of the story, nevertheless still miraculously narrated the events after her death... this is what I call 'posthumous narration' -- yep, seems legit!

The directing was so horrendous it gave me a freaking migraine! Very rarely one can find a scene in this movie in which the camera is actually stable. I don't oppose to a fluent type of camera movement but in this case it was a continuous, subtle, yet super annoying jerky motion that went on and on and on...

Moreover, there are certain scenes in which the acting is incredibly fake. For example, the scene in which Joy walks out of the garage just before releasing her anger by shooting -- never seen this fake of an acting from Jennifer Lawrence before. (I kind of think it's a directing problem though, considering the high level acting Jennifer Lawrence can perform, the director could have and should have repeated that scene)

In conclusion, the movie was disappointingly weak and boring. I certainly do not recommend it.

I really tried to liked or at least understand this movie but it seem to be an impossible task. I keep it brief - imagine that the screenplay is written by several schizophrenics who fight over whether they write a comedy, drama, melodrama or anything in between throughout the film. Characters come and go without realizing what they should bring to the story. Add poor Isabella Rossellini to the mix (the most bizarre act I have seen in years) who has lines so unbearably surreal no one could possibly carry them without looking like a lunatic. Add nightmarish soap opera merging with the plot. Boom! No sense what-so-ever. Jennifer tried really hard to keep this scrambled mess of a movie bearable and to watch she is only reason it is not a complete disaster. I feel dizzy now!

"Joy" is one of the most disappointing films of the year (if not the most). The great cast with names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rossellini gives the sensation to the viewer that "Joy" might be a great film. However, the storyline of a creative woman that lives with her dysfunctional family and invents a mop, becoming a successful woman, has a boring and dull story and consequently screenplay; in addition, the soundtrack is annoying. In the end, "Joy" is a waste of time and talented cast. My vote is three.

Title (Brazil): "Joy: O Nome do Sucesso" ("Joy: The Name of the Success")

(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)

This film is not recommended.

In brief: Clean-up in Aisle 4

GRADE: C

The usually reliable David O. Russell lets down his fine cast of performers in his latest film, Joy, which doesn't quite live up to its title. Except for a strong performance from its lead, the delightful Jennifer Lawrence, the film remains a major disappointment. 

The film is loosely based on the true story of inventor Joy Mangano, but the screenplay also written by its director is a mess that needs to clean up its act. The film swings wildly between comedy and drama but never stays long enough to be effective in either category. Joy, winningly played by Ms. Lawrence, is interesting and the actress brings some verve to her role, but all of the supporting characters around her are sketchy and never amount to much more than quirky curmudgeons whose actions are so over-the-top that they never resemble anything remotely believable.

The plot: Joy's life is in shambles (but then, so is the script). Living slightly above the poverty level and sharing her household with her dysfunctional divorced parents, Terry (Virginia Madsen), a reclusive soap opera addicted mother, and Rudy, a crotchety self-absorbed father (Robert De Niro) who takes up with a rich Italian widow named Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who is trying to be a professional singer, Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm), her jealous stepsister, and Joy's two adorable children. Still her creative impulses compel her take action and change the direction her life is taking, which leads Joy to her long- time friend and adversary in business, Neil (Bradley Cooper), who gives her moral support on her latest venture. 

However, none of these relationships build to any satisfactory conclusion due to the stilted writing and uneven tone of the film. The ending also seems pat and forced as it quickly tries to tie up its loose ends, be they cotton or synthetic.

With all of the talent involved, sadly, Joy is a joyless filmgoing experience.

Well, what can I say? Joy is a plain, boring and uneventful movie lacking great performances from Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence (of course I wasn't expecting much from Bradley Cooper). The plot could have been interesting but the script completely ruined it I am not a fan of David Russell bu he did a really really bad job with Joy: his sequences don t make any sense, the narrator character choice is just pointless and many scenes are really hard to believe in. During the initial part of the movie, there were some funny bits which kept me moderately entertained but, after those 30 minutes, it was just plain boredom. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence won a Golden Globe for this is just unbelievable and proves what we all already know and what Ricky Gervais mentioned at the ceremony: all awards are bought by studios as a marketing campaign. Well, they succeeded, because I spent the money to see that, and I could not regret it more than I do.

Mostly, the everyman applauds when another everyman struggles against odds to find success. Sometime those struggles are herculean. Not the case in "Joy." While the real life, inventive Joy deserves kudos, the bottom line is this is a feature film about the creator of a better mop.

Russell struggles, unsuccessfully, to portray as harrowing the path to the mop. Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), deals with a houseful of kids, only a few of them children by age. The motley crew in a small house is not on Joy's side. She is the breadwinner, the adult, the rock whose imagination is a liability to those overly dependent on her. It's a paint-by-numbers affair from there  familial jealousy, dirty financial dealings, the nightmare foretold by the old saw, "Do not do business with your family."

The only one with an eye on Joy's genius is Grandma (Diane Ladd). Joy uses her small crumb of encouragement to build a mop prototype. She brings it to QVC where the initial sale segment bombs. Slick QVC huckster Bradley Cooper takes a chance and allows Joy to showcase the mop herself. Bingo! The mop sells out. Success? Nope. The parts supplier is screwing Joy, every sale of the mop loses money, and the family wants their money back. Financial ruin follows. Then Grandma dies. But the plucky Joy womans up to settle all scores financial and emotional. Hoorah!

In lieu of dramatizing a woman overcoming, Russell instead created a painfully unfunny comedy. His palette is broad with a spectrum of quirkies mincing about with a family dynamic that could only exist in a poorly written movie like "Joy." The spot-on Russell eventually had to fall. "Joy" is the X marking the spot.

Made-for-this-film, unfunny soap opera segments are unmotivated. There is no subtext pointing to the off-TV characters. There's also no payoff. There are out-of-left-field scenes of the soap in the first quarter and it's never seen again. What's the point? 

The Cooper-Lawrence chemistry bright and vibrant in past screen pairings is absent in "Joy." Here, it's given way to forced discomfort. There's a sense Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro at some point knew "Joy" was a dog and tried hard to not phone it in. That or their direction was, "You've just been hit by a phaser on stun."

The tonally confused "Joy" offers little on the path to an unsatisfying end where Joy makes it big, big, big and helps others succeed.

There's little sympathy for Joy. The stakes: not living to one's potential and living with unfulfilled dreams. Her children are healthy. Her dad, DeNiro, runs a going concern and could help financially if push came to shove. She's smart and capable of working. Poor Joy.

One wonders about the scores of courageous men and women who daily struggle against far greater odds, wolves at the door, to put bread on the table. Where are tales of these folks? It's an odd and tragic choice for Russell to highlight Joy's story (and insensitive in the current economy where one in seven US children go to bed hungry). The can-do attitude of a person overcoming trials is powerful. Open your eyes, Mr. Russell. There are far better underdog tales to make. They're just not sexy as Lawrence dancing with a mop.

I don't see what the hype is all about. The story is average and done many many times before. Nothing really likable or inspiring about the characters or the story. The acting is nothing notable. Just very standard stuff. Let me cap it in one sentence. Down and out mother thinks up an invention, brings it to market, and becomes rich after some travails that, in reality, is all fought and done with lawyers in the end. That's it. If you watched "The Pursuit of Happiness" the Will Smith movie, you've pretty much seen this one.

And just an off note, these type of movies are ridiculous. For every success story like this one, there are thousands of others who've tried and failed. People who risked the financial well beings of their children and family on an improbable venture because they think themselves special, even though they never done the hard work of getting an education or training. But they still think themselves special. You never hear about them, the losers, the irresponsible ones who ruined the lives of their families. You only hear about the one in a million, like lottery winners. For a society, this isn't healthy when even the dumbest dingbat thinks himself above everyone else, and they're going to be millionaires. I guess that's why people vote Republicans.

My mother is the kind of person who, when walking out of a movie, always has something good to say about it regardless of how bad the movie was. We saw this movie together along with my brother and a friend of mine and when we were walking through the parking lot afterwords she was suspiciously quiet.

I was hesitant to give this movie such a low rating because I can think of movies that were objectively much, much worse but frankly the complete lack of substance makes it hard to give it any kind of rating.

The plot seemed simultaneously dragged out and rushed and contained zero suspense because no legitimate stakes were really raised and even if they had been, I cared so little about the characters that it wouldn't have mattered.

Jennifer Lawrence's character is trying so hard to be The Every Man that it comes across as painfully fake and her performance was very much sub par. Every other performance in the movie was not all that memorable, even in regards to a few bigger name stars.

Two separate characters die over the course of the movie, one of whom is never actually fully seen on screen. Both times Joy seems to have moved on completely by the next scene.

A huge problem this movie had was in its attempt to retain some kind of vaguely political message without actually taking a firm stance on the issues in play. For example, there's a scene that essentially ripping on Joan Rivers for being anti-feminist and yet, we never really see Joy struggling in the work place for being a woman or having her decisions questioned by the men she works for. She seems to have it remarkably easy actually, and most of the things that go wrong are solidly on her. Another aspect of this is in the fact that they're poor and it causes Plot Issues but this is never truly discussed in any meaningful way. We are told that they are poor and that it causes problems, but they never really talk about it nor do they ever seem to face real consequences for the fact.

Really the only positive things I have to say about this movie are: the soundtrack was good when it showcased period appropriate tracks as opposed to generic drama movie background music and I was very glad that Bradley Cooper and Lawrence didn't hook up in this movie.

Overall, exactly as bad as I expected it to be and definitely not worth the watch.

Joy is a fine half a film. The performances all-around are strong, the story is uncommon enough to grab your attention, and keep you invested, and the direction is solid. With all that in mind, Joy still feels like a shallow version of what could have been. There is a reason why all the movie's Oscar buzz has all but dissipated in every category except a courtesy nod to Jennifer Lawrence as Best Actress; Why? You should read on.

Lawrence plays the titular character, a mother of two with a very complicated home life. Though divorced, her ex-husband (Ramirez) lives in the basement waiting for his singing career to take off. Though she has decidedly negative relationships with her parents, her shut-in mother (Madsen) lives with her and her father (De Niro) is a serial divorcée with a struggling auto repair shop. It's also the 1980's and she works the night shift for an Airline that's dramatically cutting back hours; yikes. The only thing she has going for her is she likes to tinker and has the work ethic to see a good idea through. So when she has a eureka moment after a failed excursion on her father's new girlfriend's boat, she quickly invents a household object that may just be her ticket out of systemic poverty.

I don't think I'm giving much away by saying the movie asks its audience to hinge their emotional cache on a mop. The self-wringing Miracle Mop to be exact, invented by honest-to-God real person Joy Mangano. Leave it to director David O. Russell to find a decent story in the life of a QVC luminary and keep it just this side of rational. The prologue of the film lovingly dedicates the movie to "daring women," which Joy certainly is but Russell wisely omits the last name to give the audience a universality. This too can be your story of success if you have grit and a good idea. It's a great theme sadly worth a much better movie.

Part of the problem is the pace. There are long stretches of improvisations that carry absolutely no emotional weight. Unlike American Hustle (2013) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012) where the rushed, overlapping dialogue and melodramatic mugging serves to highlight the immediacy of, say dealing with the mob, here there's nothing holding us to the characters and their goals...except Joy. Russell seems to be aware of his own style and juxtaposes the lives on screen with an 80's era soap opera which consumes the life of Joy's mother. The parallel is interesting in theory but the results deflate the proceedings.

Not usually the voice of hope, I really wanted to like this movie. A movie about the positives of hard work and entrepreneurship has not hit theaters since Pursuit of Happyiness (2006). Yet out of all modern directors working today, David O. Russell feels like a quixotic mouthpiece for such a hopeful theme. His movies always have an unabashed pessimism about human nature that undermines his characters with an almost Bunuelian sense of treachery. Even as far back as his Three Kings (1999) days there was a mercurial, bittersweet undercurrent to his work. Joy bares disappointment after disappointment to a breaking point most protagonists of this genre would buckle under. Then, as if to put a band-aid on an open gash, the movie ends with an epilogue that's pat to the point of flimflam.

David O Russel is a good director. "I heart huckabees",

now this is a great film, with lot of ideas and inspiration.

"Three Kings", "The Fighter", and the two previous with Lawrence, i enjoy all of them "Joy" is not even a mediocre movie, it is a bad movie, with a terrible and naive script. A failure in every level. Actors performances are good but they cannot save any movie like this. Every minute, it was getting worst and worst, there are no words to describe this mess, i wish i could say it better but my English are not that good, my English are on the same level with this film:Αwful. And what was the message of this film?That there is still hope in a materialistic world and we should chase our dreams, even when all seem against us? Maybe interrupt and invade to a board meeting of a powerful company and confront the CEO? Come on, a director should respect the audience. If you want to direct a fairy tale,OK, i like fairy tales but don't present me an uninspiring fairy tale as a realistic movie, "based on a true story". Even if it was a true story, it is not convincing. Please, respect the audience. A talented director like O Russel should not forget it

Joy presents itself as an attempt of a fresh take on a very typical Oscar-bait movie: the biopic. Sadly, it doesn't go beyond the attempt.

Joy Mangano (Lawrence) is a poor and overworking divorced mother of two children who lives with her dysfunctional family that in addition to being completely dependent on her are also faithless on her ability to be more than a house wife that will always struggle to get some food on the table. Despite all the negative influence, Joy's imagination and ambition are powerful and she manages to invent a revolutionary mop, which she will try to develop and sell. Despite the fact that this mop eventually turns into a success, she has to endure a path of betrayal, jealousy and corruption (starting with her own family), hardships that she will surpass (or else this would have never become a movie).

What first caught my eye (or in this case, hear) was the soundtrack. Composed by some famous jazz, classical and rock-and-roll songs, the music was highly responsible for other positive features of this film: a frenetic pacing and a very light atmosphere. These two features added to some quirky dialogues and surrealistic dream sequences and flashbacks gave this film a very interesting potential, that could have turned the very basic plot into a fulfilling experience.

However, Joy remains as flat as the synopsis would suggest. The underdeveloped characters made impossible for any actor to perform well here. Even Joy, the title character, seemed exactly the same during the whole movie (the only reason I see possible for Jennifer Lawrence winning that Golden Globe is that she did the most what she could with almost zero material - and I don't want to believe that she was the most deserving actress of the year.) The whole family seemed like one-dimensional caricatures of pessimistic morons, which lead to completely forgettable performances by everyone involved. There was also a very short appearance of Bradley Cooper as an executive who first believed in Joy's idea, but whose character suffers from the same problem as the rest. There seemed to be a slightly romantic chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence that I found completely needless, as it lead to nowhere. Another very distracting feature was the constant out-of-focus framing, especially on indoor scenes! Amateurish, to say the least.

Overall, I think David O. Russel tried to do something different from a biopic which is something I respect very much! The fact that he focused on a very particular moment of Joy's life, the invention of the mop, could be something he could have explored better, but in the end we are left with just that, which is kind of frustrating... To finish where I started, Joy could have been a good movie, but ends being nothing more than a typical hollow Oscar bait.

If you think the story of a woman whose claim to fame is that she invented a 'miracle mop' and made millions selling it via TV shopping channels sounds a poor basis for a movie, watching Joy will do little to change your opinion. Despite its claims, there is little that is 'inspirational' or even particularly interesting about Joy Mangano's progress from schoolgirl to 'matriarch', at least as portrayed in this quasi-biopic.

The film starts interestingly by thrusting the viewer into a 1980s (? - it could have been 1950s) TV soap. At this point I thought Joy would perhaps be a comedic satire on the inanities of American consumerism. With a few tweaks it could have become just that and how much more interesting and challenging that would have been.

The quirky opening note rapidly fades. We soon discover that Joy's story is going to be told by her granny, a prospect that does not bode well if you are looking for gritty realism and objectivity. Since granny dies halfway through the film, we then realise that the whole thing is being narrated from beyond the grave. Poignant? No, spooky and sentimental at best. From there on the plot lumbers along conventional channels to its predetermined conclusion.

As the movie progresses it becomes more leaden, especially when we encounter the head of a TV shopping channel (Bradley Cooper). He comes across as a stereotypical corporate carthorse, who truly believes that pulling his telly-shopping cart is a higher calling. When Joy succeeds, at the second attempt, in presenting her miracle mop to the World on live TV and the sales indicator goes ballistic, the studio erupts with an ovation reminiscent of the one in Mission Control when the Apollo 11 astronauts touched down on the Moon. Hey guys, calm down - it's just a mop! If Joy's triumph seems a bit too good to be true, the credibility of the ensuing story is not enhanced by demonstrations of very poor business acumen on both her and her advisers parts. She would have got nowhere on Dragon's Den! When later Joy discovers she has been double-crossed in her business dealing by a most improbable circumstance, we begin to wonder if granny has got her facts straight.

One has to conclude that this rather unexciting movie is basically a star vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence. Visually, fans will not be disappointed as she is displayed in numerous full-length shots and close-ups. But the role has too little meat in it to demand much of Lawrence in the way of acting. Robert de Niro, reprising his Jack Byrnes (Meet the Fockers) character, brings some bright moments to the proceedings, not least with a very funny wedding speech. But the occasional humour sits uneasily with the serious intent of the movie to tell an uplifting tale of a woman's successful struggle against adversity.

Unless you think American consumer culture really is something to get worked up over, it may prove difficult to be fully engaged by the inspirational tone of Joy. That aside, there is little here to lift this movie above the ordinary. Talk of awards and even Oscars seems wholly misplaced; one critic even describes Joy as on a par with the Hollywood classics. No wonder they say you should never believe what you read in the papers - nor what you see on the tele-shopping channels!

I had to give this a one out of ten. Only because you can not give it zero. So I do apologize for not giving an accurate score. This was not a David O'Russell film, it has his usual cast but he is no where to be found. The story draws out its quite obvious and inevitable finally for 2 long hours. You know at some point she will become a billionaire...and you wait and wait and wait and they draw it out and then...shazam!... she is a billionaire. There were a couple of moments that reminded me of the dysfunctional family set up you might find in a Wes Anderson film...but then that drops away very quickly...and there is no other time that it comes close to art or great cinema in the way that ''American Hustle'' or ''I Heart Huckabees'' did.I don't know where he was going with this one.

Where do I start when the best things about the film were a short audio clip of the Buffalo Springfield song, "Expecting to Fly" and Susan Lucci playing a soap opera character (thus the 2-star rating)? I found the dialogue to be filled with clichés, the acting quite flat (especially Jennifer), and many of the scenes so implausible that I could not "buy into" the storyline. The film dragged...Bradley Cooper was underused...the hairstyles seemed out-of-sync for the time...the daughter uttered lines and behaved in a way that even a mature little girl would never say/do...the relationship with the half sister was confusing...and why did the mother always have a bowl in her hands? Also, seriously: who in their RIGHT MIND hand-wrings a mop that is filled with shards of glass? Girl, get a towel, scoop up the shards, and shake them out over the trash can!

Bottom line: An uplifting and perhaps compelling true story does not always translate into a good film.

Joy is the third time David O Russell, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper have worked together, and this time its meh. It's an average film, not amazing, not awful, just OK. This film is one for the feminists, a woman becoming successful no matter how much the white man tells her no.

The only likable character in this film is Joy herself (her ex husband as well sort of). Everyone else in the film is so irritating as they are such horrible people especially toward Joy, who they treat more like a slave than there blood relative. This does help in making the audience like Joy even more but it also wants them to see her gun them down in the films climax, which I'm sad to say does not happen.

I don't know why the film was narrated by Joy's grandmother, I guess either to save money or Morgan Freeman was busy.

One other thing which I thought was particularly good about Joy was it's parody of soap operas and how they are complete and utter bull, but lazy and stay at home mothers lap up every second of it. I believe that, because of this, the film gained it's comedy genre as this film is not funny at all and it doesn't even seem to try, I do not understand why its been given that genre.

Plus I swear Joy was an absent parent to her son as she does have one, we just see her spend time with only her daughter, this is probably more due to the feminist messages the film aims to convey but because of the amount of things Joy has to juggle, it to me, came across more that she (and the filmmakers) simply forgot about him.

Joy's OK, it isn't at all high on my recommendation list but if anyone was thinking of seeing Joy I wouldn't encourage or discourage them.

How can you not like a movie with Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Niro? Take a David O. Russell screenplay only half based on entrepreneur Joy Magano's invention of the Miracle Mop, fill it with a series of implausible straw men, then knock them down over the course of two hours leading to the happy ending we all know is coming because it's the story of the successful Miracle Mop, not the Flop Mop. People have analogized Joy's situation to Cinderella, but it seemed to me more like Rocky. Each time poor Joy takes a punch and hits the canvas, we are rooting for her ("Get up, Joy!"). The problem is that each setback is completely avoidable and, thus, becomes infuriating to the viewer. Examples: Marketing guru, Bradley Cooper, agrees to get her product on QVC but gives it to a pitchman who has never used the product and doesn't like it. When Joy insists on demonstrating the product herself (which did happen), she is dressed in a fancy outfit- just the thing you'd wear when mopping a floor! Genius, Bradley Cooper! Then the parts supplier attempts to extort Joy by raising the prices after the success of the product. What, no contract covering this? When Joy learns her intellectual property rights are not protected, it is explained that her financial backer- who meticulously monitors the expenditure of every penny- has consulted a lawyer who is not an expert in IP rights. How meticulous! Everyone but Joy throws their hands up in despair saying there is nothing to be done but file bankruptcy. Here's a thought. How about suing the lawyer for legal malpractice for giving IP advice without any expertise? When Joy learns that the real IP holder is in Texas, Joy meets him in a motel room, spins out some convoluted explanation as to why his claim over the IP rights is "fraud" and gets him to sign a one page disclaimer of all IP rights right then and there without years of litigation. The longer this movie went on, the more I hated it. Except for Joy, none of the characters were likable. Some critics apparently find it impossible to be objective because of the pedigree of the David O Russell, JLaw, Bradley Cooper collaboration (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle). But, many IMDb viewers have been courageous enough to say this emperor had no clothes and I joint their ranks.

I had no idea what this film was about-I just thought it might be good because of Jennifer Lawrence. Boy was I wrong. I suppose if compared to being in a hurricane or a flash flood-this movie would definitely come out on top-but as a 'movie for entertainment purposes' it belittles the audience and the people on the screen rendering them mere caricatures of people-not real people at all. That is strange to see-actors with talent wasted on what is basically nothing but a dumb movie project that isn't even worth being a movie of the week on some family orientated cable station. There were other things that didn't work in relationship to this movie-an endless 45 minute "preshow" from the movie chain that treated the adult audience as if they were all in grade seven. Going to the movies has become virtually a waste of time-especially if this is the type of thing they expect people to go for. I heard the positive reviews by critics but I don't see any positive reviews from an cinema goers. Everybody seemed to think this movie was ridiculous. I know I do. Its a movie about a woman who designs a mop. That's right-a mop. Unbelievable.

This movie is complete and utter garbage.

This "true story" is completely fabricated and faker than the soap opera scenes that intersperse this movie. What's worse is the director knew he was making a garbage film but because it contained two stars he worked with in American Hustle he just kept throwing in references to other, superior films, such as Taxi Drive and Citizen Kane.

There is so much here that violates the laws of the suspension of disbelief, for instance, somehow the restroom has a secret door blocked by a few boxes that lead into the main manufacturing plant that holds the smoking gun that Joy's plans are being stolen.

Joy has to hire a plumber and then suddenly her bed-ridden mom who only watches soap operas is cavorting around the house with the Haitian plumber offering bowls of soup to Joy. For no reason. They just interrupt the scene.

Everything about this film is stupid and insulting. There are B-movies made in the 1950s that have more integrity and artistic merit. This whole film is a sell-out on the highest order and a class action lawsuit should be filed so that people who paid actual money to see this disaster could get some compensation.

There are many times where I, as the viewer, wished that Jenifer Lawrence had a bow and arrow and could go Katniss Everdeen on the rest of the characters.

Bradley Cooper seemed like he was reciting lines in a hypnotic trance. In fact, the whole cast seemed as if they were under some somnambulist's spell, robotically reciting lines that had been poured into their heads by some careless programmer, ambivalent of how his automatons performed. As if by some government worker who would get paid regardless of the quality of his work.

There is nothing redeeming here. There is no quality. There is no charm. Everyone was tasked to do a job and no matter how bad it was, they were just going to get through.

Money corrupts. Not an original theme, yet this is what this movie is about. It lambasts most, if not all, of the major social institutions of modern society. Marriage, commerce, the mass media, work, the law - all are targeted for negative treatment. The problem is that none of this is surprising, new or insightful. Essentially, the movie is a soap opera, and not very good one. All the characters are flawed. Most remarkable is their intellectual shallowness equaled only by their selfishness and greed. The principal character, a woman named Joy, invents something and then immediately encounters difficulties trying to market it. She depends on others who repeatedly let her down. Finally, after repeatedly being ripped off, the light goes on inside her head. She finally realizes that people are not nice. Once she understands that, she becomes a success. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper deliver strong performances. Robert DeNiro is okay as Joy's stupid father. However, this is not one of DeNiro's better performances. DeNiro tries to give his character some depth, but he fails because his character is simply too intellectually limited.

My wife thought Joy looked interesting so we went. I figured it would be a "chick flick", but was happy to keep her company.

Less than an hour into the movie, she turned to me and said "are you ready to go? I am!" Great news for me, even though neither of us had ever walked out of a movie.

The plot was stupid, and the actors did not seem to be into it. If the whole ridiculous family situation was historically accurate, it sure was not portrayed well in the movie.

I expected a "5" movie; my wife expected an "8". We both rate it as a "1".

This film is nothing more than a bunch of clichés strung together. I didn't believe one minute of it.

It wasn't the actors fault there was just nothing for them to act with and don't get me wrong I love a good "poor girl done good" story like Erin Brockovich but this was just tedious.

I am also a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but this is the worst film to date I have seen her in and I can't believe there was talk about an Oscar for her performance in it.

It has nothing to redeem it. Some of the cinematography was interesting but again didn't add anything to the story. Everybody was cardboard and every scene just made me more and more angry that I was wasting my time watching it.
