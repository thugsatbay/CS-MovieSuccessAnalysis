### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Saving Mr Banks tells the story of Walt Disney's battle to get the rights to make Mary Poppins into a movie. I wasn't expecting to like this but was completely blown away. 

It is beautifully put together, is hilarious in parts and very touching and emotional at other stages, but is not overly sappy or cheesy. 

There are some outstanding performances here. Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers beautifully - a cantankerous and stubborn lady, yet you can't dislike her. Tom Hanks does a good job of playing Walt Disney - a tough role for anyone but he seems to suit it, so long as you can get past the terrible fake southern accent which is worse than Dick Van Dyke's attempts at an English accent in Mary Poppins. 

However the stand-out performance is, surprisingly, delivered by Colin Farrell as Mrs Travers' father. He brings amazing range and emotion to a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man caged in by life and personal demons. 

Go see it for yourself when it comes out at the end of November. I'm looking forward to watching it again.

Once upon a time (seeing as though that's how all fairy tales seem to  start), there lived a boy from Missouri, called Walt Disney. This boy  had a piece of paper with a mere sketch of a mouse upon it. Who ever  would have thought that this was to be the start of such a great  legacy? 
In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of "Mary Poppins",  to his California studios to discuss the possibility of acquiring the  rights to her book - a discussion that Mr. Disney had initially sparked  twenty years prior. For those two decades, the proud author refused to  depart with her precious work in fear of Hollywood's mutilation of it  and repeatedly told Mr. Persistent to go 'fly a kite up to the highest  heights'. However, when sales of her book begin to dwindle and with a  rough economic climate ahead, Travers reluctantly agreed to travel  across the Atlantic to hear what the impresario had to say. This untold  backstory of how Travers' classic work of literature made it to the big  screen provides the substance for John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks.  
Here, we have an American icon that plays an American icon. Two-time  Academy Award winner Tom Hanks delivers extraordinary sense of  character as he renders Mr. Walt Disney with expert attention to  detail. "There's a lot of voice work, the way he walks, the body  positions, the way he holds his hands, the way he touches his  moustache. How he phrases things and lets sentences roll off the end",  Hancock remarks - and so Tom Hanks becomes the public face for Walt  Disney and we learn of the man behind the mask (with two fluffy ears). 
Our central protagonist is Mrs. P. L Travers, played by Emma Thompson  (who similarly boasts two Academy Awards). "She was a wonderful case  study, requiring so many different shades. She was just so complex.  She's one of the most complicated people I've ever encountered", says  the British actress. Her rendition of a tetchy and cantankerous author  who's plagued by the memories of her past is brilliantly executed.  
As narrative flashbacks delve into Mrs. Travers' childhood, we soon  realise the true depth of her literary creation, Mary Poppins. Mr.  Banks explores the bond between a young Travers (then Helen) and her  drunkard father, Travers Goff (exceptionally played by Colin Farrell).  Like a puzzle, the story is pieced together, bit by bit and we learn  that her deep-seated adoration for her father is what lies at the heart  of her magical masterpiece.  
Demonstrating that her novel holds such personal significance, Travers  continues to exercises a stubborn reluctance to hand the rights to her  book over to what she considers to be a dollar-printing machine. The  straight-talking novelist is repulsed by Disney's empire and this is  only intensified when the entertainment wizard showers her in all kinds  of ridiculous merchandise. As Walt Disney haplessly pursues Travers,  unsettling the adamant writer with his vision of the film, it seems  that he will never obtain the rights to make the movie of Mary Poppins.  We are, of course, watching this in hindsight and the knowledge that  the book was made into a successful film adds a magical quality to the  experience and permits laughter as it plays on dramatic irony; and  there are some real gems for the Disney die-hards. 
Walt Disney made a promise to his daughter to make the movie of Mary  Poppins. As the likelihood of fulfilling this promise fades into the  distance, the entertainment-guru reaches into his own childhood and  discovers a new, more personal connection to the emotionally troubled  Travers. In order to break away from a life dictated by her past,  Travers agrees to sign the waiver so that one the most lovable films in  cinematic history can be made. 
This biographical dramedy stands as a poetic tale of hope, which  ultimately gives testament to the might of the mouse house and conveys  the magical idea that everybody has a story to tell. Making memories is  what Disney is all about and for its 125-minute runtime, we re-visit  old memories and we also create new ones. With all the conventions of a  family film (after all, this is Disney), Saving Mr. Banks is  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! (Couldn't resist).

Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand. To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a winner.

But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness, family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for waterworks throughout the two hours.

What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in check.

In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.

Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr. Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praiseeven if you won't see all the details behind the true story on screen.

This movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film.

i attended a pre-screening of "Saving Mr. Banks" last night in Dallas. while i had been looking forward to the film, i had my reservations. after all, Johnny Hancock (director) was behind "The Blind Side," which i found much too schmaltzy and watered-down for my taste. also, this was a movie about Walt Disney being produced by his company - so how honest would it be about the story behind the making of the masterpiece "Mary Poppins"? would it settle for predictable mellow-drama (yes, i meant to spell it that way) and glorify dear Uncle Walt as perfect and demonize Mrs. Travers as a cold, soulless spoilsport? thankfully, the answer to that is a resounding "no."

while it surely takes artistic license with history, the film as a whole is surprisingly great. there's not a weak moment throughout, not a second where i wasn't entertained and wanting to find out what would come next. this film (rated PG-13) surprises with many of the thematic issues it tackles, including alcoholism, loss - and we even get a brief glimpse of a smoking Mr. Disney (hey, it was the 60s).

Emma Thompson has always been a strong performer though her screen time has waned over the last decade and a half, but here she gives a performance that is worthy of awards attention. As Mrs. P.L. Travers, she is an author as protective as her life's work as a mother is for a child and is dealing with demons nearly forgotten. Mr. Hanks too carries his own playing the iconic and visionary Disney at the top of his game, trying to honor a promise to his daughters while also add to his impressive repertoire of cinematic achievements.

this is not really a film to take your Poppins-loving tykes to. this is the Disney film for mom and dad to enjoy. "Saving Mr. Banks" will probably be remembered as one of the best films of 2013, and for good reason.

Surprising in the Most Delightful Way

Despite watching the trailer and knowing the broad story, Saving Mr.  Banks still managed to surprise me. It's a beautiful, tender film that  manages to be sad without being mawkish, funny without detracting from  the emotion and with far greater depth than expected. 
Unfolding the story of Walt Disney's attempt to persuade P.L. Travers  to sell him the rights to her beloved Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks is  a delightful film that is deceptively emotional and flows smoothly  enough to be entirely engaging. 
Travers (Emma Thompson) thwarts Disney's (Tom Hanks) attempts to secure  the rights for twenty years until a flatlining bank balance and a  mildly panicking agent persuade her to at least consider Disney's  proposition or lose her home with certainty. Whisking her to Hollywood  and bombarding her with all things Disney, the master of the House of  Mouse spares no expense or effort to woo Mrs Travers and persuade her  to allow him to keep his promise to his daughters to film the books  they loved so much. But nothing prepares him for the stubborn, exacting  curmudgeon who challenges him at every twist and turn and demands and  demeans in equal measures. 
After the recent Captain Phillips, in which Hanks was astounding, there  is a very good chance that he may join an exclusive group (of twelve so  far, including co-star Emma Thompson) of actors to be nominated for two  Oscars in the same year. Even more rarely, he'll deserve both  nominations! Quite simply, it is impossible to imagine another actor in  the role of Uncle Walt. He oozes charisma and his smile is used for so  much more than merely expressing happiness. There is a genuine warmth  to Hanks' performance and this is one of those rare occasions where I  temporarily forgot I was watching him. He's been a very good actor for  many, many years, but this year I've had to reassess my opinion of him  and state that he has transcended his deserved 'movie stardom' to  become a very fine actor indeed. 
Unsurprisingly (and most welcome), Hanks is matched every single step  of the way by Thompson. There is a magical thawing in her Travers in  the course of Saving Mr. Banks where she pokes her head out of her  hard, crispy chrysalis and threatens to become a warm(ish), witty  woman. Early on in the film, it is difficult to like Travers as her  demands become more extreme, her retorts more cutting and her demeanour  downright unpleasant, but Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay  weaves the story of the film rights with the tale of Travers' troubled  childhood to give reason for her crustiness and context to her literary  creation. It is this aspect of Saving Mr. Banks that surprises most and  completes the film. 
Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) approaches each side of his  female protagonist's life very differently and her buried history is  shot in muted, dusty colours with a jagged Western romanticism that  tempers the bleak happenings that shaped the girl into the woman. Colin  Farrell is on his best form for years as Travers Goff, the drunk father  who lives in his own fantastic world of imagination and adventure to  escape the harsh reality of the real world. He is a man who fails  consistently and knows it, but loves his daughter unequivocally. As  with Hanks and Thompson, the chemistry between Farrell and Annie Rose  Buckley (playing Ginty, the young Travers) is effortlessly beautiful. 
The casting is just one of the joys of Saving Mr. Banks, with Paul  Giamatti chief amongst the supporting actors as Travers' driver, Ralph,  a doleful puppy in human form that responds to every brush-off and  verbal slap with another smile and encouraging word. In the studio  Bradley Whitford as screenwriter Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason  Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers bring more gentle humour as  Travers' desperate, unwilling adversaries. There's no lazy leaning  towards slapstick or cheap shots, rather Hancock steers their scenes  gently allowing both the frostiness and the occasional sprinkles of  sunlight to sparkle with sincerity. 
There are hints of Travers' adult life beyond her books but, though  comments remain, it feels as though the backstory was excised for the  final cut and so I came away from the film feeling that something was  missing. The final act is perhaps a little too tidy; it glides towards  a resolution too smoothly and nothing is made of the rumoured aftermath  of the deal, but these are minor niggles in a beautiful film that  carries one along and moistens the eyes occasionally. 
Saving Mr. Banks is an unqualified success. It is a joy to watch and  leaves one hoping that Mary Poppins earns yet another screening in this  year's Christmas TV schedule.

I think the wrong way to view the new film, Saving Mr. Banks, is as the making of Disney's classic, Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is really about storytelling as both truth and escape, as well as a film about fathers. 

The film tells the true story of how Mary Poppins author, P.L. Travers, came to Disney Studios for two weeks in 1961, as Walt Disney and his ace crew of creatives tried to convince the ill- tempered Travers to allow them the rights to make Mary Poppins. 

I think it's safe to say that we all know how the film ultimately ends, but how we get there is such an emotional journey that it is worth embarking upon. Emma Thompson portrays P.L. Travers with enough emotion buried within the subtext of her words that we care about this woman who is not all that immediately likable on the page, and in lesser hands the role would have been just that. Meanwhile, Tom Hanks plays the part of Walt Disney himself, with a twinkle in his eye, and yet he also manages to bring his trademark everyman quality to old Walt himself and make Walt not seem as if he's some myth, but rather a real man. However, the big mistake that many seem to be making with this film is that it's a movie about Walt Disney, and while Disney is a very important character in the film, this is P.L. Travers' story.

Through flashbacks we witness Travers' childhood in Australia and her relationship with her alcoholic banker father, Travers Goff, who was the inspiration for Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins, and is portrayed in this film by Colin Farrell with a charming, yet tragic likability. We witness how much of Travers' childhood went on to inspire Mary Poppins, and it's through these flashbacks that Saving Mr. Banks finds its heart. Without us seeing what P.L. Travers went through, it's hard for us to understand why she is so against Disney transforming, what is essentially, her own past into a film. This allows us to relate to this hard to relate to woman, which is the brilliant stroke of director John Lee Hancock and screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. As a matter of fact, if there is one word to describe Saving Mr. Banks for me, it is brilliant.

It is rare to see a film made by a major studio with this kind of thematic density, and that is why this is such a brilliant motion picture. There is an honesty to the way the film deals with the idea of fathers and that while they may not be infallible, they can still be saved. Then there are the thematic ideas of storytelling that ring so true to me as a storyteller myself. Whether we realize it or not, the stories we tell are reflections of ourselves and our own lives. Walt says it best late in the film when he points out that the true power of imagination and story is to lend hope, and I think that is why anyone deep down tells a story, and I think that idea sums up Disney's entire career.

There just aren't that many kind of films like Saving Mr. Banks in these cynical days, but if you allow yourself to feel, you will be swept away. This is a Disney movie, through and through. There are laughs and moments of soaring emotion throughout, and I wouldn't want anything different from a film made by Disney. Every time you hear, "Let's Go Fly a Kite," your spirit soars and as you watch the film, the song begins to take on a whole new meaning that makes it an even more life affirming song than you perhaps ever thought of it as before. It's not merely a great toe-tapper that closes a film, it's a song of hope.

I just can't say enough about Saving Mr. Banks, I loved it and I think everyone should see this film. The funny thing about all this is, is that without the film Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks would not exist, and yet Saving Mr. Banks is a film that manages to improve upon what is already a near perfect classic and perhaps even best it. From now on, every single time you watch Mary Poppins, the many events and ideas of that film will take on a whole new meaning. In fact, I can't wait till the next time I see Mary Poppins again to see how it may affect me more strongly on an emotional level now knowing more of the story. Saving Mr. Banks is just a miraculous kind of movie that we need more of. It's classic Hollywood drama, so if you want my advice, bring a hankie and just enjoy yourself.

I give Saving Mr. Banks a 10 out of 10!

From the studio that brought you Mary Poppins, Disney has released a biopic about the author of the original novels, P.L Travers. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental.

Mrs. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has been hounded by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the Disney Corporation for 20 years for the film rights to her book and she has refused constantly. But by 1961, she has run out of money and agrees to go to Los Angeles for two weeks to work with the writing team to see if a deal can be struck. Her conditions are that the film cannot be animated, there are no songs and she has final script approval. Travers quickly clashes with creative team and Walt himself, a man who promised his daughters he would adapt the book.

As this is going on Travers reflects on her childhood in rural Australia, with her father (Colin Farrell), a loving man who feeds his daughter's imagination, but an alcoholic with probable depression and how these events influenced her writing.

Saving Mr. Banks is a film armed with excellent screenplay and a top notch cast. As well as the likes of Thompson, Hanks and Farrell, Saving Mr. Banks also features Bradley Whittaker, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak and Ruth Wilson. They all offer strong performances and have given us very well defined characters. Thompson dominates as Travers, a no nonsense woman with poor social skills and a British Bulldog stubbornness/determination and injects a deadpan humour with the witty lines she was given. Thompson also brings out the emotion, the serious aspects of the character, as the shadows of her past still linger over her.

One of the big themes of the film is the writing process, both the individual, personal aspect and the collaborative effect of a film adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks shows that many writers use they personal experience and life and become a part of the author. It is hard for writers to let go and particularly for Travers, as she has so much invested in Mary Poppins, so much of herself in it. Her books allowed her to have some wish fulfilment.

The screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, director John Lee Hancock and editor Mark Livoisi worked brilliant to blending the story of Travers butting heads with Disney's creative team and her backstory about her childhood influencing her writing. There are plenty of transitions, allowing Hancock to have some fancy pans. One particular noticeable sequence is when the creative team performs one of the songs and Travers has a flashback. The film slowly reveals how Travers childhood and her father became a part of her writing, used in the books and become a part of the themes of her books and philosophies. This is particularly the case with her parents and their inabilities to cope, both Travers' father's alcoholism and mother's inability to cope with the stress, leading to her theme of responsibility. For a film that is about the writing process, Saving Mr. Banks never really shows about the writing process that Travers goes through, but explores the writing process of adapting a work, from one medium to another.

The final theme and a big part of the comedy comes from the clashes of cultures and personalities. Travers is a brash personality with formal, conservative approach and lives a modest lifestyle in London and a rustic life in Australia. This in comparison to the overtly friendly American and their glamour and excess, from the fashion to the food, particularly sweet treats and the hard sell from Disney in Travers' hotel room.

Saving Mr. Banks has a excellent screenplay, solid direction and balances the comedy dramatic portions extremely well. The film makes sure there is plenty of sentiment, particularly with the score by Thomas Newman. It is a safe film, but still a pleasing experience. It is perfect if you are a fan of Mary Poppins and you will have the songs stuck in your head.

"Saving Mr. Banks" is easily one of the best movies to come out this year. It tells the tale behind the making of Disney's beloved classic "Mary Poppins," but it is so much more than just a typical 'making of a movie' movie. While many of these types of films aren't as good as the movie they are about, this one is different. It feels like a companion piece to the beloved classic. It allows us to appreciate the trials and tribulations Disney had to go through to make his magnum opus. However, it is also more about P.L. Traverse and why she loves her character so much and why Mary Poppins holds such a special place in her heart.

Director John Lee Hancock does a great job of making this film something truly special. He balances witty humor with emotional depth, but does so without being too sappy or melodramatic. The film is also well written by being more personal than just being a movie about making a movie. The themes of letting and moving on are handled well and really becomes relatable to anyone watching.

The performances are top-notch. Tom Hanks makes a pretty good Disney and he isn't sugar coated either. The real standouts are Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell. They give strong dimensional performances that makes us truly care and sympathies with the characters.

Overall "Saving Mr. Banks" is a truly great and beautifully told film. Its individual parts may not be the years best, but as a complete film it is the whole package. It's a movie that exemplifies why we go to the movies and what Disney stands for as an entertainment corporation. It is a movie that is equal parts heartfelt, witty, charming, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying. I give it 5/5

"Saving Mr. Banks" is an exquisite film. It draws you in with the delightful reality of Disney as well as the triumphantly stark reality (inasmuch as it is reality; I do lack her background) of Mrs. Travers. I purposely leave out parts of the film for the sake of the movie-goer, but let me say how delightful the songs are, the people are, the displays of emotion-- my part as well, as I nearly cried and fully laughed at certain points throughout. The film speaks to me and it feels complete in its currency-- tuppence, if you will-- in taking Mrs. Travers' story and embellishing it with the truth of the creators' (both Travers and Disney, for the part he has in the creation of the film) lives. The lives of the characters-- and I do mean most people seen on screen, in particular the driver and Mrs. Travers' mother-- are well-told and well-lived, and spark a certain comfort and warmth, even in the cold of their realities and harsher backstories. I believe the film has done its job beautifully, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Even the animated penguins, although for me there is still my deep and abiding love for their real counterparts.

Walt Disney was nothing like the man Tom Hanks portrays in this movie.

Disney was an American icon, whose studio and theme parks have played significant roles in American pop culture. However, Disney was an enigmatic man unlike anything shown in this movie. Disney was far from the beloved, grandfatherly executive Hanks plays on screen. In fact, Disney was known to be a difficult and sometimes unpleasant man who paid low wages and worked his animators to exhaustion. In short, life in the Disney creative offices was not the great big party depicted in Saving Mr. Banks.

I understand it's a family movie, and clearly most people have enjoyed the show. But I have trouble getting on board something that plays very loose with how things really went down.

If anyone wants to know the TRUE story of P.L. Travers' and Walt Disney's negotiations regarding MARY POPPINS, read Caitlin Flanagan's article "Becoming Mary Poppins" published in The New Yorker in 2005. Walt Disney was an S.O.B., and treated Travers abominably. Obviously the company is trying to soften his image with this insipid film. I've lost all respect for anyone involved with the project.

This paragraph from Flanagan's piece says it all: "The première was the first Travers had seen of the movie-she did not initially receive an invitation, but had embarrassed a Disney executive into extending one-and it was a shock. Afterward, as Richard Sherman recalled, she tracked down Disney at the after-party, which was held in a giant white tent in the parking lot adjoining the Chinese Theatre. "Well," she said loudly. "The first thing that has to go is the animation sequence." Disney looked at her coolly. "Pamela," he replied, "the ship has sailed." And then he strode past her, toward a throng of well-wishers, and left her alone, an aging woman in a satin gown and evening gloves, who had travelled more than five thousand miles to attend a party where she was not wanted."

If you thought Nurse Ratched was bad, by the end of dealing with P.L. Travers, author of the MARY POPPINS books, Walt Disney would have probably preferred a frontal lobotomy. 

Although we know the beloved Julie Andrews musical will be made, there's enough suspense of whether Travers, played with an uncompromising, neurotic nitpicking by Emma Thompson, will sign over the rights, thus allowing... in her opinion... Walt Disney to make a cartoonish mockery of her literary work.

Flashbacks into her past show us the author's family in Australia, and eventually the influence of the Mary Poppins character

Scenes with her banker dad play out like dreamy (and often nightmarish) vignettes... And while providing a nice break from the linear story, these segments distract from the pivotal Travers verses Disney relationship... Ironically, during Tom Hanks' heartfelt soliloquies into Disney's own past, you'll forget there's anyone else in the room. 

Emma Thompson does a pretty good job but lacks the snappy charm to make an antagonistic character fun and/or completely interesting Then, when she does come around, it seems a bit too easy and contrived and yet, like Disney and his staff, you'll be glad the inevitable change occurred: her stubborn determination grows exaggeratedly one-dimensional and downright tiresome after awhile... 

Perhaps this was needed to make the contented Walt Disney struggle like a hungry artist instead of grinning like a jovial tycoon At first Tom Hanks seems like he's doing an imitation, but as stress piles on a much more genuine and resilient persona shines through. 

And don't leave the theater till after the first wave of credits: you'll hear tape of the real Travers laying down the law to the studio Which must have been a grueling adaptation process, yet for fans of the cinematic MARY POPPINS it was, like all things of the artworld, well worth someone else's struggle.

Another 'inspired by a true story' movie surefiring its way to this years Academy Awards, tells the story of the odd cat-fight between P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson), author of the famed Mary Poppins books, and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) en route to the production of the live action feature. After 20 years of constantly pressuring the author on selling her book to Disney, Travers finally reluctantly agrees given her financial plight. However, she stipulates the need for her to have control over the end product with script authority and veto power. This creates tension with the scriptwriter and the musicians (especially given Travers is reluctant to agree to any music at all). With this uneasy relationship slowly boiling over it seems like the picture is destined for failure. However, the experiences of the writer bring back painful memories of her youth, which give insight as to the origins of her beloved flying nanny.

The movie juxtaposes the prickly P.L. Travers with the overbearing optimism of Disney and the Californian sunshine. Watching Disney especially, presented as a jovial and considerate person, as opposed to the troubled Travers, managed to arouse my inner grumpiness, cheering on the Australian-born children author in her endeavour of being an full-fledged pain in the buttocks to the animation studio and her employees. Ultimately somewhat let down that Travers lets herself be corrupted by the twinkle toes of Hollywood, especially with the externally honest, internally two-faced Disney in mind. Thus, I must admit I failed to catch on to the rampaging mirthfulness of the movie, instead finding myself irritated by the positive light being shone on the American way of being, as contrasted to the straight-faced jabbing sardonicism of the foreigner.

Emma Thompson remains a shining light throughout, in thick or thin, in drama or comedy, delivering arguably the best and most complete performance of the year (regardless of sex). Beautifully layered thanks to her starkly English attitude as well as some very well intertwined flashbacks, much can be forgiven and forgotten. Nonetheless, when Disney slowly seems to be winning the fight for the heart, I found myself pulling back emotionally at the insincere American entirety of the movie. Especially given the presentation of Walt Disney in this movie is a far cry from reality, sugar-coating a man who deserves no such accolades. The internal conflict that drives the movie slowly irritates, with the only emotional impact owing to the sidelined back-story of P. L. Travers and exceptional acting by Thompson.

My family and I had high hopes for this movie. It is, after all, based upon the incredibly family friendly Mary Poppins Author's (PL Travers) life. Our hopes were dashed in a very disturbing manner.

**************************SPOILER ALERT******************************** It is almost impossible to write a review on just how awful this movie was without telling the TRUTH (i.e. a spoiler). The advertising and the trailers for this film were very deceptive. They painted a picture of a movie that was based upon hope, adventure and redemption. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT. The story is told, in numerous flashbacks to PL Travers' childhood, which is as dark, distorted and depressing as it gets.

At one point, Traver's dazed mother (stunned and shocked by her complete inability to pull her husband back from the brink of severe alcoholism, the flu and impending death), attempts suicide by almost drowning herself. PL Travers gets on the family horse and rides to the rescue, but the rescue is only a fleeting and pitiful flicker of hope for her tragic family. Travers' dad, who she apparently loved, dies a slow, painful, agonizing and incredibly undignified death.

I kept waiting for a miracle, or SOME SEMBLANCE of redemptive hope to enter the movie. It never happened. At the end of the movie, PL Travers has relented to Walt Disney's persuasion and sold the Mary Poppins movie rights. Travers goes to the premier in Hollywood with all the stars and she cries during the touching scenes, but when Walt tries to comfort her she denies the true reason for her profuse tears.

So Mary Poppins is finally turned into a movie after much hand wringing, manipulation and haughty, bitchy behavior from PL Travers. Everybody wins except PL Travers whose tragic childhood is never redeemed. She is the classic portrait of hopelessness. She is the poster child for a child who was hurt severely in her youth, internalized the pain, became a bitter person, and never recovered.

The movie is disturbing and hopeless. Again, I kept waiting for some Disney or Mary Poppins magic. Isn't that what Disney and Mary Poppins are all about??? The magic never came. The real people in this movie, Travers and Disney, made a profit and the masses were blessed with the character of Mary Poppins on the silver screen. But the heart of Mary Poppins, PL Travers herself, lived on in isolation because no one could stand the bitter old lady.

The movie does not depict it, but she died at 96 in London, after having lived a basically awful, lonely life. According to her grandchildren, "Travers died loving no one and with no one loving her." SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS MOVIE! This is not a family friendly movie. The interactions with Travers and her dad are incredibly disturbing and I kept waiting for him to molest her. Thank God it never got that far. This is a dark tale and I find the fact that so many people apparently loved it equally disturbing. This is a story of NON REDEMPTION. I would have rather watched "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" than to have spent my family's time on this garbage. I rate this as one star, one of the most hopeless movies I've seen, ever.

Beautifully ambitious and eagerly constructed, the success of Walt Disney Studios' homage to its heritage is anchored magnificently by the crowning work of Emma Thompson's career. John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks is a tenderly affectionate tale featuring one of the year's finest ensembles. Following a classic three act structure, when the film begins, it undoubtedly lifts off and hooks you almost immediately. Held back by a few poor choices in the editing room, there's no denying the glamour, chemistry, and witchery that the film sets on you. Saving Mr. Banks is feverishly delightful.

Written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, the film tells the story of P.L. Travers, the author of "Mary Poppins," who in the early 1960's met with Walt Disney and his creative team to decide whether to sign the rights of her beloved book to the magic studio. During the production, Travers reflects on her childhood and her relationship with her loving father, played by Colin Farrell, intertwining the magic of her beloved novel and the guilt of a troubled past.

As an unbridled, even at times downright vicious P.L. Travers, Thompson hasn't pursued and thrived in a character of such complexities since James Ivory directed her to an Oscar in Howard's End over twenty years ago. Travers' mannerisms and moral guidelines are captured charmingly by the creative team. Thompson and director Hancock clearly worked closely together to nail the nuance of the central character's focus. She buries herself in the time, and that of designer Daniel Orlandi's stunning costume work, to be the perfect entity of a fruitful tale. Playing the young Travers, Annie Rose Buckley is cute as a button and has some real juicy moments to sink her teeth into. Unfortunately, some directorial choices hinder any substantial connection between her and the audience to muster any real attention.

Marcel and Smith's script is pure gold. There is such a dynamic and balance of charming and witty comedy tied in with heart wrenching and polarizing drama. Their assembling of the movie era, capturing subtle inequities of the business, and painting a magical story, will likely stand as one of the screenplays of the year. There is a heavy yet almost invisible component of layered despondency that the two writers choose to include that make the film truly sing.

Upon hearing the casting of Tom Hanks as the iconic Walt Disney, I have to admit my reservations were at an all-time high. Hanks, who has excelled in his career playing the everyday man, and floored the bulk of America with his performance in Captain Phillips this year, absolutely nails his role as the film executive tycoon. His choices of character beats, that don't put down the material nor distract the audience from the story being told, is spot on nearly every moment. He maneuvers his way with his charisma but allows the animosity to fester in the viewer. I was thoroughly impressed.

Where the film missteps greatly is in the direction and options that John Lee Hancock chooses to execute throughout. "Banks" essentially tells two stories. One of the present time during the production of "Mary Poppins" and the other of P.L. Travers' childhood. Hancock chooses to tell these two stories simultaneously, awkwardly transitioning from one time period to the other, and ripping us away from the story we're desperately invested in. In many ways, his direction will be seen in the same reactionary split of Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. There will be some, likely many, that will have no problem with his bumbling alterations in certain scenes and there will be some, like myself, that sees that he's still has a long way to go. Not gunning him down as a complete disaster, he has about three instances where the potential and vision are clearly realized. Hancock knows how to tug at the heartstrings. When a scene works, he accomplishes it with the utmost confidence and brilliant demeanor. A tightly paced and pivotal scene involving the song "A British Bank" showcases Hancock's best varieties, and also that of co-star Colin Farrell.

For my dollar, everything connects and rises during the creation of "Let's Go and Fly a Kite." The cast comes together and unifies in such a harmonious fashion and Hancock chooses to utilize all the supporting players including that of the wonderful Bradley Whitford, the witty BJ Novak, and in his best turn yet, Jason Schwartzman. Hancock operates these three men in an ingenious method. Paul Giamatti is a compassionate force, especially in his exchanges with Thompson while Ruth Wilson makes me absolutely adore the ground in which she walks.

Besides the dynamite work of Thompson, I lived for the miraculous music of Academy Award nominated composer Thomas Newman. Brilliantly hinting at some of his other composed works, everything about the music in Saving Mr. Banks purely resonates because of Newman's continued abilities to insert his own personality into his work. You can't find another film musician this aware of his talents and continued drive to elevate his own material. It's the Oscar slam dunk we've been waiting for in Original Score.

There have been complaints about this film on the basis of historically inaccuracies ranging from the dialogue between Disney and Mrs. Travers, the relationship between Mrs. Travers and the studio to the simple motif of Mrs. Travers dancing with the writers. This film is not an historical document, rather a story about an author, her book and a studio. The film portrays the Mary Poppins books as an attempt by Mrs. Travers to rescue a version of her father and give him a better story than life provided him, a point made touchingly by her bursting into tears in- front of the writing staff due to her perception that they had made Mr.Banks 'unspeakably awful'. The writers return the following day with a changed ending, one where father went kite flying with the kids and they were together as a family. Abstracted from the history of events, this film is a charming depiction of two people with difficult childhoods forming an uneasy friendship through a tortuous collaboration. In reality, Mrs. Travers never did let go of her father or her books and had a poor relationship with the family that survived her; what sense of hope or satisfaction would an audience derive from such an ending? I would like to think that this isn't weakness or evasion, but Disney's way of trying to give the relationship between itself and Mrs. Travers the parity and respect in film that it deserved to have in life.

Saving Mr. Banks is one of those films that commits the fateful cinema sin of producing exactly what you expect from it and is therefore entirely and utterly predictable from the film's start until it's signposted ending. What makes Hancock's film a true misfire however is that this predictable journey is centred around one of the most horrendous and unlikeable leading ladies (we are talking Nurse Ratchet like unlikeable here) I've been unlucky enough to witness and no matter where her life resolution takes us it's mighty hard to care.

There were quite a few pundits within the movie industry that bemoaned the fact British actress Emma Thompson missed out on being nominated for an Oscar for her work here, but all I can say is thank goodness for common sense prevailing. Thompson's role as cantankerous and razor tongued author P.L Travers may be close to the real life thing but it doesn't enhance the fact all Thompson had to do was look sour, be ungrateful and generally be rude to everyone and anything, an acting feat that can't be overly hard to pull off. Surrounded by solid support everywhere you look, Travers overshadows all other players thanks to her cancerous hatred towards most things in her life and it is supposed to be OK because she has daddy issues? That is also where Saving Mr. Banks fails.

Giving audiences an inside look into the authors troubled childhood in Australia is a nice touch but the way in which it is structured, through flashbacks featuring a questionably acting Colin Farrell and later on Australia's very own (cantankerous and rude in real life) actor Rachel Griffiths, is a play by the filmmakers that feels gimmicky and misused. It's clear that Traver's childhood wasn't a fairy tale but it's also clear that it doesn't give her an excuse to be the lady she was and doesn't justify a life of frequent rudeness. The film does succeed in showing us again why Mary Poppins is such a fine cinematic classic with raucous rendition of songs a highlight, and it's nice to see Hanks enjoying himself as Mr. Disney but you wouldn't say it's one of his crowning achievements.

Filmed with an overall air of TV movie quality and with a script that often fails to justify a reason for us to be spending such a large portion of our time with a sour old lady, Saving Mr. Banks greatest achievement is making the audience wish they were watching Mary Poppins instead; a film filled with wonder, joy, characters we care for and a sense of originality which is virtually all the things Saving Mr. Banks doesn't have.

"Savings Mr. Banks" is worth seeing for Emma Thompson's peerless performance as "Mary Poppins" author PL Travers. That Thompson was not nominated for a best actor Academy Award is a crime. Thompson's performance is one of the most compelling and convincing performances I've ever seen. 

Thompson plays PL Travers as a witch, and I'm using the nice version of the word. You know what word I really mean. Thompson's Travers is thoroughly believable. This isn't a cartoon villainess. This isn't Cruella DaVille or Maleficent. This is a woman you could imagine having as a boss or a neighbor. You'd do everything you could to avoid her. She doesn't learn any lesson. She doesn't reveal that we are all warm and fuzzy if you just get close enough.

Some have criticized "Saving Mr. Banks" for this reason. They say that it's sexist to depict a successful woman author as being a witch. Baloney. It would be sexist to depict her as warm and cuddly. Women can be unpleasant. I know plenty of women like Travers. It isn't liberated to insist that all women are nice. Plenty of women are not nice at all. 

I found Thompson's depiction of Travers to be so powerful that the rest of the film didn't measure up, for me. Part of the film takes place in 1961. Travers is in Hollywood, working with Disney studios on their film adaptation of her book "Mary Poppins." Part of the film is a series of flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. In the flashbacks, Colin Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic father. The flashbacks didn't work for me. They had the feel of an afterschool special. Everyone was so good looking, especially Colin Farrell, even while suffering the health effects of alcoholism. Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the author as a child, is cherubically beautiful. The scenes depicting the alcoholic father disappointing and humiliating his daughter, and breaking her heart, did not affect me at all. They felt paint-by-numbers  oh, this is the predictable scene where the little girl realizes her father is a loser. 

The 1961 scenes in Hollywood worked much better. Paul Giamatti is amazing in the small part of Travers' limo driver. He brings a wallop of humanity and poignancy to his role that really swept me off my feet. The two develop a real rapport, and they could have taken up much more of the film. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are also brilliant as Robert and Richard Sherman, who wrote the songs for Mary Poppins. In one scene, Travers objects to Robert Sherman's walking with a cane. The film doesn't mention this; I wish it had. Sherman was only 19 or 20 years old when he participated in the liberation of Dachau. He was shot during the war. That's why he walked with a cane. 

Tom Hanks as Walt Disney didn't really work for me. Walt Disney was a totemic figure from my childhood. I remember him, in his TV appearances, as rather godlike  avuncular and yet distant, impenetrable. While watching Emma Thompson as PL Travers, I got the sense that I was watching something like the real PL Travers  a real, complex, human being. While watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I got the sense that I was watching Tom Hanks play a sanitized version of Walt Disney. "Saving Mr. Banks" was very brave in its depiction of Travers, but very vanilla in its depiction of Walt. Giamatti as the fictional limo driver had more depth and complexity. 

The movie is most valuable as a character piece. It tries to say some big things about how people live through sorrow, like Travers' childhood, and survive that sorrow by creating art about it, like "Mary Poppins." That big idea really didn't wash for me. I know it's possibly true, but that message just didn't grab me, so the movie was not a ten, but it's certainly worth viewing for Thompson's performance, for her interplay with Giamatti and the Sherman brothers as played by Schwartzman and Novak.

The truth, a little of the truth, so far from the truth. I read the original novels, and they are indeed pretty far from the Disney Treatment (capitals are in order) they got; yet, I really love the movie (Mary Poppins, that is), but I can also see why Mrs. Travers loathed it. And I read about the real encounter between Walt Disney (a way more unpleasant person than pictured here) and Mrs. Travers, and once again, this is its Disney Treatment. Once again, I liked the movie, a lot; yet once again I see where someone could loathe it. The Disney Treatment is responsible of the popularization of many famous or obscure tales (as an Italian, I'm thinking of Pinocchio); and, at the very same time, it is responsible for their massacre in an orgy of sugary coating. That Pamela Travers had to suffer this twice, is way too cruel. Summing it up: 9 to the movie per se, 5 to the Disney Treatment of reality.

Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson...how can it miss?

It did.

Performances were first rate, especially Ms. Thompson. How CAN that woman play such a frumpy and unpleasant character and still be so beautiful and desirable? The woman is an artist. That wasn't the problem. Hanks was adequate and nothing more.

The story spent WAY too much time on the deeply depressing relationship between Ms. Travers and her father and WAY too little time on the relationship between her, Disney, and Disney's team. The movie is frankly a downer, BIG time.

I can't recommend it. Sensitive people and those prone to depression NEED to avoid it.

Once again BIG American STUDIO CRANKS UP THE MONEY MACHINE TO GENERATE REVENUE RATHER THAN TELL A TRUTHFUL STORY! This is crap. Nothing redeeming about it. Sad to see a huge talent like Emma Thompson wound up in this project. I hope she saw this coming after signing the contract, she portrays an immensely shallow and hateful character, beyond realistic acceptability and her performance seems to be pushed in to just going through the motions to collect the cheque. Tom Hanks on the other hand has a track record of being involved with movies that are more interested in generating revenue than delivering a truthful story based on the drama of real life.

The script takes the objections way too far. In pure business, movie making or not, it is implausible to believe that if this story was anything close to true as portrayed a true business person would put up with the garbage that went on. They would have cut their losses and moved on to the next project.

Skip this movie, it's so unbelievable it's beyond junk. I adore Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in their rolls in the original movie so seeing a glimpse of them again towards the end in the final production was a treasure. But a few seconds of this did not make up for the rest of the movie.

Saving Mr. Banks, about the dynamics behind the making of the film Mary Poppins, is Hollywood at its best: people with hardships in their past overcome them through their collaborative art; something creative, sweet, perhaps syrupy, but always honest, and with integrity. 

It was a wonderful choice to pick the co-author and consummate actress of Nanny McPhee, Emma Thompson, for the role of Travers. 

We see the hardships in Walt's own past, that of Mrs. Travers, and a couple of other key characters: one of the song writers injured in the war, and the limo chauffeur who loves his handicapped daughter (this film's unseen Tiny Tim). And all of these Snow White Dwarf characters, innocent and childlike, except Mrs. Travers, carry this syrupy hope and optimism. The same that her father carried...which may have led to his death. Or was it the one thing carrying him as long as it could? In grief over losing him, she has written a beautiful book, but herself become a living Ebenezer Scrooge.

In this American version of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", Walt Disney is the living Ghost of Christmas Present. 

Walt reveals that he knows the perfunctory and scrooge practicality of Mrs. Travers belies such dreamy hopes she herself carries, and always has since childhood, writing about a magical savior nanny who flies in on the wind and an umbrella. Walt later discovers Mary Poppins is all about her lost relationship with her deeply beloved father, and Walt works subtly to reconnect her to the very childlike nature of her father whose death she has still not come to terms with. He tells her that this film, Mary Poppins, will be a way for her to come to terms with honor.

Mrs. Travers discovers that Disney is indeed integrating these truths seamlessly, and has done so all along. We are all children, after all, and our happiness depends upon remembering and honoring that. 

He is far from fluff. There is more gravitas in that ride on the merry go round than Mrs. Travers understands at the time. 

And then she realizes that everyone on this project, even the secretary bringing a feast of syrupy and colorful sweets every day into the office, everyone who works for Disney is in the same boat she is, finding meaning and expression by turning personal difficulty into a positive creation. And that self-knowledge, that personal wisdom makes the folks at Disney able to accomplish miracles while showing remarkable tolerance and encouragement to each other. 

Disney was not all slapstick cartoons, talking animals and smiles. A year before releasing Mary Poppins, in 1963, Disney released The Three Lives of Tomasina, a film that touches on death, mysticism, spirituality, re- birth and the love between father and daughter that in grief can become a neurosis. Disney always had deeper intent and content. Same with Darby o'Gill released by Disney in 1959. Even Bambi and Dumbo, dealing with abandonment, death, and the difficulties of grief and separation, the emotional wounds of being orphaned. And 20,000 leagues Under the Sea in 1954. The portrayal of a genius captain's murderous rampage; self- destructive insanity and his obsession with his lost wife honored Edgar Allen Poe as much or more than Jules Verne. These films are nothing close to Mrs. Travers' prejudice about Mr. Disney's work. It was Mrs. Travers' superficial view that was mistaken. And that was the product of her own self- denial.

Mrs. Travers, while watching Mary Poppins, cries at points, but she also still cringes at others. She is still Mrs. Travers. We see the genius of Disney: his work reflects the best of very different professionals, and a deeper spirituality. 

Hanks does a nice, layered job. He portrays Disney the savvy business leader and manager. But there is still much more to tell. 

An entire film could be made of Walt's role leading the way to the Monorail, an engineering feat unprecedented in America and only faintly recognized, for it remains too far ahead of its time. Walt had his own engineers at the Burbank studios design most of it, successfully, working with a basic concept from Sweden, fighting the clock to meet deadlines. He turned a concept into an actual reality through brilliant engineering and leadership. The first monorail in America. 

Walt was far more than a film maker. City planners today use Disneyland and Walt Disney World as a model for the ideal urban community. Walt didn't plan these places as theme parks. His entire vision was to use them as living models of ideal communities. Visiting either park was to be a subtle education, and has proved to be so.

One day that film will contrast Walt walking as an eight year old boy through the snow at his father's command with the adult Walt obsessed with innovations in public transportation, the ergonomics of technology, and the design of Utopian communities. 

Steve Jobs, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg all from California, are childhood students of and adult contributors to Disney's vision.

And of coarse, the better known struggles to get Snow White to screen, and Fantasia, both requiring incredible personal risks, technical genius, leadership, sentiment and teamwork. An entire motion picture could be made of either of these remarkable personal and professional journeys of achievement.

I will never forget, as a seven year old boy visiting the Monsanto Home of the Future at Disneyland in 1964, designed largely by Disney and his own crew of engineers. Sitting on the coffee table, without being mentioned by the tour guide, was a wireless picture phone in a small flat rectangular shape, probably three inches by five inches, looking just like today's smart phone. Spooky.

We are all still trying to live up to Walt's vision, each in our own way.

I was able to view an advanced screening of Saving Mr. Banks. I will have to rate it as an excellent movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it certainly brought back memories. I enjoyed it very much. The film was on the most part incredibly true to era. I felt the transitioning from one time period to the other was done smoothly and poignantly. Obtaining the screen rights for the making of Mary Poppins and the childhood of P.T. Travers are intricately woven. The entire point of the movie could not have been made without this aspect. It was brilliantly done. I see many Oscar nominations here. Tom Hanks was outstanding as always as well as Emma Thompson. Colin Farrell was remarkable. The interactions of all the characters was beyond well done.

At times this film will overwhelm you with its simple power and leave you sobbing uncontrollably as you grieve for a lost childhood and magical memories of an early film viewing experience. This is cinema for the soul of our past and it touches us deeply with its truth. Hanks and Thompson are nothing less than superb in their respective roles and undeniably do some of their finest work in this film. In every scene they play together, we are reminded of just what great actors they truly are. As we watch them bring the profound depth of their characters to life, we experience a journey into the past and a hope filled time that promised such a beautiful future. Marry Poppins was imperfect masterpiece and this film is as well. But the way both films touch our souls and as adults rekindle that faint glow of hope, well, it is quite sublime indeed. The question is asked somewhere on the IMDb, "Is it necessary to view Marry Poppins prior to seeing this film?" The answer is that no life is complete if the magic of Marry Poppins hasn't been part of it. If one's heart is touched by that film, then Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely treasure. If Marry Poppins is nothing more than a cinematic requirement that offers little more than catchy tunes, then simply don't bother. Unless you can open your heart and break through the calcified cynicism that prevents you from seeing the profound beauty in these two films, both can be easily dismissed as sentimental fluff. I feel blessed to have seen Mary Poppins as a young lad and realized what a gift it was at the time and what a golden memory it would be for the rest of my life.
