### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Precursor: I just moved back into town two days ago and had made plans to see one of my old friends tonight. I did not want to see this movie, and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really wanted to and the tickets were free so I went. 

Review itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy. 

But damn. 

I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichés seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies (Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.

All in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart. 

IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. 

Stoked for the sequel.

Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.

Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.

Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice  Cube talking to the duo.

The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.

21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.

The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.

The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.

All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it.

So if you like Jonah Hill and comedies with really great cameo appearances, I think you would definitely like this film.

I must admit I expected this to be at the same standard as maybe The Change-Up or The Hangover Part II which weren't terrible movies, but they weren't the funniest movies I have seen either. This movie is more on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and Anchorman.

The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or "rom" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn't even control my laughter in a full cinema.

All in all, I'm not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill's ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely recommend this one! Best comedy film I've seen at the cinema in 2012.

I have never seen the original 21 Jump Street series so I can't compare. I had only watched the trailer and thought it looked alright, but wasn't planning on paying to see it. I received free advance screening passes to see it last night and I am so glad! It is honestly the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I usually don't laugh out loud but this movie had me (and the rest of the audience) laughing at least every ten seconds.

Who knew Channing Tatum could be so funny? He really steals the show half the movie with his great comedic timing. The back-and-forth that he and Jonah Hill have is so refreshing. They have clear comedic chemistry and play off of each other very well. The dialogue is fresh and hilarious. Another standout actor was Dave Franco. I am a big fan of him and have always found him funny, and he really shines in this movie. Overall, every actor played off the next very well. It's clear they had a great time making this movie.

I can't recommend this enough. If you want a good laugh, then SEE THIS. It has clever, outrageous comedy and some great acting. There was a great cameo surprise towards the end that had the entire theater gasping and laughing. This is one of the few movie experiences I've had where the entire audience enjoyed themselves and laughed out loud, even clapped at some parts. Go see it, you will not regret it!

21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper: a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise, akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation, and it isn't just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action-comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as Schmidt and Jenko respectively, two rookie cops who went to high school together, though belonging to different social circles. Jenko was the popular jock while Schmidt was the unpopular nerd. When they realize each has something the other one needs, a friendship sparks and they become partners. After a failed drug bust, they're reassigned to a special division when their police station decides to "revive a cancelled program from the 80s" (get it?). They're sent to a local high school undercover as students to investigate and bring down a drug ring. Despite identical titles, I don't know if we can even call this an adaptation of the show. While the TV show was primarily a drama, the film is essentially a satire of movies and shows like 21 Jump Street, fully aware of all of the clichés of its genre. 

Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) seems to have realized nobody really cared about a 21 Jump Street movie and instead decided to make something totally different. Early on, in a scene of dialogue that may as well have been delivered directly into the camera, a character explains that there aren't any original ideas these days and so we're stuck rehashing old concepts from the 80s to make a quick buck. In this way and many others, the movie is all about subverting your expectations, which based on this premise are probably very low. It's anything but a lazy cash grab, taking everything you know about buddy cop films and turning it on its head. It embraces the stupidity of its concept too, by constantly acknowledging that Hill and Tatum are way too old to be posing as high school kids, or by having Ice Cube play the stereotypical black police captain from every 80s movie ever, and then outright acknowledging that. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko's roles are reversed, with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock. 21 Jump Street thrives on the unexpected.

Many were initially unsure how Channing Tatum would perform, as he is an actor who has never headlined in any major comedies before. While Jonah Hill is without a doubt the star, having had tons of experience in films like Superbad and Knocked Up, Tatum does a fine job as well and the two actors have great chemistry together. In movies like this with two main leads, the rapport between them can make or break the film. With 21 Jump Street, it absolutely makes it.

That's ultimately why the movie works as well as it does. Any successful comedy needs real stakes. Otherwise, it just feels like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches with no real purpose. A few years ago, Superbad was extremely successful not just for being a goofy and raunchy comedy, but also for having a believable high school friendship at its core. Similarly, 21 Jump Street works because the friendship between its protagonists feels real, and as a result there are real emotional stakes to go along with the satire. Driving this silly, raunchy comedy is a truly interesting story about popularity and friendship in high school, and about how you might act differently if you could go back as an adult. It's easily the funniest comedy in well over a year, but it's not just a vehicle for jokes: 21 Jump Street tells a great story, too.

Phil Lord and Chris Miller seem to love surprising us. As with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street is a movie nobody expected to be great. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it knows all of your complaints ahead of time. Think it sounds like a cheap cash crab based on an 80s property? They make a joke about that. Think Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are too old to play high school kids? They make a joke about that too. It's extremely clever and always two steps ahead of the audience. But what really stands out about 21 Jump Street is that it's not just an enjoyable and hilarious time at the theater, it also tells a genuinely interesting and emotionally compelling story, developing its characters in a way you probably wouldn't anticipate from a raunchy high school comedy.

The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.

I'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.

The direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.

All turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year.

Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.

For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.

The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.

While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.

No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.

Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.

Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by. At this point, America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days, that a mediocre exercise such as this, is hailed as a comic masterpiece!

I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show - doesn't sound all that appealing.

Hill's "The Sitter", completely mediocre, and it's been quite a while since Superbads success. 

Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL. I was still hesitant.

But, I stand corrected.

This is the funniest movie since last years' Bridesmaids.

The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn't rocket-science, and we knew it wouldn't be, but the comedic timing of the leads is spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.

I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred. One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The film hadn't used any of those gimmicks and didn't need to in the end. It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.

The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012 top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.

Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).

Nice surprise.

Deserves it's ranking here.

Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I'm rounding to 8.

You'll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually a clear notch above all of those films.

This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. 

The jokes try to hard to be hip and end up being just plays on stereotypes. For example, in a misguided attempt to look cool one of the characters punches a guy for being nerdy. The victim mistakenly believes he was punched because he is black and gay which makes the cop look uncool. In another example, throughout the movie the head of the jump street program acts like a stereotypical bad tempered black cop, even calling himself that. It is vaguely amusing the first time, but the next umpteen times it gets a little lame as do the frequent jokes about the guys not looking like teenagers. The visual and verbal humor are like this through the whole movie. 

The movie portrays alcohol and drug use as a funny joke. It shows scenes of the cops high on the supposedly deadly drug they are supposed to be in high school stopping. It shows them buying booze for an underage party and it's supposed to be funny because they have to use false IDs. It shows them stealing marijuana from the evidence lockup to share with the kids. I know it's a comedy not a message movie, but this is just not funny. To top it off, they don't even get reprimanded for any of the illegal things they do from giving drugs to minor to engaging in a high speed chase on a freeway, to reckless discharge of firearms, to taking further police actions when technically fired. 

The action is boring. The interminably long scenes of bicycle, car, and limousine chases do not even begin to liven up this bomb. They are not interesting. 

The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops. 

I used to watch the 21 Jump Street series and it was a serious drama about serious issues like homosexual bullying, drugs, suicide, and peer pressure. It may have been a little soap operish at times, but it was dramatic and interesting. I think it deserved more respect than this.

The movie version of "21 Jump Street" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it's funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.

I thought the movie was going to show how two older, wiser guys go back to high school as undercover cops, and show those young kids what's up. THAT would have been interesting. Instead, they go right back to how they were as kids, bumbling and fumbling their way along, and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.

The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.

The original 21 Jump Street with Johnny Depp was a good show. The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb, sorry.

This is easily Tatum's worst film, and I can't stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny, just annoying, and it makes sense that he co-wrote the script.

You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like, so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes, along with the usual drug and sexual comments, which take no imagination or creativity at all.

Big time bomb.

Just saw this with a friend. Saw the trailer, and thought that it looked a bit pointless, but gave it a chance anyway. The two main characters didn't have any chemistry, if you ask me. Nothing in the movie was realistic. It's annoying to see a movie with cops, who is that stupid. Ice Cube can't be taken seriously as a boss in a police stationen, with a street gangster attitude. If you like the series, don't watch this, something will happen that ruins the old classic, just avoid. I really don't get why so many people like this, maybe someone just voted 9-10, to trick others. If this is the future for other movies, I'm just watching my old movies again, gladly. Me and my friend don't agree on every movie, but we both think this was the worst this year. On to the next....

I'll make this short and sweet as I'm not even sure IMDb will allow me to post a review of what may be seen as a minority opinion.

Aside from being overall a waste of time and not funny, what really disgusted me is there are a ton of crude gay oral sex references in this film. Literally, it's as if the writers were paid on a 100% commission to insert as many explicit and implicit gay oral jokes or innuendo into the film as possible. The film projects the image that virtually most of the characters in the film harbor gay urges. I've noticed this self deprecating punch line is being inserted into quite a bit of comedies. 

Spoilers: The scene towards the end where the one character has his privates shot off and then has to pick it up with his mouth because he is handcuffed is revolting, disgusting, not funny and should have never made it past the censors. In an earlier scene a character makes a crack about forcing another to wear a snorkel mask and that they will then defecate into it. This is not funny, it's disgusting and sophomoric at best. 

In closing, Hollywood please stop with the disgusting bathroom humor and the relentless gay agenda. Also, knock it off with the fake reviews on here, there's no way this piece of garbage is a 7.6, me personally i would give it zero stars if i could,but i would bet without the fake reviews this would rate a 4.0 Same with that sleep inducing garbage from last year: "Drive".

On the surface, this movie looks like it would be somewhat mediocre. But it's actually pretty damn good. When you're not laughing your pants off (and believe me, you will be), you'll have no problem being just plain entertained by it's ability to just have fun. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant cliché's, but making fun of them in the process. Jonah Hill will have you laughing, and Channing Tatum actually did a good job in this movie.......not surprising seeing that the role called for him to be a douche bag. Which once again, is something to chuckle about. Towards the end, the movie does tend to drag on, but has no problem pulling you right back into it's fun. As far as comedies go, this is a pretty good way to start off 2012

I liked the original show. I knew that this movie wouldn't be as good. I wasn't prepared for how horrible it was. If I had my own car with me I would have walked out. They took what was good about the show and threw it away. The movie is set in present day, over 20 years after the original show aired. It has Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go undercover in a school to stop the flow of a new type of drug.

The cops break every law there is. At one point they teabag a criminal. They also break into the evidence room and steal some weed, give alcohol to minors, and consume drugs. 

There were very few female characters, most didn't have names. The cast was almost completely white-washed. They used the word bitch way too often and I felt offended. Even the cameos from Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson Peete, and Peter DeLuise fell flat. 

I wish I had those two hours of my life back.

An honest review. I can't understand why there are certain people who constantly hype this movie on the IMDb and criticise other better movies. I guess they must be paid to do so. Certainly seems plausible since I've now watched this crapfest. How bad is it? Do you remember the abysmal Ben Stiller butchering of Starsky and Hutch from a while back. 21 Jump Street is worse than that. Hardly surprising given that it stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. I've only seen Tatum in one movie before and he was a wooden, dull, boring plank in that. He's no better in this. As a leading man he's even more of a charisma vacuum than Chris O'Donnell.

Still at least he's better than Jonah Hill. Superbad wasn't just the title of his breakthrough movie its a description of his entire career.

He's been doing the same schtick in everything he does and if it was rubbish the first time it stinks like month old festering garbage now.

To make it clear I'm a fan of gross out stupid comedy but not when its as stupid and badly-acted as this. Don't pay to see this. The good reviews are fake. You'll thank me for the warning.

The target audience for this one seems to be high school boys. The well deserved R rating presents a challenge to get them into the theater.

While comedy is subjective, and there are some laughs, the repeated foul language and shooting people isn't funny.

Jonah Hill won't get an award nomination for this performance. He puts on the same braces that Ben Stiller wore in "Something About Mary" a far better comedy. The overall average acting is exposed in a two minute cameo by one of the best actors of our time.

The end credit sequence is a total assault on the senses. No need to rush out to see this. It will be just as bad on DVD or cable shortly.

Ah, I love this film - somewhat hilarious and has exciting action scenes, amazing on-screen chemistry and genuine (b)romance. It's like the perfect blend of both action and comedy, with some minor dramatic scenes and little adds here and there. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, admittedly, are ace in this film. They're simply hilarious and they're a great team. One's a little bit of a dork, quite chubby and funny (Jonah Hill), and the other's "hot", apparently, and is slim, quite-built and rather tall....in comparison (Channing Tatum). 

21 Jump street is a laugh-a-minute thrill ride of an action-comedy that never fails, as it lives up to its expectations (if you've not seen it, you'll be left satisfied....and you may need to change your pants!)Better than most action-comedies out there and it has better stars too. They're great working together - almost as good a pair as Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. 

Overall, a very funny action-comedy with great stars and favourable moments. I wonder if the second one surpasses it. Thanks for reading.

21 Jump Street is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It is filled with pure and sincere laughs from start to finish, certainly one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time, mostly made brilliant with the terrific chemistry between leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, you could tell that they got along very well on the set and enjoyed working together. The movie was also quite heartwarming at times and the characters developed surprisingly well, those are two significant things that make a movie great, as we symphatize with the characters more, but comedies like this usually don't bother with it, I was very impressed that this movie did. Absoluteky hilarious and very enjoyable, I would highly recommend 21 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good comedy 

New police officers Schmidt and Jenko are sent on an investigation to a high school to find and catch a group of people involved in a drug ring occurring in the school.

After reading so many good reviews about this movie, I decided to check it out! I was really excited because everyone said it was hilarious. I was very disappointed from the beginning as all the funny scenes from the commercials that I had seen were in the first 2 mins of the movie. I will say, however, that the movie started off well and was quite funny, but once the two cops entered high school, it all went down hill! Most of the jokes were inappropriate and I'm not saying that inappropriate jokes aren't funny it's just that they were basically the same joke over and over again and it got old very quickly. The rest of the movie was rather slow and seemed to drag on in the middle and the end was just very predictable. Overall I would NOT recommend seeing this movie, unless you like wasting your money!

I did not see this movie in the theaters and now I can honestly say I am really glad I didn't. After watching the DVD, I am still trying to figure out what the appeal is of this film. Is it Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum..? It does not make sense.

But for Bruno Wang, the most glaring aspect of this film, the one that makes it tank for me, is the fact that the film centers around a couple of oddly opposite misfits who wind up working for an undercover unit of the police department to infiltrate a synthetic drug ring and stop the drugs from spreading from one high school to many in the community. So the logic here is that drugs are bad, right? However, the movie then proceeds to glamorize the drug (HFS-which stands for Holy F*ing Sh*t) and shows 60s Batman-like graphics of the different phases of the drug's effects. Even more twisted is that one of the students dies after taking HFS. This is supposed to be funny?

The movie is based on the TV series and the plot is weak. Two guys, now in their mid 20s, who were at opposite ends of the social spectrum in high school (one a jock and one a nerd), meet back up again in police academy training where they figure out that their strong traits can help each other overcome their weaknesses and get them to pass the academy. Jonah Hill plays the nerd, Schmidt and Channing Tatum plays the jock, Jenko. Jenko helps Schmidt with the physical part of the training and Schmidt helps Jenko with the bookwork. Together they succeed in passing the academy where they are immediately assigned as park cops riding bicycles. In the park, they witness drug usage and wind up capturing one of the criminals but neglect to read him his Miranda rights. The screw up has them being reassigned to an undercover crime unit, 21 Jump Street. They are chosen for this because they have 'youthful looks' and supposedly will fit into a high school unnoticed. 

The two wind up going back to their original high school posing as brothers and living in Schmidt's parents house. From here the movie is a strange mix of violence, drug humor and just bad plot. Schmidt and Jenko wind up accidentally trading identities while under the influence of HFS and now Jenko has to cut it with the nerds and Schmidt is hanging with the cool kids. The twist is that now the 'cool' kids are not the jocks, but the ones who are environmentalists and activists...and, in this case, also drug dealers.

Schmidt and Jenko are supposed to find the supplier of the drug before the drug spreads. After one massive failure after another they do eventually discover that it is the PE teacher, played by Rob Riggle. Riggle's role is the most unbelievable of all and really waters the film down. We have this half-cocked PE teacher who supposedly stumbles on to a formula for a synthetic drug and he now is supposedly dealing with underworld figures and guns etc.

Yes, there is a love interest, Schmidt is supposedly falling for one of the high school girls, Molly, who is in with the 'in' crowd in which Eric, played by Dave Franco. But again, here's a plot twist that is borderline sick, e.g., a 20 something guy hitting on a high school chick? 

There is also a cameo appearance by original 21 Jump Street DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise) near the end of the film. Sadly, this is one film that not even Johnny Depp can save. The whole film is just a disturbingly bad amount of really stupid humor and, pretty much, unbelievable plot line. It leaves you feeling a little numb and dumb. I give this movie a Bruno Wang 1.5 stars out of 5. The laughs are few and far between and the plot appears written by a thirteen year old.

I watched the REAL 21 Jump Street and this is no where close to being called the same thing. 21 Jump Street was clean for teenagers to watch. It gave good advice to kids. It brought up subjects that kids dealt with. They did blow up cars or destroy a city. This should not have been called 21 Jump Street. Another thing mostly everyone in the REAL 21 Jump Street looked sexy and young. Neither the two guys in this show even looked their age. They both looked fat, ugly, annoying and pathetic. Also Hanson and Duggy would not have been killed at the end of the movie. They wouldn't have been that pathetic to look away while apprehending criminals. I think if someone stupid says this is good they need to go back and watch the REAL 21 Jump Street then can talk. Hanson and Duggy brought down kids in school with class and dignity not destruction and degrading ways. Why must they say the F word thru the entire movie, every second. I mean come on. This could have been a better movie if they had actually watched 21 Jumpstreet. Also those kids they had in school does not fit how kids are now. Kids are not into the tree hugging crap or two straps. Nah I'm sorry this movie was a HUGE disappointment to society. Don't WATCH

I have never written a review before and I have no idea how to do this... Well, I'll start by saying that this movie took me several simultaneous laughs... Hilarious acting by Jonah Hill, good plot and nice jokes too! I got to stay i was not very satisfied with the performance of Channing Tatum as a high school student, but... Anyway, this is a good movie to watch on a Saturday night if you want to entertain and laugh. This film does not deserve a 10 because it is not perfect, there are some weaknesses in some parts, but, anyway, an 8 is very satisfactory. I recommend you to watch this film because I laugh a lot. Thank you for read my review and bye!!! PS: Sorry my English :/

Overall: This movie is fantastic and hilarious... on the first and second watch. I know this won't affect some people but for me it loses it's charm after the second or third viewing. Personally, I've watched this movie four times and own it on DVD. Hilarious on 1st and 2nd viewings but then drags on third and fourth one were I've wrote this review. Definitely watch it but can't say it's worth a DVD purchase.

Good: The movie is very funny on it's first few swings and can still get some laughs out of me now. The performances are stellar from Tatum to Hill and even up to Franco and Ice Cube. They all live their character and you can see they love what they were doing. Great cameos from the original show and the cinematography is great for the most part.

Bad: The plot overall, for me, is quite messy and tries helplessly to link characters and previous events together as in one giant loop. Some of the supporting cast were boring namely Molly, Dave's 'gang', the biker troupe and a few others. Music was mediocre at best at didn't fit at quite a few points. As stated above it loses its charm over time and just feels boring. Some editing and cuts feel a tad sloppy and fast but this is generally played for comedic effect and I doubt it would bother many people. If you want great action, don't watch this movie. The action scenes aren't cool, jaw dropping or otherwise interesting and if anything feels like the setup for the inevitable punch line. You can tell it was leaning far on the comedic side rather than action which is okay but I would have liked to see more effort.

Best Part: The final confrontation between Jonah and the main villain were he overcomes his fears and delivers a bad ass one-liner.

7/10 Best Part:

What do the movies "Jack and Jill" and "Batman and Robin" have in common? Two things. One, they are both considered to be some of the worst films to ever plague cinema. Two, they are both better than "21 Jump Street". "21 Jump Street" is a comedy film loosely based around a TV show running from the late 80s to the early 90s. While the TV show had heart and thought put into it, the film version disregards the original to throw in as much juvenile humor, stupid characters, unfunny jokes, and desperate attempts at comedy it has. 

The film starts off with our two main characters in high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is an awkward nerd while Jenko (Channing Tatum) is a jock who picks on Schmidt. Cut to a few years later where both of them are in the police academy and discover that their weaknesses are the other one's strength. A relationship forms between the two based around the fact that the two are using each other and we skip past the building of their friendship in a montage of Schmidt helping Jenko in the academic field while Jenko helps Schmidt in the physical field. The montage brings us to their graduation where they are welcomed into the police force and they are now good friends because of events we never witness. They are placed on park patrol and come across a group of drug dealers. They capture one of them but due to incompetence, the police have to let the dealer go and Schmidt and Jenko are reassigned to an old police program located at 21 Jump Street.

At 21 Jump Street, the two meet Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who reveals to them that they have been chosen because of their youthful appearance, and from what earlier scenes tell the audience because they are incompetent. The duo are sent into a high school to investigate a drug ring where they get their identities mixed up and have to go to the other one's classes. Schmidt is put into a drama class where he meets a girl named Molly (Brie Larson) and later becomes friends with a popular kid named Eric (Dave Franco). As the mission continues, Schmidt becomes more interested in being popular and being in high school than he does on cracking down on the drug dealers, which in turn causes a split between him and Jenko.

The characters of Schmidt and Jenko are the overall largest problem with the movie. They are unfunny, unlikable, and they are incompetent. All we know about their relationship is the fact that they became friends based around the fact that they were using each other, then we see a montage of them working together, and then they are suddenly best friends. To add insult to injury, there is no chemistry between the two. A problem with their characters is their arcs exist for lame jokes and that they make them look even more incompetent. Schmidt having trouble firing a weapon is a little acceptable but Jenko's inability to remember his Miranda Rights makes him look dumber and makes the police force look stupid to allow someone like that to stay on the force. I thought that at the end of the movie they would learn a few things and mature. What does the film do instead? Throw out a perfect opportunity for real and interesting character development in place for a stupid, unfunny, and disgusting penis joke.

The humor in this movie is at the lowest form of comedy and it is all desperate. Ellie Kemper, who is funny on "The Office" as Erin, portrayed Jenko's chemistry teacher and was only around for a cheap joke about how she was attracted to Jenko who was supposedly a student. One thing that really bugs me is that some of the comedic moments in this movie are things I would normally find funny, but this film takes what I like and turns it into another annoyance for me. Unfunny and just plain desperate for laughs, "21 Jump Street" sinks to use some of the most juvenile humor I have ever witnessed. How come Adam Sandler and his movies are criticized for having juvenile humor but then this movie gets appraise from critics and the general audience?

Of all the movies I have seen, this is the one that I regret watching the most. Watching this film was a depressing and aggravating experience that did nothing but make me lose trust in my friend's opinions who suggested this movie to me. Horrible, unfunny, unlikable, stupid, and obnoxious characters, a story that makes the audience route for incompetence, completed with an overall horrible script and unfunny jokes, "21 Jump Street" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it does nothing but causes me anger. While the late and great Roger Ebert said this about another movie, it applies to me here, "I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it." (Roger Ebert, "North" review). There are not enough negative words in the world to describe what this piece of garbage is.

"21 Jump Street" is an American 105-minute film from 2012, so it will have its 5th anniversary next year. The directors are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, not yet Emmy nominees at that time and the writer is Michael Bacall. He collaborated on the screenplay with Oscar nominee Jonah Hill and Hill is of course also a lead actor here. His co-lead is Channing Tatum and if you hear "21 Jump Street", then maybe you will think of the Johnny Depp television show right away. Depp is also one of the stars of the original series, who have a brief cameo in here. But back to the protagonists. We have Schmidt and Jenko who went to school together and one of them was the kid nobody liked and the other the kid everybody liked. And even if they weren't friends at all, they ended up as colleague in the same profession. They work as police officers and the time they spent together turned them into friends over the years. But sadly, they are as incompetent as it gets. This incompetence (and their youthful) resulted in them being transferred to another department where they are instructed to go undercover after a student dies from a new drug. They pose as students for pretty much the entire film afterward and not only their friendship is tested, but also their (in)competence.

I think this was a pretty decent watch. Most of the comedy worked well just like the character relationships and also the moments of drama, which weren't that serious admittedly. It's all about the comedy and the protagonists' relationship. Dave Franco (James' brother) and Oscar winner Brie Larson play major parts as well as students going to high school with our two heroes. Nick Offerman (P&R) and Jake Johnson (New Girl) give one scene performances while Ice Cube shows up more frequently as the guy (pissed at) being in charge of the two chaotic guys. But in the end all turns out well. This is not a film you would watch if you are in for some realistic and convincing story or some great depth, but if you are just in the mood for a fairly pointless, but fun little movie. Hill and Tatum do what they have to do and I can see how the film received good reactions by most audiences. It was successful enough for a(n equally appreciated) sequel that came out two years later and maybe there will even be a third movie at some point. I personally would not say that I liked this movie enough to immediately want to see the second, but I still give it a thumbs-up and recommend the watch. Finally, I want to tell you guys about one of my favorite scenes that showed how the film is pretty classy. In a more serious moment, Hill's character asks Tatum's that things will not again be the way they were back then and everybody would expect things to actually become that way indeed, but the filmmakers took the creative path of making Hill's character the way Tatum's was back then and the other way around. It is truly a well-crafted film and you should see it. Very entertaining and this means something coming from somebody like myself who definitely isn't the greatest Jonah Hill fan.
