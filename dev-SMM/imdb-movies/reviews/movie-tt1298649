### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
First off, don't read other reviews about this, it will ruin the unexpected plot and you will probably go in with a negative view. Somebody else said that this isn't a cinematic masterpiece and that's pretty much what i agree with, but it wasn't meant to be, it had some refreshing dialogue that wasn't so much punchlines, but funny conversations,the whole movie itself was just funny in general, the plot was ridiculous but at the same time it was really funny because it was just a big joke. The same people who rate this movie down are the same people who go rate down Schwarzenegger films because they have a silly plot, it's not about the plot, it's about hardcore action and silly punchlines, just like this movie is about funny conversations and a fun plot.

I see a lot of people bashing this film for some reason. Sure it's not some cinematic masterpiece; when I went to see it I wasn't expecting that. "The Watch" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen. Like a delicious onion the film does a good job peeling away at the story. Yes, it is not hard see the plot coming, but it's how the characters deal with the situations they encounter, that makes the film entertaining. Crybaby critics with their stuck up trendy smugness, "See, told you the plot was predictable.." Wow, way to over dramatize the obvious, you're so clever. I bet that "Titanic" ending took you by surprise? For all those critics who whine and cry about "The Watch" maybe they should just stay home and watch one of their Disney classics on VHS. This is a great film to see, escape the chaotic world and have a few laughs.

For me, this movie is a clear sign that some film-makers still care about making a good comedy. The movie is not just simple, cheap, predictable laughs, it actually is being one that relies on its story development and character buildup.

No, I'm not saying that this is a very clever or brilliantly written and made movie but I definitely prefer the approach of this movie above that of the average and more standard modern comedy. This is being a somewhat more subtle movie with all of its comedy and how it got incorporated into the movie.

Thing that made this movie especially great and fun to watch for me were its characters. The movie truly is mostly about its characters and their interactions with each other. All of the actors play quite well off each other and manage to give their characters some distinctive and enjoyable personalities. Really, without the movie its characters and actors portraying them, this would had most likely been a terribly weak movie.

It's true that most of the actors are playing the same type of characters they often play. Ben Stiller again plays a normal guy, who gets caught up in a crazy situation and Vince Vaughn basically is being a big man-child again. But somehow it all works out quite well and entertaining for the movie and I even dare to say that some of the biggest Stiller and/or Vaughn haters still could get some enjoyment out of this movie and not feel annoyed by their performances and characters. 

It's hard not to really spoil this movie but it's about something way more than just about a neighborhood watch, with a bunch of misfits in it. There are some interesting and unexpected developments in this movie, at least when you haven't heard about them already. I won't say anything about it, since I feel that it's more fun to just go into this movie, without knowing what is going to happen in it. So I advice you to also stay away from any trailers and just let this movie surprise you.

I simply had a good time watching this movie!

I have never claimed to be a screenwriter (nor would I even try to), but it seems to me that if "The Watch" had just been about a group of goofy, inept, over-the-top neighborhood watchmen, then it could have been a much tighter, coherent and interesting endeavor. 

Under the eye of director Akiva Schaffer ("Hot Rod") and penmanship of writers Jared Stern, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, however, the film is badly-managed and all over the map  thematically speaking. I use "writing" loosely, though, since much of the dialogue was ad-libbed by leads Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and the undisciplined approach certainly shows with these vulgar and stilted performances.

Adding murder, mutilation, orgies and an ill-conceived alien invasion just shows the desperation (and bloated budget) the cast and crew were forced to work with. Never has the phrase "less is more" been so sorely needed in a so-called comedic production.

Thus, the first pairing of Stiller and Vaughn since 2005′s "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is sadly wasted as the laughs come few and far between. And, when they do, they are usually overshadowed by following sequences of slaughter, mayhem and utter confusion that leaves both casual film patron and experienced movie critic scratching their collective heads in complete bewilderment.

The ludicrous plot has longtime Costco manager Evan (Stiller) grieving over the killing of a Mexican security guard in a most offensive and stereotypical scene. Starting a comedy with a vicious, bloody murder is hardly the best way to go, but that is just the beginning of this film's problems.

Appearing in front of a high school football audience (in one of the few really funny sequences), Evan makes an appeal for neighborhood watch recruits, but can only attract three weirdos  Bob (Vaughn), Franklin (Jonah Hill, fresh from "21 Jump Street" and an Oscar- nominated performance in "Moneyball") and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade)  who use the situation to get away from their wives and family members and look to get drunk and party.

The quartet is a joke (a really UNfunny joke, however), being ridiculed by smart-mouthed teens, random citizens and local law enforcement. When more murders take place, though, as well as the discovery of a forthcoming alien invasion, the group begins to suspect most everyone in the small Ohio town is involved (because, evidently, the invaders can also assume human form, any further plot explanation is really unnecessary at this point).

Along the way there are also several pointless subplots in "The Watch," one including Bob's slutty daughter, Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and her sexcapades, as well as Evan's low sperm count; neither of which is even remotely interesting or humorous. 

Lame supporting characters include Will Forte ("MacGruber") as the disbelieving town cop, and Rosemarie DeWitt ("Your Sister's Sister"), as Evan's non-descript wife. Then, the final conflict takes place at the Costco store and, like the rest of the enterprise is boring, confusing and nowhere near comedic at it needed to be.

And so "The Watch," the much-anticipated Stiller-Vaughn reunion (well, anticipated by SOME people, I suppose), falls flat on its face. The painfully humorless and obscene story, that meanders around like a rudderless alien spacecraft, makes this comedy one of the most disappointing and depressing adventures of the year.

Like most comedies starring Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and/or any of the Frat Pack, people are going to complain that this was gross, unfunny, ridiculous, etc. 

But they clearly expect too much from these guys. If you go into this movie thinking that you'll fall on the floor laughing then yes, you will disappointed. But I expected nothing and I laughed my butt off. It's a silly movie with a silly plot and it knows this. 

If you don't like Vince Vaughn or Ben Stiller, then don't see it. It's that simple. If you do like them, give it a try. I'll definitely watch it again because it was entertaining in the most over the top way.

This movie was a collection of actors seemingly in need of a paycheck; it is slow, largely unfunny and boring. There were few genuine laughs and I found myself straining to laugh at scenes that really weren't worth the effort. Ben Stiller plays the same character he has played a dozen times and I am struggling to remember a single funny line he issued. Vince Vaughn had a few funny moments, but again, he played the same character we've seen in all of his prior movies. And, Will Forte, he only has one character. At least he was irritating. Costco was funnier than any of these has-beens and never-weres. The plot was contrived and struggled to stay together throughout. I would have walked out but for Jonah Hill, who was genuinely funny and needs to stop carrying other people's movie's. Even with his moments of brilliance, I could not wait for the movie to be over. This will be the last Ben Stiller movie I will ever see.

This movie is just about unwatchable. Filled with high-school humor,long boring conversations and horrible acting with aliens in the mix.The only people who can find this funny are stoned high teenagers and kids that just learned a new word, DICK.

This is one of those direct to DVD mistakes. 

Let's face it, Ben is just not happening this days and poor Vince (a man with some talent)will be in the same boat if he keeps appearing in venues such﻿ as this.

Sitting in a theater with all of 12 people was a PAINFUL experience at best. The only bright spot in this trash pile was the sixty seconds that Lee Ermey was on screen.

My roommate asked me about the movie and i told him "Don't waste your TIME and hard-earned money!".

This film tells the story of a supermarket manager, who forms a neighbourhood watch after his employee was brutally killed in his supermarket.

"The Watch" is a light-hearted and fun rendition of a few unlikely heroes who save the world from alien invasion. The whole plot s so far fetched and ridiculous, that it means "The Watch" cannot be taken seriously. There is a metal ball capable of mass destruction, there is a super hunk that turns out to be more than he is, and the weak spot of the aliens is located in a particular area of the body. The dialog is juvenile and silly, but "The Watch" is all about brainless entertainment. If you treat it like a joke, you will have a lot of laughs.

I got about 20 minutes into this... this dreadful, tiresome, mind numbing, "comedy" and that was all I could take. I tried to find humour in Ben Stiller's performance but I'm sorry, I'm not 10 years old and don't do dope or take drugs of any kind. I just don't find Ben Stiller funny in any of his films though I bet there are any number of people behind the camera laughing at his every wide eyed attempt at ironic humour, his manager, his agent, his psychiatrist etc. Frankly, I don't think even he gets it. His idea of comedy died with the Three Stooges. Only Phil Silvers can carry off being Phil Silvers (even Steve Martin must be aware of that by now) know what I mean. Be original! The first rule of comedy is IT HAS TO BE FUNNY! It wasn't. I'd like to see Stiller in a dramatic gritty role for a change. I bet he'd make a great action actor with say Bruce Willis; he'd nail it. I have yet to see a subtle comic performance from him. Those eyes and expressions of his have been done to death. The only one who made me remotely smile was Richard Ayoade a man who through his hit UK sitcom The IT Crowd, which made the absurd brilliantly hysterical, has a genuine feel for absurd throw away dialogue. Jonah Hill can be very very funny and anarchic but in this he was miscast, sorry Jonah. Vince Vaughn "If-I-shout-loud-enough-it'll-be-funny" brand of comedy just annoyed me. It was insulting. They were all doing their own bit but none of them seemed to be relating to the others. Yes if that was the point, it didn't work. Anyone one of their characters in reality would have walked away from the others. Comedy comes out of real situations. None of that had any sense of reality about it. It was like a low budget remake of The Burbs (kind of) but without the class and black humour. My advice is don't watch it. Go and paint your car or knit yourself a suit of armour or something. You'd be better employed.

The nerve! I can't believe it look better on the page. Ben Stiller should know better by now. Or it's just a question of money. Not a moment of real comedy, not one. Vince Vaughn totally out of control in a non-character part. Oscar nominee Jonah Hill, lost. I felt hopeful when Billy Crudup makes his appearance, but the hope was very short lived. Random, inexplicable touches, that include explosions as a form of production value,I presume, but how embarrassing. The script is cheap and opportunistic but also misses its target, completely. Aliens in suburbia could have been a great idea. They needed writers and a director to execute it with some degree of oomph. Awful and depressing.

Turned it off after the first 30 minutes, during which I never so much as chuckled once but rolled my eyes plenty. The majority of the obviously intended comedic lines were either vulgar, sexual, immature or a combination of all three. If that's your thing, you might find this to be a funny movie, otherwise you're far more likely to be disgusted. The remainder of the attempted humor involved Vince Vaughn rambling on far, far too long in blatantly obvious ignorance to the task at hand. I know that's supposed to be the humor, but it just isn't. At all. And worse yet, it's just really annoying. 

I had higher hopes for Richard Ayoade, who was hilarious in the series IT Crowd, but the gratuitously vulgar and sexual references shoehorned into the dialog significantly detracted from my previous opinion of him. But here again, if you're taste in humor includes jokes about someone hoping to have their balls sucked, this is probably right up your alley. 

While I can't say that I've ever found Vince Vaughn's trademark (and only) character terribly funny, Ben Stiller can play a genuinely funny roll. Whether it's a career on the wain or just a bad plot/script, this is not one of Stiller's better performances. 

So again, YMMV, but I found this to be totally without any humor, and bordering on painful to watch. I'm less intelligent for having watched 30 minutes of this turd.

This movie was horribly unfunny! I almost fell asleep from all the boring dialogue and badly written script! Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill are now amongst the most unfunny and unoriginal funny guys of Hollywood! Which means at one point of their careers they actually were funny and original but now their out of touch! This movie is not as bad as Adam Sandler's movies that have been nothing but a crap fest lately but it is definitely up there! Don't expect this movie to be a box office hit but more like a movie that didn't need to be made especially with what went down in Florida and the Neighborhood watch! Which is why the name changed to begin with! You wonder sometimes how these movies even get made or how it passed the editing floor it's ridiculous!

It's got a great cast, an interesting setup, some hilarious dialogue  and space aliens. The Watch is stocked with immature humor, gross-out  gags and crass conversations as one would expect, but once the  otherworldly visitors appear, it simply doesn't gel. The concept of  defending against an extraterrestrial invasion has been successfully  merged with humor before (see Men in Black, Mars Attacks! and Attack  the Block), but here it feels like an afterthought, neither authentic  nor necessary in conveying a story of misfit buddies attempting to  protect their town. There are a few undeniably funny moments of  vulgarity styled after the laughs often found in the works of Jonah  Hill and Seth Rogen, but these segments feel misplaced in a film that  can't wrap itself around a sensible plot to showcase the comedy. 
Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) loves his town of Glenview, Ohio and is  deeply devoted to both the community and his job as the manager of the  local Costco. But when the night guard at his store is brutally  murdered, Evan determines to get even more involved and creates his own  "neighborhood watch" to help the undermanned police department track  down the killer. Recruiting Bob (Vince Vaughn), an overprotective  father who just wants to hang out with the guys, Franklin (Jonah Hill),  a trigger-happy maniac rejected by the police department for mental  instability, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a mild-mannered Brit with a  fantasy of rescuing lonely housewives, Evan attempts to lead his misfit  gang in search of clues. When the group uncovers the unearthly beings  behind the crime, they must band together to save not only their  beloved town, but also the whole world. 
The Watch is a confusing mess of genres, delving into comedy, horror  (with bloody violence and slimy monstrosities), drama, romance (of the  light-hearted kind), and action/adventure (bizarrely fixating on  slow-motion shootouts). At times, even when it's just comedic, it  switches between slapstick, situational, dialogue-driven,  teen-oriented, and raunchy. It never knows what it wants to be, partly  thanks to the shifting styles and perhaps mostly due to the current  events surrounding the real life Neighborhood Watch shooting in  Florida; a tragic incident and extremely unfortunate coincidence for  the marketing of this movie  forcing plenty of edits and the changing  of the title. Regardless of the controversial subject matter, the  unearthly direction The Watch chooses to go spells certain doom for the  effectiveness of the humor. Like a spoof of Invasion of the Body  Snatchers coupled with a cross between Men in Black and Old School,  there's simply no home for the vast range of unrelated settings,  characters, actions, and conversations (largely involving bodily fluids  as if preoccupied with duplicating the verbiage of Superbad  which is  not surprising considering scripting by Seth Rogen). 
Tackling the classic scenario of a common, quiet little suburb becoming  immersed in extraordinary occurrences (with a few central roles being  the only ones aware of the situation), The Watch borrows too heavily  from previously established filmic premises. What's worse is the  promising ensemble cast, which looks good on paper but results in  disinterest. Stiller is once again the straight man, insistent on doing  his job; Vaughn is the loud-mouthed instigator; and Hill is the kooky  oddball, spouting most of the off-the-wall comments and revealing his  life to be the least matured. Will Forte rounds out the group with an  amusing appearance as the stereotypical, incompetent, overconfident  cop. While themes of isolation, suspicion, control, reclaiming family  values, and expending limitless ammo in an environment free from  sincere physical consequences seep into the mundane plot, the  disorganized and extraneous feel of many of the scenes causes The Watch  to be a consistently threadbare bore.

'The Watch' is An Interesting Sci-Fi Comedy, that makes good-use of its promising premise & its well-decorated star-cast. Its Fun! 

'The Watch' Synopsis: Four men who form a neighborhood watch group as a way to get out of their day-to-day family routines find themselves defending the Earth from an alien invasion.

'The Watch' isn't flawless. It has its share of minuses. But, overall, this first of its kind Sci-Fi Comedy appeals, because it makes you laugh at the right places & the performances are commendable. Talking of minuses, the uneven second-hour acts as a deterrent. 

Jared Stern, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg's Screenplay has merit. However, the second-hour, certainly, could've been more persuasive. Akiva Schaffer's Direction is credible. Cinematography & Editing are mentionable. Graphics are pretty cool. The Aliens are pretty creepy to look at!

Performance-Wise: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill & Richard Ayoade are the life of 'The Watch'. Stiller is highly efficient, while Vaughn continues to impress us with his impeccable comic-timing. Hill & Ayoade are equally effective, adding much more to their characters than offered. Also, the on-screen chemistry between the four of them, is interesting. Rosemarie DeWitt does her bit well. Will Forte is sincere.

On the whole, 'The Watch' does work, at most parts.

2012 was a really rough year for Ben Stiller, with 'Tower Heist' barely breaking even ($75M budget/$78M domestic/$152M worldwide) and 'The Watch' a bona fide box office flop ($68M budget/$35M domestic/$68M worldwide). So you have to ask yourself, how could a film which featured Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill have failed so miserably? Three words, "IT WASN'T FUNNY"!!!!! Plus I really have to question director Akiva Schaffer's vision for this film what was this film suppose to be? A comedy, a sci fi film, an alien invasion flick, a murder investigation who-done-it film, a buddy flick, or a neighbor watch group defending its home turf movie??? My suggestion would have been to pick one genre and run with; however, this film trying to be all of these movies was just too insurmountable to achieve!!!!

Ben Stiller stars as Evan, a local Costco manager. When his nightshift security guard is mysteriously killed (and skinned) while at work, Evan organizes a neighborhood watch group to find the perpetrator of this hideous crime. However, the ragtag group of individuals who answer his flyers include the following: Bob (Vince Vaughn), a husband desperately seeking other men's camaraderie; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a police academy reject; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), the token black guy.

This bumbling foursome is able to uncover that aliens have invaded their little metropolis, and are walking amongst the human populace in the skinned carcasses of their victims. Furthermore, the aliens are also on the verge of completing a radio transmitter which will signal their home planet, and commence a planetary invasion. However, to make this film into a "comedy", writers Jared Stern and Seth Rogen decided that the only way the kill the invading horde is to shoot them in the nads, nuts, penis region. 

This film fails miserably on every level. On a comedic level, the film isn't funny. As a Sci Fi film, it's comparable to 'Mars Attacks'. There is absolutely zero charisma between any of the actors to justify calling this a buddy picture. For a film to be a successful comedy, the jokes should flow freely and effortlessly; however, this film just tries WAY TOO HARD, and the jokes are forced and unfunny. The film sequence where the watch group apprehends their first alien creature and decides to photograph the event for posterity reasons starts out fine enough, then spirals out of control into some sort drunken frat party gone awry. And as stated above, it's not funny.

This is not a dreadful film; however, this much talent should have been able to produce a raucously hilarious film with little or no effort. But what we (the audience) got was just that little or no effort. My understanding is that almost 60% of the script was actually adlib / improv'd by the actors. Note to writers. Do your damn job; comedic actors are only as funny as the written words you have them say!!! I cannot recommend viewing this film. This film is neither good enough to enjoy, nor bad enough to mock, therefore leaving the audience in that indifferent state of being. Indifferent is definitely one place I do not prefer to be when watching a supposed comedy, and would suggest you bypass this humorless travesty.

You know you are in trouble when a cast of men entering middle age are playing characters that would usually be cast with teens. Even with teens they would be the "annoyingly dumb guys" seen in so many films.

I could not find even one saving grace for this film. The actors are all playing characterizations that are two dimensional and that they have repeatedly done before.

Nothing new is added. The jokes fall flat. It feels like it was intended for actors half their age but written buy guys twice their age who thought "those young people will think this is funny." It is not.

Spare yourself from this one.

I can not understand the fairly high rating for this film on this site. The family's of people connected with the film must be giving it high marks.

If you are out there to see a movie this weekend to bore the heck out of yourselves it is the movie you should go and see. Wrapped around supposedly funny cast with a very predictable script to waste 1.5 hours of your life. At first glance I thought I would see a great slapstick comedy with an interesting script of otherworldly creatures attempt to invade a neighborhood and the men with humdrum lives getting together to form a neighborhood watch team protect their neighborhood from the aliens but the movie was not up to par at all. I think Ben Stiller can be funny when he is by himself than teaming up with others to be funny. I loved the Zoelander for sure , I loved all the Fockers sequels except for the Christmas one. I rate The watch 1 out of 10.

Wow, this is absolutely terrible movie. IMDb allows you to explore the world outside of mass culture and lets you get exposure to true cultural diversity. I am huge admirer of IMDb and use it a lot to research wonderful foreign movies. But, sometime you get surprise like this one. This movie is clearly not in range of almost 9 stars. 2 stars it could get ONLY if all viewers from this culture give highest ratings in some strange exhibition of solidarity. 3-4 stars is too high for it unless you need that cultural diversity. Who, in right state of mind, give it more than 1 star, is only question that keeps you watching past 5 minutes. To watch it to the end is too ambitious of a task. Avoid this movie unless you are doing research on psychology of IMDb users.

Really...was watching on HBO and still could not stomach the entire movie. I have seen this same buddy movie like 4-5 times and it gets more tired each time. How do these films get green lighted? I kick myself that against better judgment I went to see the google movie. Vince Vaughn is proof that one good movie (Swingers) is all it takes to make a career. His range is about 3 degrees. You could cut and paste his facial expression and dialog into any of his last dozen movies. I suppose you have to give the guy credit for making the most of what he had. I can't see where in 15 years any of these actors will be playing at the box office. I know I have been tough on these guys but come on this is just not good and a waste of capital. Crowd Sourcing may be e better was to go to fund movies. Just bypass these studio executives...put some real movie lovers in charge!

I can not believe they actually made this movie let alone that Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Jonah Hill were in this piece of cow dung. Well I can see Jonah Hill in it, he usually does pretty bad movies in my opinion. There is no real humor in the movie, the acting is very poor, the writing is terrible, and who knows why this was even produced. The CGI aliens are fairly well done but do come across as just a rip of the Aliens movies. The supposed sex scenes don not show anything, which is not a bad thing, but they are extremely hookie. The police sergeant is a typical comedy tool that of course comes around at the end of the show.

With a ridiculously talented comedic cast, I expected far more laughs than I got out of this film. Vince Vaughn had a few enjoyable lines and snarky moments, and it was enjoyable to see him cast as a father-figure, but the moments were few and far between. Jonah Hill was afforded the same minimal time to show his talents, which is truly disappointing. Ben Stiller leads the cast, and while he's afforded ample screen time and is the narrator, it does not play into his strengths and leaves you wanting more.

*Spoiler Alert* While the addition of aliens could have added to the supposed hilarity of this movie, it only managed to thwart any attempt at humor. The jokes became even more predictable and benign, and I found myself counting the minutes until the movie was over. While I'm glad I never wasted my hard earned money to go see it in the theater, I'm still a bit irked that I even spent $1.50 for the Redbox BluRay rental. I would suggest you save yourself the money, don't even bother with the $0.99 DVD rental and read the Wikipedia synopsis, you might laugh more than as if you were watching the actual movie.

It has been a long while since I had to switch a film off before its finished, but this one managed it. As I haven't watched it to the end, I have to right to comment on specifics, its not worth the hassle anyway. This is appalling.

however making up space:

Seeing the name Ben Stiller, I watched it thinking that at least it would be OK, however this just shows that even big names can drop a howler at times. The script writing is awful, the dialogue woeful and it was actually painful to watch to the point I got too, not that far in to be host. The moment it became plain Ben Stiller's character was going to 'humorously' get the blame for a second murder as well as the first both without reasonable cause, I had to switch it off. That kind of 'Humour' just makes me cringe.

Do yourself a favour and don't attempt to watch this film, you'll only wish you hadn't

A watchable film. Does have humor, but neither smart like South Park nor LOL-inducing. Cheesy and predictable, but somehow entertaining- nevertheless. The film seems to be a unhappy mash-up of different film genres, with too little of everything. For me, the special effects budget didn't really show, the alien animations were good and the concept of a neighborhood watch fighting aliens seemed to be good, but the film is a film with Ben Stiller in it, and you just really cannot expect much from any Ben Stiller film. One thing I felt that made this film okay, was that one of the film's key turning points (where the British dude is revealed to be an alien) made the film seem like Avatar 2, or any "white people betray their own to help natives their invading film", except that it's reverse, where aliens help humans fight their own race due to some magical encounter with the natives (in this case, a local orgy). However, I was really disappointed when the protagonists decided to go stop the alien transmission from being sent (if you haven't seen the film, now you know the whole story). It would have been interesting though if the protagonists went with the British alien's advice and hid out in the deserts. Anyways, this is again one of those time killing films, so if you have nothing important to do, watch this film to kill time.

I wanted to watch a comedy, something light hearted with my boyfriend so I chose The Watch as it had a great cast in it and it had good reviews.

Although I was very much enjoying the film, the thing that ruined it was all the sleazy comments made about women and the orgy scene was completely unnecessary. The film was funny enough without it.

I don't think this film caters to women at all, it's all aimed at men, with the "hot" young girls in skimpy revealing clothing and even in the sex scene good looking young girls with gross fat old/middle-aged men. With all the sexual fantasies which men have and their "jokes" towards women.

It made it very uncomfortable to watch with my partner and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone watches this with their family.

This is my own opinion, everyone will have their own.

The sad day has come where a comedy means plenty of bad " dick " jokes, terrible dialogue, weird symbolism and more unfunny stuff. The cast and producers should be ashamed of what movies have become, and they probably are, guess they don't have a choice anymore. Hope that when the aliens invade, if they are not already here, they burn down Hollywood first. Wasted my time on this, hoping it would turn around before the end, so don't waste yours. I've watched plenty of Ben Stiller movies in my life, and they were all pretty nice, especially Starsky and Hutch, so I can't understand what happened here. Proves once again that actors probably don't have much say in the quality of films produced where they act, they're just in for the money and whatever else, god knows. Maybe they should put up a fine for this kind of movies, where you get your money back, if it's that bad. And I didn't know there are so many German sounding names in the US. A sad day, indeed.
