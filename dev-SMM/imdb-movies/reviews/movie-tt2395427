### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.

That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.

So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.

So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.

I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. Listen...humor is subjective. It's also a big part of these types of movies. When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy.

This is a comic book movie! It's a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! I'm not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would. 

"There's not enough character development!" I've seen this in the negative reviews, too. Look, we've had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. At this point, there isn't much more we really need, is there? Yes, we see more about Hawkeye's personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he's not big enough to carry his own film. And given that he's very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. So the complaints about character development don't hold any weight to me. It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers. 

In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. This movie held my attention from start to finish. 

As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. When you watch it, you'll see why and in my opinion, if you don't enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude!

being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.

So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. 

The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.

Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.

"People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds." - Jeffrey Eugenides 

Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful "good warriors" battle powerful "bad warriors". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.

Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes "talk", "reveal their personalities" and "share their feelings". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because "films are supposed to have these scenes". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.

You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clich√©s. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film "comically" delivers its obligatory "one swear word", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.

Marvel Studios has a history of roping in "irreverent" and "edgy" directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, "Age of Ultron" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's "Ultron" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and "cool dialogue" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.

Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. "Ultron" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.

Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the "Star Wars" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new "Star Wars" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.

Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, "Age of Ultron's" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another "anti violence", "anti military" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.

3/10 ¬ñ What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.

It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done to all involved.

Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.

Well.... 

This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. 

It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. 

Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).

But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.

Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!

In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks "illusion- woman" and "not-the-flash"....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. 

Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more "the next few days of Ultron". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new "hulk buster" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.

In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.

And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. 

Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. 

And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. 

It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.

I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.

Never watch this movie it is an insult to the superhero movie category. Their is simply nothing good about this movie the scene were they are drinking and chilling was OK but 99% of the film was cringy and simply bad it ignored all sense of relationships or personal lives the characters may have and pited them against a hastily put together villain with the personality of a child who often had looney tunes references and scenes, for example near the end Ultron is about to be hit by the hulk and the whole world pauses while he has some cringy unfunny one liner along the lines of "hey how about we call it a truce" then he is punched away into the distance as the world starts back up again it felt like the director had fallen asleep watching a wille e coyote cartoon the night before filming this scene.

The visuals were as great as ever but their comes a time when explosions and different coloured iron man suits don't progress the narrative look at the later transformer movies they made a lot of money yet are awful films, it is disheartening that this trash is the highest grossing superhero movie. The scripts are pathetic the MCU isn't known for good script writing but this film is the worst of the worst every single sentence feels like they are trying to get a cheap laugh out of the audience and that might be OK if it was just iron man up to it but its not every single hero and the villain are cracking wise in every single scene and it isn't funny anymore the script writers need to be sacked it just reminds you of green lanterns cringy script in his standalone. 

A couple of the biggest mistakes in this movie from the endless list of flaws would be how they killed off quicksilver... as any comic fan knows you simply cannot kill a speedster with bullets it is the dumbest way to get rid of such a character and this film did it proud by making the stupidest portrayal of a speedster of screen their has been. They didn't only mess up the characters origin because they don't own the rights to the xmen which could be forgiven but they then released the movie along side his actual portrayal in xmen Days of future past and then went on to kill him off in the same movie he was introduced in i mean really? Visions introduction in this movie has to be one the most forced origin stories i have seen it didn't fit at all with the narrative and they just kept pushing it down the audience throats it was very poorly handled but as spiderman now holds the throne for worst introduction into a superhero movie after Civil Wars lame ass representation of the character it is less shocking as it seems like the norm for the MCU to not give a crap about their characters :'(

Can this film possibly "not" succeed? No. Even if it were a bomb (which it is most definitely not) tens of millions of fans would see it anyway. So it was a guaranteed hit. Nice work if you can get it.

Best line? "I support your avenging." (Mrs. Hawkeye)

Second Best line? "You get hurt. Hurt em back. You get killed. Walk it off." (CA)

Third Best? "Well I was born yesterday." (you know who)

Honorable mention? "Beep beep" (Natasha on her cycle, mimicking her horn, trying to warn pedestrians)

Why did Spader get the Ultron gig? Because of his incredible work in Blacklist. (See it)

What's the best part of this (somewhat long) movie? The back-and-forth between the characters, a Whedon trademark. And of course the action scenes. Possibly the best ever filmed.

What's the worst part? The 40 minute "dead zone" after the Bond-style opening, where the Avengers try to make like it's Happy Hour at the local bar.

Which actor consistently shines? Downey. He is the smartass each of secretly wants to hang out with.

Which actor suffers the most in group play? Thor. The gravitas of being a God gets lost in team work.

Name a massively over-exposed actor who finally got under-exposed? Sam Jackson.

What could we have lived without? "Explaining" to the audience why characters like Pepper Potts were "unavailable" for the story (or possibly too expensive even for a quick cameo)

What is Whedon's greatest enhancement to the Marvel backstory? The romance between Natasha and Hulk.

What is Whedon's strangest tweak? Killing Pietro. The boys at the X-Men franchise will not be happy.

Is this a better movie than AV1? No, but it is just as good. (It tries harder but has pacing issues).

Who wins at the end? The studio. And Joss Whedon who BOTH wrote and directed what could be the biggest money-maker in history. Somewhere in Hollywood, JJ Abrams is actually getting nervous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATED Jan 16 -- OK, so JJ deconstructed the original Star Wars script scene by scene (something no one else had ever bothered to do) and rebuilt it into the 2015 relaunch of Star Wars. And nailed it. The viewer experience, the pacing, is dead-on. And oh by the way produced the fastest film in history to hit 1.0 billion in ticket sales. So disregard the last line of the original review above. JJ is no longer nervous.

...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)

Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. 

The good:

Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.

The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. 

The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.

The Bad:

Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say "It was necessary for character development", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.

The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. 

Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.

Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.

Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.

This movie was a failure on many levels. There was a serious lack of story, the humor was very forced in an overabundance of one-liners, bad CGI in some places, and a very under-developed Villain. The movie focused a lot on the characters in the movie and developing them, but not even that much. We get a few tidbits about each, except Thor, Stark/Ironman, and Hulk/Banner. Thor was hardly in the movie, only shown on screen for a few minutes after leaving the team to basically setup the next movie and where the story is going (Infinity War), but is glossed over so quickly most people won't catch it, especially those who have no idea about story arcs in the comics. Ultron's reveal was absolutely perfect, it set him up as an intimidating and powerful villain, then when he gets his own mechanical body, he turns into a comedy act and does not look real because the CGI metal looks terrible, along with the stupid moving mouth when he speaks.

Every character in the movie was trying to be a comedian in the movie. The only moment that felt serious or dire was the reveal of Ultron (and then turned into a joke later). The ending of course has a big battle with all the Ultron bots, but seriously, why do they even have Thor in the close quarters fighting with them? His lightning could have fried most of them, then they have Thor not fight Ultron back just so Vision (Which they never called him by his name) could be seen holding Thor's hammer again and make a stupid remark about the balance of the hammer.

Stark/Ironman is basically having amnesia forgetting the events of Ironman 3. And then turns into a "mad scientist" with Banner to create Ultron, totally against his way of thinking after the events of Ironman 3. Ironman also does everything he knows the team will get mad at him for doing, but does it anyway without consulting them.

Black Widow is basically the Avengers "Mattress" in that she is now flirting with a 4th Avenger (1st was Ironman in Ironman 2, 2nd was Hawkeye in The Avengers, 3rd was Captain America in The Winter Soldier) and now the 4th is Bruce Banner/Hulk. She is a better character than that, but all she gets is flirting with everyone.

We are introduced to 2 other characters dubbed "The Twins" though they never give them names. Probably because of Fox owns the rights to X-Men, but their names are Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Quicksilver dies, and of course, says a one-liner, and yet we feel nothing for his death as we never knew him......he is a 1- dimensional character. At least in X-Men Day of Future Past we get to know Quicksilver in there, and his special effects were a hell of a lot better.

This film was a catastrophe, and should not be praised in anyway.

Disappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not bad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world expected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of the best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in this movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes, the effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury and another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a future in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the jokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the end where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War film, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than owed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury that was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most not enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from it, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.

This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.

The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to "save the world" - something we've heard before.

We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster story.

The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's "The Avengers," and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.

"Avengers: Age of Ultron" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of "The Avengers," which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in "Ultron" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.

Yet "Ultron" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of "Sokovia" to New York to the African nation of "Wakanda" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of "Age of Ultron" is a non-stop blur.

The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in "The Avengers." When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.

Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) ¬ñ also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch ¬ñ who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.

The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in "Ultron" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words ¬ñ it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.

Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.

"Ultron" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with "Ultron" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.

As "Phase III" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part "Avengers: Infinity War" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.

I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past: that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.

Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's full of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that potential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot bigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short term and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for something truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of Ultron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was disappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.

There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie, but the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the human race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what most villains go for.

I expected Age of Ultron to be a worthy sequel to the glorious Avengers.When I went to the cinema I expected to see something impressive and innovative.I was completely wrong.The movie is a complete mess, with pointless filler scenes.Right from the beginning of the movie they showed a combat scene out of nowhere and without ANY explanations whatsoever.They showed Tony using his Iron Man suit when in Iron Man 3 he destroyed all of them.How did Lokis scepter fall into bad guys's hands ? In order to understand it you need to watch the series ''Agents of SHIELD'', witch is completely unacceptable as far as i'm concerned.Later on they show Ultron,Vision, and Scarlet witch whose abilities didn't even explain ! How did they come up with that idea ? Not all people read comics neither watch the series.Take me for example, during the movie i felt so empty which was the last feeling i expected from the movie.Even the finale witch was supposed to be ''epic'' was so anti-climatic and strange.Don't get me wrong, i LOVED the first Avengers movie, however. this one is just a waste of time and money.It is by far the worst movie of 2015 and the worst sequel i have ever watched.

The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the highly expected sequel to the cultural impactful classic of 2012's The Avengers. within Age of Ultron, you can feel the burden of all this heavy lifting threatening to crush writer-director Joss Whedon, who, by comparison, had it easy the first time out, in The Avengers. His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). This already can seem like a lot, where as the plot is somewhat sort of messy. It is still entertaining but when comparing Age of Ultron to the original, everything about the original has this film beat.

Age of Ultron is a good watch but it's hard to ignore certain boring or forced scenes. As many have said, this film being disappointing only lifts up expectations for the next Avengers film in the franchise. And we all know, the hype level and expectations for the third film will be quite high.

The Avengers are back! Hooray! And naturally with a $316M budget, we could come up with nothing less than this disaster. 

So, the plot is this simple: One of the Avengers create something that (of course) they thought would be used for good. But then (shocking) it turns out that the creation is pulling an "I, Robot" or "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and believes humans pretty much aren't capable of taking care of themselves or Earth. Now the Avengers must stop something that they themselves created (irony!)...with the help of two new friends who at first were helping the creation but then realized "oh he wants to destroy humans" so they switched sides mid-movie.

I guess you get to see Robert Downey Jr. play himself so there is that since he does that so well. You also get to see Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson try to fake their way through an Eastern European accent--and fail miserably. The rest just kind of hang out, nothing spectacular acting-wise. 

There you have it! Another extremely expensive knock-off of movies past. Completely uninspired and not creative. Don't waste your time (or money, if you can't get it for free). The horrible one-liners are predictable just like the plot.

Go, Hollywood!

Long story short--way too much destruction that was often difficult to follow at times. And who ends up paying for all that destruction? Stark? The government? Or both? Without question, the cast was awesome as usual, including the voice of Ultron, James Spader. The slow-mo scenes of everyone fighting was very cool for sure. But the scene where the Hulk goes berserk was way too long. I would have cut the time in half on that part. I was getting somewhat bored after a while.

The characters were great; the story was good and I loved the state-of-the-art technology. Enjoyed seeing Paul Bettany (Jarvis), and now that he's an Avenger, hopefully, we'll see more of him. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were wonderful additions to the cast. Too bad Pietro gets killed but at least Wanda was spared.

The trance scene with Thor, that is, the background scene, was too vague, too quick. The camera shots on the whole, in my opinion, were spotty. It was hard trying to make out some of the scenes--on the whole it was a bit too busy! Sorry! Special effects were great, though.

I have ambivalent feelings about this movie. The whole movie seemed a bit choppy to me. I'm rating it 6 stars.

The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the "creative" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clich√©d and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.

All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise.

I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.

As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.

I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately "human", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.

All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex.

'Avengers: Age of Ultron' was the most highly anticipated superhero sequel ever since the smash-hit of it's predecessor; 'The Avengers'. Joss Whedon returns to the helm, but did he do as good of a job the second time around?

1. The main cast of the first film returns to great effect, but the new additions is where the weight is felt. The blatant fact that Whedon included Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to the cast simply because he said they looked cool, is really not a good reason at all. The two serve somewhat of a purpose, but could easily be removed and not change a thing to the plot. Robert Downey Jr. is the center of attention once again as he unleashes the villainous 'Ultron' after jump-starting a dormant peace-keeping program. It's obvious that this was a forced story- line since 'Ultron' was the creation of Hank Pym/Ant-Man and not Tony Stark.

2. This movie (unfortunately) follows the same beats as the previous in terms of plot points. Loki's scepter is once again the cause of confusion, a villain that is physically inferior (combative-wise), and another faceless army of minions for the Avengers to cut through during the climax. I'm actually glad Joss Whedon left the MCU, cause this would have been the sad direction 'Infinity War' might have been headed. James Spader does an amazing job voicing and motion- capturing Ultron himself. His appearance might be menacing, but he pales in comparison and disappoints every time he faces off against any Avenger. And just like Loki, Ultron is punked during the climax and smashed around by the Hulk.

3. There is a completely out-of-left love-story between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) & Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), which is utterly sickening for the least since Whedon willingly ignored the existence of Betty Ross. I for one was actually relieved when Quicksilver died, cause he was just a waste of space. The introduction of the 'Vision' (Paul Bettany) in the last third of the film was exhausting to me since the movie was already crowded with characters at that point. Luckily the Russo brothers actually found a purpose for the Vision in 'Civil War', so he can probably be excused in this film. I'm still overjoyed that the Russo's will be directing the future Avenger films.

4. The climax is kinda underwhelming to say the least, since it's basically a repeat of the last film. The most impressive sequence actually comes in the middle when Tony Stark summons 'Veronica' (the Hulkbuster armor) to stop the unstable Hulk from rampaging through the streets of South Africa. Audiences were on the edge of their seats for that entire fight scene. Never would I take anything away from the visuals and CGI in this film, because they are fantastic. If it's one thing MARVEL gets right, it's the special effects using ILM. However, this film does way too much advertising of future films crammed into one and it becomes way too obvious and overbearing at times. 

Don't get me wrong, the movie is still fun and enjoyable to watch, but then it doesn't really stand out due to the fact that nothing new is really presented. It's still worth seeing, but Whedon and company fails to ignite nor recapture the thrills they've achieved before.

I felt that there was a disconnection with the other parts. For example, Thor's return is never shown not in this and not in Thor's movies. We learn that he has seen Jane after coming but we are not shown that, seems as parts are missing. Also we are not shown how the avengers got contacted and got together. We learn from the Winter Solder movie that they have to destroy the centres of Hydra but that was just Steve and Natasha, they never mentioned that they will call the others or keep the avengers alive. This is also feels like a part missing. Their get together. 

I am not gonna talk about life lessons or plausibility because its a super hero movie and those are pretty obvious how they are in these movies. I must say however that this part was more concerned with characters dilemmas, their fears. It is an attempt to develop them, let the audience understand them better. A missed target here because firstly, as I said its an super hero movie, the characters are super heroes and no matter their dilemmas because of that they will always come back to the same ending and secondly, they did it poorly and shortly and it just took a lot of movies time without making any impact. 

The story line is impressive however and that's what a movie like this should have, more wow moments and twists and surprises than character's dilemmas. They story is well told with action scenes and fast development and the feeling that you don't know if they all are gonna make it which was new. What I like most about the story is how the story keeps developing through all these series and you can sense that it is going to build into something quite exciting. Makes you more curious about the other parts.

Warning Possible Spoilers: 

Here are my personal reasons why I don't like it as much as the first.

1= The opening prolong is a little confusing spectrally for those of us have either forgotten or have not seen or have stopped watching, the Agents Of Shield TV Show all together. But still really cool. 2= Compared to the first film The Avengers not only functions as a team but they also and feel look like a real team as to apposed to a punch of men and one woman teaming up for one common case. For just one cause. Not only that you could feel and see that their team work as improved compared to the first film. 

3= The humor has not lessened over the previous films. 

4= Ultron's Voice really sucks; he doesn't even sound or try to sound terrifying at all. The design of Ultron could have been better. Also the reveal of Ultron could d have been better, because as of how they did is really poorly done, it's like 'You humans are so weak and pathetic I well crush you al like the ants that you are. Remember my name Ultron Mahahahahahahaha.....' In this movie I find that Ultron talks too much. He just never shouts up, not even Loki talks that much in any Avengers films at least he doesn't seem to be. I feel like this Ultron's threat level is nonexistent at all. I fell like this Ultron is like 'Hay look at me I'm doing bad things and I have an evil clich√© goal in mind hay look at me hay... Mahhahahaha....' Come on guys that's not the way to show Ultron. You know better than that juts look at the way you always present Loki. If I were to classify or compare Ultron to someone it would be G1 Team Rocket (Pokemon) in the show on every episode they always get blown up, electrocuted and or humiliated in some other way. That's how terrible of a villain I think Ultron is. 5= This Quick Silver is not as good as the 'X Men Days Of Future Past' for a start. I find this Quick Silver really flat, not only this Quick Silver is incredibly flat character wise, but also unlike the "Days Of Future Past' for once this Quick Silver does not feel like The Flash to truth I'm on the fence about that. It's like the actor who played Quick Silver had a contract which states that he has to say this one line in every scene that he's in that one line is "What? Too Quick For Ya?" (or something along those lines.) So in other words one liner. And unfortunately I don't recall him having very many lines during the move, and for some reason his accent really bugs me it almost sounds faked. In addition it always seems like he is talking out of breath and that is way before he used his powers. To me I just don't know why it just does. They should re name this Avengers Age Of JOKETron.

6= On the bright side The Hulk Buster in this is the coolest Hulk Buster ever. It's just unfortunate it wasn't mentioned by name. And speaking of I think the Hulk Buster V Hulk fight is one of the coolest parts of the film, but that's just me. 

7= The Natasha/Bruce Banner one on one moments are also one of the coolest moments of the film. You could actually see their friendship grow, that's all I could say without ruining it for you, and besides I want you to witness it yourself its well worth it. 

8= Another coolest parts of the film is Vision himself, I just don't like the way they wrote the origins of his name Vision. The origins of his name is basely having his name being mentioned a half a million times in the same scene that he was reborn. He deserves a much better name origin then that. 

9= Both the climax and the plot itself both feels like a giant hot mess to me, and to a certain extent kind of pointless. Te me. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good moments but I still wouldn't call it a master piece, spectrally compeered to the first Avengers film. But don't get wrong still a good own none the less. At least it's not one of those 'turn off your brain' kinds of films. 

10= I think my favorite line in the entire film is, Nick Fury's "Hope For The Best....." line I just loved that line.

CS= The cool things? It's like Ironman 3 did not happened it has been erased. I'm sorry I just enjoy that movie very much. The only reason that I watch it is to recapture the experience and the memory of the first day of my Oasis Of The Seas Cruse. In the Opal Theater. Another bit of good news is that it's still good enough that you don't even noticed the 2hr 21min run time. And finally a far Warning: DON'T expect an END credits scene like in the previous Marvel films because you would be disappointed like I was. Unfortunately, but there's still a Mid credits scene which was pretty cool. 

So in conclusion: Do I hate this film? No. Do I love this film? Not as much as the first Avengers film to be honest. It's a mixed bag.

I have to say, I watched this movie several times but not for the reasons you might think. I got an absolute kick out of the cynical, snarky, hilarious, egotistical, fun that James Spader had with Ultron. When I found out that he was the voice behind it, I kept watching and listening to the way that he totally immersed himself and embodied the role. It was genius. I got no strings to hold me down. 

The only comic books I ever read growing up were Archie. Gasp, choke, gasp. No Superman, Spiderman, Iron Man, etc. So for me, the characters are larger than life. And since I have no point of reference to compare them to or to critique them against, their personalities are formed and introduced to me on the screen. I learn their backgrounds and history from watching the movie. 

Realizing that all of the characters in these movies are comic book characters, should make you also realize that you can't take these movies too seriously. While I learned a lot about our heroes in this movie and there is much more to any of them than meets the eye, they are still 2 dimensional for me.There is not enough information to flesh them out so to speak, but I'm sure that will come in future movies.However, Stan Lee and his cameos are always nice to see. 

The next thing is to just enjoy the fun and the dialog. Plot?? Who cares. Acting?? Meh. For me, it's fun, it's cool, it's entertaining, and frankly worth the money I paid to buy the DVD. I am collecting all in the Marvel Universe and will continue watching until I am old and gray. Well, older and grayer than I am now. 

For this movie, I do not believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life.

Well,Avengers 2 was probably more awaited than the first one,but unfortunately,it doesn't quite live up to my expectations.Of course it is good to see our heroes go at it again,but the villain is insignificant and is beat at the drop of a hat.Another baseless army,this time,with bots! Sound exciting? The playful tone of the movie make for some fun moments,but stop the movie from having any sort of mystery or suspense.The CGI is top notch,and the destruction effects seem realistic.The new cast members are nice,particularly Johnson and Olsen.James Spader voices Ultron brilliantly,but sadly,the villain is just weak.This movie is good.Overall it is enjoyable,but I expect better from Marvel.
