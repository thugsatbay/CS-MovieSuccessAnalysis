### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Mike Leigh's latest film Another Year follows the story of a happily married couple approaching their retirement years. Their warm relationship offers them security as the the film progresses. Their friends and family, by contrast, all struggle to some extent with unhappiness, and a sense that their best years may be behind them.

The film is a story of ageing; the small events that can make life either comforting or unbearable; and the refuge that companionship can offer.

Rut Sheen's role as Gerri is superb. Her open, welcoming face invites her friend and colleague Mary (played by Lesley Manville) to open up to her about her drunken fears of where her life is leading. Jim Broadbent's Tom is charming and self-effacing, confident in his own happiness yet nonplussed at the failure of his friend Ken  Peter Wight  to come to terms with growing old.

The film dwells on the small, predominantly non-verbal signals that reveal emotional and social insecurity. Leigh's direction reminds us that the sharpest insights into character lie in moments where we think we at our most concealed. Faces betray what we wish were kept private  at moments where verbal communication fails, physical expression lights up hidden fears, passions, failings and desires.

Leigh treats all his characters with a certain dignity  whilst there are moments where we are encouraged to laugh at their social inadequacies, for the most part we suffer along with them, knowing that their experiences are all too near reality to take lightly. We encourage Tom and Gerri to keep supporting their despairing friends, yet knowing at the same time that their married happiness can only serve to mock their friends' lonely lives further. The four strictly partitioned seasons of the film point towards a growing anxiety that it may in fact be too late for these lost characters. The cyclical nature of the structure suggests that there is no real remedy for those left unloved and lonely at the film's conclusion.

From the opening scene, where a woman silently struggles to recollect the happiest moment in her life, to the point when the dialogue slowly fades away to leave Mary isolated and forlorn, we cannot help but be both enchanted and dismayed by the emotional honesty of Mike Leigh's characters. This is what sets out the director as a truly gifted artist  his ability to heighten the routine into the dramatic; and to make the trivial, truly tragic.

Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen), the couple at the centre of Mike Leigh's latest existential piece, couldn't be more unlike the cartoon characters who share their names. Together for several decades, their love for each other has only grown. I wouldn't complain if my marriage looked like theirs when I'm in my 50s.

When he isn't working as a geologist and she isn't counselling people, they spend their time providing solace to those who need it  Ken (Peter Wight), a straight-talking, John Smiths-drinking Yorkshireman; Ronnie (David Bradley), Tom's laconic brother whose wife has just died; and most of all Mary (Lesley Manville), a jittery colleague of Gerri's in the middle of a mid-life crisis. It is Mary who dominates the film and who most elicits our empathy. She is without love and possibly even without the hope of love. It is genuinely painful to see her disintegrate scene by scene. 

As another year in Tom and Gerri's life unfolds, we see nothing particularly fascinating happen. They tend to their allotment, they invite people to their house for food and company, and they reminisce about their experiences. Nothing could be more trivial, right? Wrong. This film is about growing old and making the right choices as one gets to old age. Above all it's about recognising that happiness is less a right than an aspiration.

The word 'integrity' comes to mind when I think of Mike Leigh. Who else could convince actors to sign up to films where there was no script to begin with? Throughout his career he has eschewed the Hollywood system and has done things his own way ('Given the choice of Hollywood or poking steel pins in my eyes, I'd prefer steel pins'). 

An audience member expostulated at the end, 'That wasn't very uplifting'. She's correct, but Leigh doesn't offer folly or fantasy. He's a truth-seeking social observer and commentator. What's also appealing about Leigh is that he doesn't spoon-feed his audience. His films compel the watcher to debate what they have seen and draw their own conclusions. Why should films give us answers? 

I was moved by this film like no other in recent memory. One moment I was laughing uncontrollably, the next I was holding back tears. The film emphasises a sad fact: for some people, things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes we're just plain unlucky. And that's life.

This is a big movie tackling big themes, and may, like Happy-Go-Lucky (Mike Leigh's previous film) prove extremely Marmitish. The latter comment may prove hard to understand if you're not British, and that's just like the film (Marmite is a British spread made from yeast extract with a love-it-or-hate-it umami/savoury/salty flavour). Another Year deals with a particularly British form of social breakdown and emotional constipation.

In Britain, from the 40s to the 70s there was widespread use of an exam system called the 11+. Up until the age of 11-12 students were schooled together, after that point, students considered to have more potential by the standards of the 11+ examinations were streamed separately in Grammar Schools, prepared for success, whilst those below the boundary line were sent to Secondary Modern Schools where the focus was much more on practical education (bricklaying, "home economics", woodwork, etc). The legacy of this system has been huge social resentment. There is a feeling in Another Year that the system is back, in the form of university education. With the UK attempting to educate 50% of the secondary school student population to university level, a socially engineered bifurcation to haves and have-nots is being created once again.

All of the characters in the film are from working class backgrounds and yet the fortunes that life has graced them with are distinctly uneven, they have gone in different directions, absent any idea of a shared experience that may have been the rock of previous generations of Britons. Graduates Tom and Gerri (pun intended) have fulfilling careers, heartfelt love for one another, high incomes, and have had the opportunity to travel widely. Tom's brother and Gerri's friend Mary are aging and alone, undereducated, lacking in the kind of accomplishments that are social currency, living with hurt, and in Mary's case, desperation. The message is not all one way, old friend of the family Ken is also a graduate and yet has not managed to find a place in life either.

Scenes in the movie almost exclusively concern Tom and Gerri's catering to this group of friends and family. They deal with the misfortunes of this circle with a mixture of humour, irony, good cooking and alcohol, but mostly conceal their compassion and are helpless onlookers.

The mating game is key here, the unwedded 40+s exist in a state of unsalved distress, futureless, scrapped. Even 30-year-old Joe, functional, graduate, well-employed and witty has struggled to find someone to be with. A notable absence in the movie is a sense of solidarity, community, public events, shared lives and shared values. There's an illiquidity in the relationships marketplace, a lack of feeling and connection, all leading to a general anomie and social constipation.

However painful the lives of Ken and Mary are, the film gives occasional glimpses of far more infernal lives, lower circles of hell where dissatisfaction has paralysed characters with rage or utter resignation. Anything more than a glimpse would have made the film unwatchable.

Gone are the days when WWII veterans would whimper their way through night-times of post-traumatic hallucination for forty years without mentioning it to a soul, however the British "stiff upper lip" still remains as a guiding principle in this movie. There is still very much the assumption that one should keep one's private hell to oneself, or else outsource emotion to a therapist.

What may be controversial in the film is the way you look at how Tom and Gerri treat Mary. A German lady in the audience voiced her opinion to Mike Leigh that the way they treated her was to look down on her, and that she felt this was inappropriate. Mike Leigh responded that the lady felt like this because she was a German and Germans did not understand irony. Maybe I suffer from the same problem because I for one felt that Mary was treated as little more than a baby, and with a certain hauteur, arms-length love. I think people who are lonely need to feel useful. Mary for example was never allowed to help with anything, though this does not excuse her, at times, appalling behaviour (depression makes people selfish, however I feel it necessary to point out as well that someone who is drowning in a river and calling for a life ring, is also being "selfish" in the same way, and I think metaphorically the position is very similar).

Dour joyless watching, maybe one for the Cabinet to watch, after the example of the film La Haine, which concentrated on French malaise and was screened in front of the French cabinet at the instigation of Prime Minister Alain Juppé.

In Mike Leigh's new slice of life, Another Year, a married couple who have managed to remain blissfully happy into their crumbling autumn days are surrounded over the course of the four seasons of one seemingly average year by friends, colleagues, and family, many of whom appear to suffer some degree of unhappiness or at least confusion. The film is nicely segmented into chapters, following the seasons. All of life is there - from birth, to a funeral. Strangely, or conveniently, given the apparently troubled lives all round, She works as a psychotherapist, while He builds things, but both spend their spare time together growing vegetables in their allotment. Mary, the secretary in her clinic, takes over the centre of the story as she gradually moves into more of everyone's lives. Or perhaps it's just that the film gradually opens up the relationship that was already there. Just as it is with all the extra characters. As it's a Mike Leigh film, all the actors will all have been living "in character" for maybe six months before breezing through, stirring up the plot with their back story and emotional infrastructure.

Lesley Manville, as Mary, the lonely and unstable girl of a certain age - 40, going on 17, really steals this in the final part, which gets even more intense than the rest of it. One thing I noticed right away was that adding to the intensity of the Mike Leigh close-ups, it's all shot in high-definition digital. But in the end it's the total effect that works. The apparent non-acting. The marvellous thing about Leigh is the way he shows really ordinary people doing really ordinary things and makes them really important. He is so compassionate towards everyone in his stories. You just can't help caring, too.

Lesley Manville as Mary truly deserves the Best Actor Oscar for her perfectly nuanced, scary and convincing portrayal of a woman on the brink of personal desperation due to her many life mistakes and to her extremely fragile emotional nature that served to spiral her further and further down toward mental illness with every romantic disappointment and life mistake she made. Honestly, I do not think Meryl Streep could have played this role as well. Lesley was that great in it. An astounding performance, and so touching, as you felt every pain Mary felt due to Lesley's spot-on interpretation of her character's neediness and weaknesses and what they cost her.

This film tells a story(by the 4 seasons)of a year in the lives of a UK couple and their friends. Mary is a secretarial co-worker and friend of Gerri, a professional counselor and the sweet wife of her well-rumpled and very likable engineer/geologist husband, Tom(yes, Tom and Gerri). Mary is the woman we all know at some time or another in our lives.... a woman too attractive to always be alone but always is alone after every failed attempt at a relationship, always suffering badly from each failure to find what she wants so badly.

Not much of an intricate plot here, as in all Mike Leigh films, but the story was such an absorbing and typical Mike Leigh take on the day-to-day happenings in the ordinary and everyday lives of a normal UK couple and some at-risk friends. Tom and Gerri were the couple with these friends in various states of decline, and they always tried hard through their gentle patience, understanding and humor to help them and always be there for them. Ruth Sheen and the great Tom Broadbent played the wife/husband roles to perfection, and were so loving, likable and comfortable with each other and with friends that you wished you had them for your own friends. Wonderful portrayals, both.

See this film for engaging personal interaction and for the best acting performance of 2010, but be prepared for your own uncomfortable and awkward feelings throughout due to Mary's many sufferings and how her endless tales of them affected her(long-suffering)friends. It was a truly human story, sometimes warm and funny, sometimes pathetic and difficult to watch, but at the end you knew you had seen acting greatness.

A strange and sad little film beautifully acted by its ensemble cast. Lesley Manville's agonised performance as Mary, aching with envy at the solidity and comfort of her best friend's solid marriage, must be a shoo-in for awards next year, but Ruth Sheen is also 100% believable as the endlessly patient, almost 'saintly' Gerri. Jim Broadbent's Tom teeters on the verge of hamminess, allowing Peter Wight to steal the male acting honours as Ken, another lonely and alcoholic divorcée.

After a sad Spring and a prickly Summer, Autumn brings romance to Tom and Gerri's bachelor son and Winter brings a funeral (not the one we've been dreading). Anchored by the couple's devotion to their allotment, Mike Leigh gives us a film about the seasons in our lives as well as in our vegetable patches. In life, as in the garden, some things flourish and blossom while others wither and decay.

Often humorous but mostly achingly sad, this is a very fine film about the Ordinary Lives of Ordinary People. Not to be missed.

Greetings again from the darkness. How DARE he? Mike Leigh is such a non-compliant filmmaker. He just refuses to follow the rules ... and film goers are the benefactors of his daring. Mind you, his daring is not in the regards of special effects, stunt work or trick photography. No sir. His daring is with the subject, theme, tone and characters. He is ... GASP ... unafraid of real people! If you have seen Mr. Leigh's work in "Happy-Go-Lucky" or "Vera Drake", you understand that his films can be simplistic on the surface, while carrying multiple layers of commentary and observations. He also has the classic British sense of humor in that very few "punchlines" exist. Instead the humor comes in allowing the viewer to recognize the characters as someone they know, or God forbid, even their own self! 

Mr. Leigh has a history of making films without a script ... only broad based outlines for the characters. The actors then work to fill in the details of the individuals, which in turn, forms a story. This explains why the story does not follow the traditional arc. In fact, the story has no real beginning or ending. What we see are the interactions of people who are friends, relatives, co-workers, acquaintances and strangers. 

The foundation of the film, as well as the foundation for most of the other characters in the film, is the happily married couple of Tom and Gerri, played by the terrific Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. This is a couple who not only love and respect each other, but also enjoy being together. Their friends and family come in and out of their lives, but their bond is strong.

Key amongst this group is their friend, and Gerri's co-worker, Mary (Lesley Manville). Mary is someone we all recognize. She is single, not getting any younger, desperately trying to avoid loneliness (too often with a bottle), masking her fear through fake excitement, and latched onto the security blanket offered by Tom and Gerri's friendship.

When family friend Ken (Peter Wight) makes a move on Mary, she shuns him because of his lack of perfection. She always thinks she can do better. When she begins fixating on Tom and Gerri's son Joe (Oliver Maltman), we really feel her pain but just want to slap some sense into her. The relationships all take a hit when Mary shows up for dinner and is introduced to Joe's new girlfriend ... a wonderfully charming and talented Katie (Karina Fernandez). Mary acts the selfish fool and it drives a wedge between she and Gerri. There is even a line of dialogue earlier on ... never come between a mother and her son! Another character we are witness to includes the great Imelda Staunton as a depressed middle-aged woman who comes to Gerri for professional guidance. We also meet David Bradley as Tom's older brother, Ronnie, whose wife has recently passed.

All of these situations and personalities are balanced by Tom and Gerri as they provide a stable environment ... it's as if they are a fountain of sanity from which everyone wishes to drink. As an added touch, none of the characters are Hollywood beauties. Broadbent and Ms. Sheen would never be mistaken for Brad and Angelina. Rather they are more likely to look like someone you know ... and better yet, their characters live like people you WANT to know. So again I ask ... How dare he?

This movie touches upon current sociological and psychological conditions that result to alienation and loneliness. The theme repeats itself on the problematic characters of a group of friends in their 50s, namely Ken and Mary as well as Tom's brother. They all resort to alcohol but that is the side effect of their problem, not the root cause. There is an unfortunate equation between single people and despair. This bias is expressed also in the story of the couple's son, who seems to worry during the time he is single and who 'has it made' once he finds a girl who assumes his parents' acceptance and friendship, admits she is starving to people she just met (no manners) and licks her fingers (no manners). Meanwhile Tom and Gerry are the voice of reason and somehow, I felt they were also Mike Leigh's voice. Of course, as others here have mentioned, their portrayal may not be seen as virtuous as I have perceived it. There is a certain coldness within their kindness about them just as cold as the way the priest received the late-coming son of the deceased woman at the funeral. 

Mary who is at the centre of the film, is a pile of trouble. She is turned down by Tom and Gerry's ugly son and Tom's socially handicapped brother, only to get attention from fat and alcoholic Ken. In a desperate move to celebrate her independent life rather than mourn for her loneliness, she buys a car but that only becomes a source of more trouble. As if Leigh wants to tell us that no car can give her the happy life of a married couple who live in harmony cultivating their veggies. The question that floats in the air can be whether her unbalanced character has caused her loneliness or vice versa. What keeps this film together are the masterful indoor scenes, the convincing dialogues and the top notch acting. Careful considerations have been made in how people act in their everyday lives and that has been extraordinarily engaging.

A happily married couple is followed over the changing seasons. The portray is that of harmony, love and togetherness. This is as perfect as it gets. Then we get introduced to their friends who are frequently invited for dinner and drinks. They all have something in common : Broken marriages, alcoholism and self denial. The contrast couldn't be more surreal. Especially Mary, who is longing for love and friendship. Her emotional hurt is tangible.

This movie is not about the couple or anything else, it is about Mary and her shambolic life, the pain that she derives from loneliness and her utter failure to get her life back together. Brilliantly and stunningly directed by Leigh, this is a masterpiece of portraying a character that will be, strikingly and tragically, all too familiar with most of us.

Another Year is the kind of film an actor wishes they had been in and any director wishes they had made. Mike Leigh's skillful directing is at its peak. Long, lingering shots of the characters angst (which normally frustrate the audience) are achieved in an effortless way. The acting is so flawless that it is difficult to find fault. The story is simple and meandering...but it works, and works incredibly well. Another Year will not be to the taste of the young kick-cutting action packed generation. It requires a mature audience or an audience that have at least pondered about what their life would be like after their forties.

This will gain nominations and should win Oscars.

Mike Leighs wonderfully ironic yet sweet look at life takes a little twist in this super ensemble movie which centers around Tom and Gerri and shows us these characters mainly as reflected by their friends and kin. What makes the twist is something written in a different review and which is apparently a Continental European viewpoint if I must believe Mr. Leigh. The minor flaw of this film is that Tom and Gerri hardly develop and if they do, it really is downwards as - when you leave the theatre - you are left with some questions as to whether they really are as warm and supportive as they appear prima facie. Why are all their friends alcoholic losers? And why are they so supportive, yet so aloof? We found a few scenes that show how Tom and Gerri feel about Mary (a shoe-in for any award because of the slightly over-the-top, nail biter performance by Lesley Manville). Their friends really make them feel better about themselves. Whatever may be of this Continental take, it is a tremendously enjoyable movie, as always.

On the surface this is a movie about the day to day life of an elderly, happily married couple (Tom and Gerri), their son and friends, among them Mary and Ken. All seems well in suburban London until that very last shot of the film, a most disturbing scene, the climax of the movie.

We see Mary at the kitchen table of her friends and as the conversation passes her by she realizes she doesn't matter to them any more. Worse, we see it dawning on her that she may never have mattered to them at all in their relationship of 20 years. The comparison with her car is inevitable, a vehicle that should have brought her a sense of freedom, but turned out to be a lemon if ever there was one. As another commenter wrote, it is a scene of exceptional cruelty. (Can I nominate Ms Manville for an Oscar, please ?) 

How could this insincerity, this not-so-mild form of wickedness persist over such a long time ? Perhaps it has something to do with the British fondness of manners, but I think it has to do with work, more specifically in Tom and Gerri's case with having a profession, being a professional.

A professional is someone who is applying a set of rules, an algorithm to a standard input to produce a standard output. (What distinguishes a professional from a craftsman is that the input, rules and output are so complex that they defy supervision.) Tom and Gerri are professionals and what they are doing is extending their professional attitude to their personal lives. Their relationship with Mary is professional. Their marriage is dealt with professionally. Their marital bliss is ultimately based on their contentment with the standardized output it produces. Tomatoes anyone ?

Contrast this with Ken and Mary. Ken is an alcoholic in bad physical shape. He was once handsome however and has a good heart. His problem is that he questions the meaning of his job, which in his case seems to amount to questioning the meaning of his life. And then there is Mary. Her goal in life is Love, not work, thereby committing the ultimate sin (not making work your life goal that is).

Two scenes illustrate the stranglehold work has on our lives (and the importance of it for the movie's theme, I think). In the first an Asian couple is visiting Joe, an old man threatened with eviction and a young woman acting as his interpreter, her ability to help the old man, however, limited to the duration of her lunch break. In the second Carl arrives too late for his mother's funeral, having been stuck in a traffic jam. The funeral couldn't be postponed however, another one was already waiting.

So are Tom and Gerri right ? At the dinner table Tom is telling of how he and Gerri met, by chance on their first day in university. This detail hints at the internal inconsistency of their way of life. And of course right at the beginning of the movie there is this session of Gerri with the sleepless patient, an Everywoman. It shows her utterly failing in her role of counselor, her very profession.

Mary is indeed looking for love in all the wrong places. At the end of the film you realize that, despite all appearances Tom & Gerri's was such a place.

Please just strangle that smug couple before I throw something at the screen .. is this the reaction you hoped to evoke Mike Leigh? Or are Tom and Gerri your idea of a "healthy" couple? Are you likewise vapid and sanctimonious? Of course your nebulous framework leaves us only to wonder ...what WAS the message here? yes it made me think, forced me to draw my own conclusions and for that you have again triumphed. These characters stirred up lots of emotion in me. I felt disdain for the heroes (note son's cajoling girlfriend) and genuine empathy/fondness for the tragic ones (all of them).. but then again which were the real tragedies ? Geri and her like are the reason I avoid therapy. Having never struggled herself she is hardly sympathetic. The sanctity of her boring life shelters her from developing real relationships with the fascinating people surrounding her. Ditto Tom. Their shared comfort is wrought with complacency and co-dependence. Neither feels a need to truly relate with other people as they consistently crawl back into each others arms for a nightly sh*t talk about their less fortunate friends. There is nothing wrong with a symbiotic relationship but this one is so lofty and banal I'd rather be single and have a ..well.. personality. that leads us to Mary. poor desperate Mary. She took chances in life that earned her a colorful personality, but scarcely more. She did not settle into monotony yet she found only heartache. She is horribly lonely. Mary's emptiness leads her to vices like alcohol, little red cars and fake friends. Still she is more genuine than the other star players here as she is honest with her misery.

The plot and character details are outlined elsewhere. This film is a superficial view of deeply unhappy/superficial people whose reasons for deep unhappiness are unexplored and unresolved. Since we learn almost nothing about these people (and they certainly seem to learn nothing about themselves), it is, worst sin of all, boring.

The emotional center/hole of this film is Gerri, the counselor, whose inadequacy/ ineffectiveness is highlighted by an early scene with a potential patient, the actress Emelda Staunton, a working class person who presents with depression. After an introductory session, it seems highly unlikely that Staunton will ever return since Gerri makes no connection to her, which is the theme of the entire movie. (Notably for a real therapist, the first order of business besides making a connection is to determine Staunton's suicide risk, which seems considerable (she is asking for sleeping pills and suggesting that "sleep" is the answer for her problems. Avoiding the real larger problems is also a theme of this movie.) We then see Gerri as the enabler for the alcoholic Mary, a secretary at her work, who she has known for 20 years. They go out to drink after work occasionally where Mary's drinking is not subtle. It becomes apparent that Mary has had a series of spectacularly inappropriate failed romantic relationships (including one with a married man) and during the movie, an attempt at relationships with Gerri's son, 20 or so years her junior, and Tom's brother whose wife has just died. No effort is made in the movie to understand where this behavior comes from. Remarkably, Gerri only suggests therapy for these destructive behaviors after Mary's behavior threatens Gerri in her family. Other developments show Tom and Gerri don't really care for Mary at all and probably never have. It is the ultimate irony that it is Gerri who tells Mary she needs to take "responsibility for her actions" when it is Gerri who needs to take responsibility for her own actions.

Tom and Gerri's relationship is quite solid if smug (and is apparently the main draw for the movie as a whole) but in many ways is a cliché of male female roles, Tom being the technical sort and Gerri being in the helper professions. Tom gets away with being emotionally clueless. When asked by Gerri what to do with Mary, his reply is that if Gerri doesn't know, how could he. Tom's two brothers seem to be the logical extension of his clueless-ness. Ronnie is essentially catatonic and totally estranged from his only son, while another brother (who we only see briefly) is called a jerk even by Tom. There is no explanation for any of this.

Joe, the "perfect son" works as a lawyer for the poor where his condescension to his clients is equally striking. Joe and his new girlfriend Katie's relationship seems designed to parody his parents relationship. While there seems to be the implication of a close relationship of Joe with his parents, in fact, he kept the existence of his girlfriend from them for three months, suggesting a substantial distance (the girl friend had no problem telling her parents). His introduction of her to them is bizarre, having her literally jump out at them from behind a doorway, more or less the physical equivalent of springing her on them after three months. The parents take this entirely in stride and seem to think nothing of this, trivializing what they have been waiting for for who knows how long. We see no discussion among Tom and Gerri what this might mean for them as a family or how this makes them feel. This serves to emphasize the distance the film has from the actual characters.

Over and over again, Tom or Gerri ask "how are you" when it is completely obvious that the person to whom this is addressed is collapsing.

All in all, a series of poorly connected people with no insights or resolution. If that is what you want, here it is.

Many comments in this forum gave a me a wry smile, none more so than the disappointed Portuguese couple who'd obviously wanted a feelgood movie to sweeten their jolly to London, and the 'Vampires Suck' lady who believes that a film must have a definable plot and ending. Thank God for films which refuse to pander to us while we munch expectantly on our popcorn.

This film does NOT offer an uplifting story (or even a plot), or special effects, or a happy ending. Follow the signs to Men In Black instead. Another Year is slow, it's sad (even depressing), and it reeks of personal desperation. But I think it is a hugely underrated gem of a film... if you're prepared to put in the work. It is simultaneously a celebration of fine acting craft and a test of the audience's interpretative skill.

It's difficult to think of a more astonishing performance than Lesley Manville as Mary: hers is a slow & excruciating descent from naïveté & painful insecurity to abject, exhausted desolation, from which we don't expect her to return, no matter how much we hope that she will. Her final scene is as haunting and heartbreaking as any which you're likely to see. We know that her hell is probably of her own doing, but it doesn't prevent our pity of her.

The central characters Tom & Gerri are generally considered happy, and towards whom unfulfilled family and friends gravitate as if Tom & Gerri's union was life's ideal for happiness. However, this 'ideal' is shown up by the absence of any obvious elation, joy or excitement in Tom & Gerri 's lives, and we are similarly responsive to their characters: we neither like nor dislike them, because their happiness seems attractive to others only as a foil to risky failure, not as something to genuinely aspire to. I think Mike Leigh presents us with several questions and human hypocrisies: Mary's disgust at fellow lost soul Ken is surely a subconscious terror of her own similar failures, and Gerri's general benevolence towards longtime friend Mary is exposed as mockery and patronisation when she's in private. Had Mary's & Ken's situations been rescued by the arrival of their respective loves on white horses we may well have been celebrating the exhilaration of love discovered after life's tumultuous roller-coaster. Then the colourless contentment & smugness which Tom & Gerri offer up as life's nirvana would've been relegated to last-resort mediocrity.

Trying to catch up with the Oscar nominees has been a disappointment. I can't see anything substantial about the 'great movies' of 2010. So a little movie like Another Year is a rare blessing.

British filmmaker Mike Leigh and his ensemble of veteran actors  Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen, Lesley Manville, Peter Wight, David Bradley, Imelda Staunton, Philip Davis  get together for one of Leigh's improvised screenplays, full of naturalistic dialogue, and the result is a powerful drama, sprinkled with a healthy dose of humour, about loneliness, alienation, sadness, the emptiness of modern life and that hard to explain feeling of being trapped in a room without doors every day of your life.

Another Year is a triumph of acting and writing. All the actors, perfect in their roles, deliver mesmerising performances. This is the ensemble movie of the year  forget The Social Network or The King's Speech. Whether it be Martin Savage, who bursts into the movie with the power of a tsunami and electrifies the screen with a performance burning with anger and aggression for a handful of minutes, or Lesley Manville, who's the centre of the movie, draining herself out of energy like a power battery little by little as her character's life becomes progressively worse and she gets more desperate, the movie never fails to personify the excellence of acting.

The story, divided by the seasons, takes place over the course of a whole year, and concerns the middle class couple of Tom and Gerri and the dysfunctional, depressed people who orbit around them  co-workers, old friends, relatives. Well-adjusted, well-off, happy, they're like a rock of stability and counsellors to others. They organise barbecues in the garden, cook for friends, listen to their problems. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen slip effortlessly into their roles, radiating joy, serenity and patience.

The movie, however, would be dull if it were just about happy people. The underside of all this happiness is that it attracts the misery of others. Many people, always in trouble, slip in and out of their lives: the old friend Ken (Peter Wight) who can't accept aging and the new generation supplanting his; their distant son, Jerry (Oliver Maltman); Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley), whose loss of his wife has left him sort of numbed. And then there's Mary (Lesley Manville), the emotionally-draining friend whose craving for attention and nurture leads to some of the tensest and most embarrassing moments in the history of recent dramas.

At the start of the movie Imelda Staunton, in a short but amazing performance, plays an unhappy woman talking to a counsellor; on a happiness scale of one to ten she doesn't hesitate to give it one; she can't explain why, she only knows that nothing changes and she can't remember any happy memory in her life. Without stating it, this is the direction Mary is heading for.

I think cinema in 2010 has created few characters as fascinating and complex as Mary. When she first enters the screen she looks like she's plugged to a nuclear power station  she just goes on and on and on and on, without running out of energy, a chatterbox to end them all. But this is all illusion. She talks because she fears silence, the emptiness. She doesn't have much of a life: she only knows Tom and Gerri, she prowls bars looking for men, she drinks a lot and she's decided to buy a car (possibly because, like drinking, it fills her life with a semblance of substance). Her wearied face, with its sunken eyes, has sadness and fear carved deep to the bones. I've never seen Lesley Manville in a movie before, I just know that for two hours I believed there was a miserable woman called Mary in London probably contemplating suicide. This is the beauty of the movie: it makes the viewer imagine things that aren't there. Manville impersonates her character so well, she gives it so many ticks and mannerisms, the life of her character extends outside the screen; I can still imagine her living now that the movie is over. The character is fascinating but Leigh also made an excellent decision to give it to Manville.

The dialogue also serves this movie very well. Possibly the best scene in the movie is the awkward scene when Mary meets Joe's new girlfriend. In a previous scene Mary had made very obvious advances to him. When she meets Katie (Karina Fernandez), all her resentment spills out in the form of double entendres incomprehensible to Katie but obvious to Joe and his family. The tension just keeps rising and rising, becoming unbearable, but there's no respite for the viewer, it keeps going, and it's funny and brutally sad at the same time.

Mike Leigh received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for the screenplay. He won't win, of course, but his loss won't feel as unfair as the snub Lesley Manville got. In a year when an overrated Natalie Portman is set out to win an Oscar for a mediocre performance that ticks off all the boxes on a long list of clichés about tormented geniuses coping with madness, it's a delight to watch Manville truly embodying loneliness and unsurpassable despair. Perhaps it was too raw, too realistic, for audiences to digest. The caricatural Nina of Black Swan is definitely easier to cope with (and we can even get aroused by her). Movies like Another Year easily get lost in the confusion of vapid press releases, viral marketing and controversy. I'm not so deluded to think that time will restore it to its proper place in film history. I just hope that, amidst all the noise generated by hype, the people who can enjoy a movie like this discover it.

If you don't know Mike Leigh then you haven't been watching too many British films. If there is a British filmmaker that you have a knackering to see, then I suggest you watch Mike Leigh. His Secrets & Lies made a splash at the Oscars more than a decade ago when it was nominated for five Academy Awards.

I was just a mere lad when Secrets & Lies debuted and I didn't quite grasp the concept of it....so, I wrote it off. What a stupid kid I was back then. Mike Leigh has to be the absolute master of everyday human functionality. He is just so perfect with words that I would look like an inarticulate gutter baby next to him.

Another Year takes place over four seasons within the course of a year -- we get to follow an extreme happily married couple with very unfortunate names, Tom & Gerri (Broadbent & Sheen, respectively). Gerri has a friend from work named Mary (Manville, who should have been nominated last year, hands down) who is, to say the least, envies the women from TV's Desperate Housewives. Tom and Gerri have a son, Joe (Maltman), who coyly rejects the advances of said desperate housewife while also trying to be the utmost proper gentlemen he can be. It's not like Mary is devoid of men of any kind -- she very rudely denies the advances of Tom & Gerri's friend, Ken (Wight), who would probably treat her like a princess.

I know that it may seem long at 124 minutes (5 minutes is credits) but I wanted more. I wanted to see how everything turned out.... but.... I understand the film and why it ended where it did. So often do we get a picture that shows us the life of regular, ordinary people. That's what this film is all about. It's one year out of the life of normal, regular people. There are no superpowers, no villains, no evil corporation or pirates to defeat. No hidden pregnancies, deceit and who slept with whom nonsense. This is real life. Please keep in mind, that this is not a mystery picture or brain-teasing thriller... this is a character study/piece that will engage you with it's characters, make you chuckle a bit with the often subtle humor that is life and maybe even put you in a 'what if that happened to me...' sort of mentality.

First, a confession: I don't enjoy watching Mike Leigh films. For me, they're a bit of an ordeal, rather than a pleasant night out. 'Another Year' was no exception; but it certainly made me think...

Imagine you're looking at a picture, one in which there's a wealth of painstakingly drawn detail. For the sake of argument, let's call it 'The gulf between tolerance and understanding': A family is gathered around a table in a large suburban kitchen. They're clearly happy and comfortable, all are laughing and chatting together; a man and woman, nearing retirement, and a younger couple, holding hands lovingly. From the clothes they wear and the surroundings, you'd struggle to place the date; it could be any time in the last forty years.

In their midst are two others. A man, gaunt and unkempt, his grey moustache and fingers tinged yellow with tobacco; and a middle-aged woman, one hand clasped around an empty wine glass, as she fumbles for a nearby bottle with the other. Both stare from the picture, unsmiling and trance-like; clearly apart from the family scene playing out around them.

What thoughts and emotions would the artist of the picture be trying to convey? Well, work that out and you may be on your way to understanding this film, of which this is the closing shot.

The film begins in a similar vein, with a woman that hasn't slept properly for a year, her look also vacant and haunted. She doesn't drink, has seemingly no means of escape from what's troubling her; and can't remember when she was last happy. A doctor asks her questions, trying to find out why she can't sleep and the story begins. It's a scene that needs to be watched very carefully; without it, the point of the film may be lost.

Another Year closer to the grave? Or 'what have we done? Another Year over' (Lennon) My feelings are that the latter is pretty close: the central characters have grown comfortably numb in their middle class lives, pottering in their vegetable patch and commuting to work. They both seem blissfully in control, self-sufficient, free from stress and unhappiness; or perhaps they've always managed to skilfully avoid it? During the course of the film, though, we also see the sad lives of others: their friends, family and associates, people who could do with their advice and involvement. Is it given? I refer you back to the picture. You guess.

As the closing credits roll, perhaps we should all know what's keeping the woman awake?

This movie was one of the most depressing films I've ever seen and I can relate to it after living 2 years in sad England. Contrary to what many people around the world think - British society is highly dysfunctional, depressed, lonely, lacking in emotions, cold, insensitive and angry. This film depicts all of that. There is an old English couple who are together after years of being Married but they are awfully Boring people.... they have a son who looks like a "potato" and has no personality... and all the other characters in the movie are faaaar toooo depressing to even mention. Sadly - this is very true about modern British society - and I really feel that Britain is the most depressed ugly nation in the world. Compared to France - Britain is socially backward, inept and full of loneliness and this movie successfully shows all that on the Big screen. Moreover Britain is UGLY - and the people are ugly - their ugliness stems not from their race but rather from their diet and depression caused by loneliness.

It's funny but I compare this film to another recently released french movie - My afternoons with Margueritte - which was full of emotions, warmth, drama and beauty... and that is France for you. Even the poor in France are more human than any British - who have all become very cold insensitive people with no connections with their families, society or friends (if they even have any). There is no sense of "community" left in Britain - and it's become like this greedy money obsessed nation where people don't care for each other or for normal human relations. Another Year also shows the reality of family relations in the UK - a son is late for his mother's funeral and doesn't really give a damn anyway - his father lost his wife but seems lost himself...the day she dies he wants to drink beer instead of tea....these are all real situations in everyday life within British society. The little bit of multi-cultural-ism in UK has made it somewhat colourful and interesting - and if it hadn't been for that I would have killed myself in this depressing country after a month of living here. The movie should have been named - "Another Sad Year in Britain".

Many, many years ago, as a young single woman, I saw a counselor, who helped me, and who I thought of as a friend. When I married my husband, I invited her to the wedding. She declined, telling me our relationship was professional only. So when, at the end of this movie, the therapist Gerri tells the disturbed Mary, who thought she was a friend of 20 years duration, to see a therapist, I had a different reaction to this movie than many others.

This movie, about the happy middle-class couple Tom and Gerri, is more a cautionary tale that "friends" are not the same as family, and that therapy and friendship evidently cannot mix. The therapist Gerri's "friend" Mary is a middle-aged, lonely, depressed co-worker who has been a frequent visitor to Tom and Gerri's home for 20 years. There are jokes that she was an "auntie" to the 30-year-old son, who, in an excruciating episode, she drunkenly hits on. When she encounters the truth that the son has a girlfriend, Mary is "inappropriate" and rude. Even worse, she is revealed as of a lower professional caste from the girlfriend, who rather irritatingly fits in beautifully with the middle-class professions of Tom and Gerri.

So Mary is a family "auntie" no longer and we learn in the final segment that she has not seen Gerri for some time outside work since the episode with the girlfriend. When she shows up at the house uninvited, Gerri and Tom are surprised to see her. We see them staring at her through the sitting room door, and I thought the expressions on their faces was so cold and even chilling. These were not the faces of friends who would normally be concerned for a friend who has come to them because of some trouble. This is when I first realized that the friendship of Tom and Gerri for Mary was only an illusion; that to them, Mary was just a person who had drifted into their orbit but who was welcome only when invited. Gerri tells Mary that Mary has "let her down" and that Gerri has had to put family first. She tells Mary that Mary should seek professional therapy for her problems. This speech is delivered in a professional voice. Gerri, who is supposed to be warm and nurturing, is cold to Mary, as cold as she was in her counseling session with Imelda Staunton which starts the movie.

At the same time, Tom's brother, Ronnie, who has been widowed, has not been seen at all during the prior year and has not even been mentioned. But he was invited to stay; he is family. In the end, at the final dinner, the camera works its way slowly around the table. The talk among Tom, Gerry, their son Joe and his girlfriend Katie is jovial and cheerful, and, I would think, unbearable for someone who has just days earlier lost his spouse. The camera hits Ronnie, who is still nearly catatonic. And finally the camera focuses on Mary. You see on her face that she has realized that she is not part of the family, she is not the "auntie" nor even really welcome.

This movie, I think, is remarkable for eliciting so many responses.

Dear god this film tried my patience. The alleged amazing performance from Leslie Manville as the terminally stupid Mary was lost on me. She made Brenda Blethyn in the vastly over-rated 'Secrets and Lies' seem subtle. 

I don't necessarily need a strong plot to be able to enjoy/respond to a film but I do need a point, and this film lacked any reason at all to exist. Some people in late middle-age are happy and others are completely miserable? What insight!

I put this film squarely in the Mike Leigh dustbin along with 'All or Nothing' and 'Secrets and Lies'. It does not belong up there with 'Naked', 'Life is Sweet' or 'Happy-go-Lucky' - all masterful, multi-layered films with an excess of emotional resonance. Watch those instead, not this exercise in pointlessness.

This film certainly aged me. 2 hours of plodding wooden drama with minimal interplay between the principals and almost no story development at all. 

A great sense of relief came over me when the fade to screen indicated that it was over after a penultimate excruciatingly slow morose scene between 2 near mute characters. 

My idea of hell would be dinner with the director of this leaden effort.

A totally joyless experience all round, in keeping with most of his body of work.

Thankfully it was half price day at the cinema so we only felt 1/2 cheated of our hard earned cash

2 hours and 5 minutes of an utter suicidal, depressive, boring image of life in the UK. I know its bad here in the UK but if this were a true example of life in the UK, then, I think there would be a huge outcry to legalise assisted suicide in this country.

No plot, no story development, no character development, characters come and go without warning and without any conclusion. How this can be nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. Yes we all know that award ceremonies these days are politically motivated, but what is the motivation behind this? 'Don't complain about life, it could be like this'.

Judging by the nominations for awards, that this has film has received, it only serves to prove that, 'it's not what you know, it's who you know'.

This should carry a warning that 'viewing will damage your health', avoid watching at all costs.

They are quite rare, the movies in which no shot is fired, no crime is solved and no car is chased. Another year is such a movie. It is a movie without spectacular twists or beautiful locations, but with people and events that could be real. It's about friendship, desperation, love, disappointment, hope. That's why I really enjoyed this movie.

Mike Leigh is a specialist of such slice-of-life movies. In this film, he shows us the day-to-day life of a happy loving couple and their not so happy friends and family. The acting is absolutely outstanding, with Lesley Manville in the role of her life. If anyone deserves an Oscar, she does.

But then again, you could call this a boring movie. My movie-going companion did. His point is: if he wants to see real life, he can look around him all day. That's not what he's going to the cinema for.

In a way, he is right. Cinema is about seeing things you don't see in real life. Famous stars, suspense stories that make you wonder whodunit, comedy which makes you laugh, intelligent plots and sudden twists, or even a new insight in a historic event. Wasn't it Hitchcock who said that he left everything ordinary out of the film?

It gets a 3 but only because of the actress who played Mary and for Imelda Staunton's cameo. Where to begin. This script would not pass Screen writing 101 at a third rate community college. There is no unity of theme. Whatever story there is exists with the secondary characters. It rambles and is out of focus. Oscar Wilde would call it the boring in pursuit of the mundane. The actress who plays Mary is exceptionally good and it is the only reason to see it. When I saw it many people walked out and I would have been with them except I was with a friend and I also fell asleep a couple of times. Questions. What is the point? What is it about? If it's about Mary then make it about Mary. And finally, where is the insight? It's fine if you have your characters talk about dishwashing liquid for ten minutes if something is going on in the subtext but why do I have to spend all this time with dull people talking about dishwashing liquid unless there is some insight I'm going to be given or some satisfying story or some emotional payoff. Not here. Skip it. Spend a couple of hours with a boring neighbour and save yourself the admission fee.
