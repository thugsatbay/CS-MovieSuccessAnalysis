### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
So last night from 7.30pm through 2am. I sat through the Cornetto trilogy at the Vue cinema in my hometown, Worcester. Watching 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' again really boosted the hype for what was to follow, come midnight... 'The World's End' began! 

So the film started like every other Cornetto film, allowing us to get attached to our lead characters, learning a bit about their backgrounds through comical contexts! The film follows our five leads, portrayed by Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan, whom 20 years after a failed pub crawl, reunite to repeat the crawl and return to their hometown, Newton Haven, to do so. However, all is not what it seems. Over the due course of the night, the gang began to discover that the town has been taken over by robots attempting to "reform humankind", completing the crawl becomes the least of their worries.

The film is extremely clever, like Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz they have mixed two genres, this time Sci-Fi and Comedy, to create a film on par with the rest. From the first pint all the way through to the "bitter end.. or lager end" the crew have to use their wits to avoid being detected and caught by the pursuing robots, all of which ends with devastating consequences. It is a must-see if you enjoyed the other two. Edgar Wright's trilogy has come to a fantastic end!

Normally I really enjoy movies written by Simon Pegg. I especially liked Shaun of the Dead and Paul. This movie really stumbled.

Remember that scene in Shaun of the Dead in which they decide the best thing to do is head toward a pub and defend themselves from the zombie horde from there? This movie makes that idea its central theme, changing the zombies into some sort of alien robots, and multiplying the pubs. That's it.

Paul had me laughing out loud every minute or two, and I never get tired of watching it. The World's End gave me just a couple of chuckles throughout the film. And I almost nodded off several times.

The setup before the robots appeared was too long and tedious, and after the robots appeared I couldn't quite understand why our characters kept running from pub to pub. And worse, I didn't much care.

It just wasn't silly enough, witty enough, or clever enough to hold my attention.

The World's End is about all about trying desperately to re-live former glories and the film ends up mirroring that. You come away remembering how great Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were, and how sad it is to see the same talent serving up something so lackluster.

The story has a promising concept, but it's a dud from the start. The pub crawl idea simply doesn't work when meshed with the sci-fi invasion. Because after the 'robots' are revealed there becomes no reason for them to continue drinking. You can throw up a flimsy explanation that they continue so as not to arouse suspicion, but it doesn't wash. Put simply: once there are robots around, you do not care if they get to The World's End.

Furthermore, I didn't much care if they got killed/replaced. None of the five are very sympathetic and they are for the most part very nondescript. These are not the kind of drinking buddies you want to go on a ride like this with. Freeman, Marsan and Considine all play similarly bland characters. They're really nothing but place-holders. Pegg and Frost, having nailed the lovable doofus previously, obviously wanted to play against type for this one and it backfires massively. If Shaun and Ed were on this pub crawl, I'd be in. Gary and Andrew? I wish I'd bailed after the first round.

Even the direction felt oddly off here. Of course there were the obligatory half-second shots of pints being poured, keys turned, etc. But it lacked the energy of Wright's previous work. In fact, it felt like no-one's heart was really in it. The whole film was came off like an idea they no longer believed in. Either that or they just haven't got it anymore. A bit depressing either way.

It's sad when people you love serve up something you hate, but The World's End is a turkey. I only wish I'd drunk twelve pints before seeing it.

I thought this movie was mediocre at best. I laughed out loud a few times--as did the rest of the audience, but other than that I found it boring and actually nodded off twice. One of the girls sitting in front of me stated, "well it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good either", which I thought summed it up pretty well. The biggest shock was that it had a 7.9 IMDb rating which normally indicates a potentially "great" movie in any category--especially a comedy. (anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what I consider a GOOD movie).I give it a 5.5 or maybe 6. THere were several other movies in the same theater with lower IMDb ratings that, in retrospect, I wished I had spent my time and money on.

Saw it at a midnight premier last night (free Cornettos were given out!) and myself and the rest of the audience were laughing throughout, having a thoroughly enjoyable time. I thought it was great, definitely on a par with Hot Fuzz, though - to me - not quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, which is fair enough as it is one of my all-time favourites. It is definitely a worthy close to the "trilogy" though, and it stands up well against the other two.

Amongst the highlights were seeing another former Bond actor, even if it was in a small role, along with various other regulars from the past films and Spaced - Tyres, Julia Deaking (Marsha), Bill Nighy's voice, Mark Heap, et al.

With a plot as ludicrous as this one the film relies on the strength of it's leads to succeed, and they pull it off admirably. I liked that there was a role reversal of Pegg and Frost's usual character dynamic, with Frost especially noteworthy in his performance. The lads have clearly come a long way over the years. Pegg is clearly having a whale of a time, and carries us the audience along with him. Having such a talented group of back-up actors in Marsan, Considine and Freeman helps massively too.

I feel they missed a trick by not using the line "You've got blue on you", though.

Here's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched it five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through their reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar additions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of adolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a nod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What could go wrong?

Quite a lot actually.

Pegg plays a character who is so unremittingly obnoxious that by the time the moment of redemption heaves its rotting carcass over the hill you really don't give a damn. He spends the first thirty minutes with his mirthless grin, his back slapping enthusiasm and his voice turned up to eleven and I was overwhelmed by the feeling that, in real life, someone would have punched him by now.

The other characters are a pretty dull and predictable bunch too and frankly by the time the perilous bits kicked in I really didn't care who lived or died.

I kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with robots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the world as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely connects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete loss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that was the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even remotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that an insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything other than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really funny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.

I didn't think this trilogy could get any better. However it somehow exceeded by expectations. With fantastic direction from Edgar Wright,smart writing from Wright and Simon Pegg and hilarious performances from Pegg, Nick Frost and everyone else the World's end is a great way to end the trilogy. The story focuses on a group of childhood friends who go back to their hometown in order to repeat a legendary pub crawl that ends with a pub known as the World's End. However they realize that their whole town has been taken over by robots and it's up to them to stop them from taking over the world. I will admit that my only criticism of the film is that it does start off a little slowly. The jokes felt a little stiff at times with their execution and most of the humor was coming from Pegg's character. However once the robots come in the movie does pick up the pace and lives up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The performances are very funny with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually switching roles. Pegg is more of the bumbling idiot whereas Frost is the straight man. The other performance are also good with Martin Freeman,Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan. I also loved the ending which has probably the best ending out of any of the Cornetto trilogy movies Overall the movie is incredibly funny despite having a slow start. It's a perfect mix of comedy and science fiction. I hope there's more to come from these very funny and talented guys.

Five pre-middle-aged male friends are drawn to Newton Haven, the site of their failed dozen-pub crawl as students in 1990. They're led by Gary King (Simon Pegg). He's the one who couldn't move on from that night; couldn't get a job like them, or get married like them. Reluctant revelry and bad-tempered banter ensues, before the gang discovers that the residents of the town have changed. That is, they have BEEN changed...

The World's End is considerably better than the ostensibly similar This Is The End, a super-indulgent American comedy which mistook f-bombs for humour and name-dropping for satire. Edgar Wright's film is indulgent also, but at the service of audience enjoyment, as opposed to the enjoyment of the players. The script is surprisingly dense and intricate, many of its jokes arriving bittersweet. In an era when so many comedies are heavily (and lazily) improvised, it's refreshing to watch a tightly woven story unfold for once.

The action scenes are given equal attention, lovingly choreographed like some kind of slapstick dance. Chief pugilist is Andrew, our sort-of-hero, played by Nick Frost with remarkable agility. This instalment is far less bloodthirsty than its predecessors - more Scott Pilgrim than Shaun.

The rest of the group is made up of Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, and Martin Freeman. The performances are all top-drawer, although it takes time for their individual personalities to emerge. But then, the fact that they are now practically indistinguishable may be the point - for all their disapproval of Gary, they are the ones playing it safe.

What's most impressive about The World's End is the fact that it's actually about something. Nostalgia is easy to indulge but difficult to deconstruct, but this film genuinely aspires to explore the idea of selective memory - as with a bad hangover, our memories tends to return in subjective spasms, and the truth is only accessible by gathering multiple witnesses. And the truth isn't always what it cracked up to be.

The World's End is, for me, the best of the "Cornetto Trilogy". Highly recommended.

Five friends return to their hometown to relive a pub crawl they never finished in their youth, however, they find their town has been invaded by interstellar beings 'Blanks' and the crawl could literary kill them.

Director/writer Edger Wright returns with this British set, sci-fi, beer-fuelled pub crawl yarn. Once again like Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007) what makes this so likable is the Simon Pegg and Nick Frost combination - the two have great chemistry, they're not only funny but warm too. There's plenty of camaraderie between the five friends mixed with the humorous restlessness of a school reunion.

The on location feel gives it an air of realism and captures a current British small town perfectly. Wright once again shows that he's at the top of his game, the action scenes are wonderfully executed and the effects are superb. The soundtrack oozes nostalgia and accompanying music score is fitting. Some jokes my go over some international viewer's heads, but the majority cater for all. 

The first half of the film injects the most one liners and comedy output with the old gang rejoining and their return to the town, while the second is more action orientated when they go head to head with the invaders. The beings glowing eyes are reminiscent of Demons (1985) while the set up feels like Invasion of the Body Snatcher (1956/78) only with a twist and the closing confrontation plays out like an episode of Star Trek/Doctor Who followed by an outlandish flash-forward.

There's plenty of homage's thrown in just for fun, Pegg as washed up excitable alcoholic/drug intoxicated Gary King plays against the usual nice guy, here he's a man you love to hate, you really want him to succeed. Frost is kick-ass lovable. It's strength is that you care about the fate of the characters. The supporting cast are excellent including (surprisingly well cast) Rosamund Pike, Martin Freeman to name a few and a surprise cameo by an ex-Bond.

If Shaun was on the money, and Hot Fuzz was wordy, The World's End is somewhere in between. Highly recommended.

The Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect from Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual style is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A top film just like the others!

After reading so many glowing reviews of this movie, I thought I would be treated to a hysterical comedy. Instead what I found was unfunny, repetitious and rather lame. At least I'm glad to see that some reviewers on this site feel the same way, as I was expecting to be alone on this.

Of course, the plot revolves around the wise-cracking and irresponsible Simon Pegg, as Gary King, trying to reunite his former school buddies to complete the Golden Mile, in Newton Haven, England. It's many years later from when they were in school, and the Golden Mile is a series of 12 pubs in close proximity in the town. Their goal is to be able to drink at all 12 pubs and complete the cycle, something they failed to do years before.

However, one "small" problem emerges when they realize the town has been taken over by robotic aliens, who take human form and are looking to eventually take over Earth. To me, without being too caustic it just seemed like a poor imitation of the classic 1950's film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" Anyway there's lots of talent here aside from Pegg, including Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Nick Frost, and Martin Freeman as Pegg's school chums. Also, the talented Rosamund Pike joins the group as Freeman's sister Sam.

Unfortunately, I felt this talent was wasted in this disappointing and rather overrated film.

The movie-making team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade. With "Shaun of the Dead" (2004) and "Hot Fuzz" (2007), the trio demonstrated originality, ingenuity, and most significantly, capable of drawing a large, appreciative audience. Now they're back with the long-awaited third movie of what's become unofficially known as the "Cornetto trilogy." Like it's predecessors, director Edgar Wright loves paying homage to American cinema; "Shaun" pays its respects to George Romero, "Fuzz" nods its head to over the top action, buddy flicks, and "World's End" takes a page from our classic American sci-fi films.

In "The World's End," 20 years after attempting an epic pub-crawl, five childhood friends reunite when one of them becomes hell-bent on trying the drinking marathon once again. Once convinced to stage an encore by Gary King (Simon Pegg), a 40-year- old man trapped in the mindset of his mid 20's, drags his reluctant friends back to their hometown, and once again attempt to reach the fabled pub - The World's End.

"The World's End" plays on the notion that any time you return to your old stomping grounds, changes are inevitable. Upon returning to their small town rootsa place so boring it boasts about having the first roundabout in all of Englandthe crew notices that things are a little strange. As it turns out, the town residents are now blue- blooded alien robots. Pretty soon, the group of friends find they are not only fighting to recapture who they once were, but to preserve who they are.

"The World's End" follows similar thematic and structural paths as the other films in the trilogy. While it is definitely intended as a satirical spoof on one level, it also works just as well as a fully functional sci-fi story. You have elements of body snatching, invasions, and more than a few overt nods to John Carpenter's classic "They Live" (1998), in the way the aliens integrate into their society and take over. It's satire in such a loving fashion that it comes across as infectiously charming.

If there is anything to criticize here, maybe it's that the genre is a bit more skewered and less defined than in its predecessors. However, "The World's End" does cap an unofficial trilogy, and the grievance is overly critical given the nature of the movies. Long-time fans of the trilogy will appreciate the reversal of roles, casting Pegg as the selfish screw-up, and Frost as the one who has it together. This allows Pegg to fully unleash his gift for gab, and for Frost to show off his considerable skill for physical comedy.

With great gags, better fights, and fan pleasing cameos, "The World's End" is exactly the sort of British-accented, genre-blending pleasure we've come to expect from its creative trio, and we can only anticipate to what the future holds.

I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Shaun of the Dead is almost flawless and though Hot Fuzz is kind of slow and suffers a little from some stupid moments, (not stupid funny, just stupid) it's extremely charming and interesting from start to finish.

The World's End starts off pretty strong, halfway through hits a point that blows your mind to pieces, then pretty much dies.

The biggest problem to me is that the movie suffers from tensionless fight scenes that show the main middle aged drunken characters killing everyone and everything that fights them effortlessly. There was a huge effort put into choreography for martial arts fight scenes, but it instantly sucked the charm out of the movie.

Yes, I know it's a comedy. But Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz worked so well as movies because what was happening (though funny)was actually very tense and realistic. The zombies and townspeople actually posed a threat and they struggled to overcome them. The humor came from people behaving like people in those given situations. The fight scenes in this movie drag for so long and just aren't very interesting (except for the pint spilling joke.)

Also there was a few moments when I just felt they could have written it a bit better. Peter falls behind in the woods and stands there talking to a threatening robot as all of his friends walk away, and this is a long time after they know they are being followed. He dies, and no one really cares. Then near the end the entire town is chasing them and the robots are literally in front and behind them, but yet still don't manage to stop them. And if they're robots wouldn't they have brain power to calculate, record and send what they are doing to one another. How did they manage to lose them? It all just seems like a bad idea for a film. I was really enjoying it until the robot story began.

The final reveal of the movie is also pretty terrible. They literally have to explain it for 5 minutes and it's just stupid and adds more holes and stupidity to the plot.

It definitely had some hilarious moments but for the most part I was just not interested, and the main characters didn't seem to care that their friends were dying and being replaced so why should I.

Worth a watch, but I'll never watch it again.

When you're the third film in an unofficial trilogy that includes Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz then there is a lot of pressure on you to maintain that quality and unfortunately this film doesn't do that. There are good aspects to this comedy but not enough of it really comes together well enough to make it stand up to the previous two films. The plot here sees Gary King trying to reclaim happiness by convincing a group of his friends to revisit the "good old days" by going on a pub crawl they attempted when their lives lay ahead of them and they felt full of potential. However, when they do return to their home they feel like they have changed too much and should never have come back  but they are only half right, because they should not have come back, although it isn't them that has changed.

I like the ideas behind this film. On one hand we have a sci-fi movie which owes its debts to 1950's America while on the other we have a very British plot involving a pub crawl and someone who can't let go of the time in his life where he felt important and potent  a time which has left him behind and now appears a bit pathetic to still be trying to be the person he was rather than just moving on. This is a nice idea and it is one that occasionally goes somewhere but far too frequently it doesn't and it isn't consistently applied. It also doesn't help that Gary himself is a wholly unlikeable character; writing this type of person to work as someone we support is hard and the script never achieves it, it never consistently shows the cracks to the extent that you feel for him. Many of us will have a small part of Gary in us but the film never reaches it. It also doesn't help that the film seems to take his side at the end as well.

This gives us the sci-fi side and it does work better as an all out comedy sci-fi; the fight scenes are silly but yet well done and the action is quite engaging. That said it never feels grounded in the dreary British reality in the way that Hot Fuzz and Shaun managed to do so very well, so while it is decent, it never feels as clever or as special as the previous two films. It does have laughs and the film does have good elements so I don't think it is bad, just that it isn't really anywhere near as successful as it needed to be. The cast are mostly good but the material doesn't make the most of them. Pegg is the lead, has the toughest character and really can't make it work  not all his fault, but still. Nick Frost is better because his character is simpler and he is fun in the action sequences. Marsan, Considine and Freeman are better actors than the material they get given here  likewise the many familiar faces in support, from Brosnan down to Oram, although they do OK.

The World's End is not a bad film and if you liked the previous films then you'll be more likely to find things to enjoy here  but chances are you'll still feel a little disappointed as the aspects that made the previous films work so well don't really come together with this one.

The World's End is about characters who have grown-up but are drawn back into their younger years. Immediately, it seems this is a comparison that can be made with Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in their making of this film.

For me, Gary King (played by Pegg) represents the youthful side of both the film's characters and of Pegg, Frost and Wright; fun, playful, reckless but forgotten and moving away from. However, once coerced into reminiscing, it all comes back.

This is reflected in the film itself which starts off rather slow and dry, and surprisingly, isn't as funny as what it ought to be. So although it does take a bit longer to get going than may be desired, once it does, the laughter flows freely pretty much right through until the end of the film. I have no hesitations in saying it is a funny film.

However, while the laughter is mostly consistent - coming from another fine Pegg and Wright script - the final 10-15 minutes are, in fact, a bit clunky and long-winded despite containing some of the most heartfelt moments of the trilogy.

Nevertheless, it is a joy to see Pegg and Frost on-screen together again. They crack jokes left, right and centre as we are used to but due to Gary and Andy's (Frost) rocky relationship, it's not often with each other. This lack of warmth in their relationship, though a bold change from the previous films, does strain at times and presents a rather unwanted opposite here and there to what we are used to - friends, fun, immature. There are, in effect, 5 leads which does sometimes hinder the Pegg-Frost double-team.

However, since there are 5 leads, this patch is mostly covered up. Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine do an excellent job as King's high-school buddies, the latter in particular - Considine is a gem.

The World's End is the strongest film, thematically, in the Cornetto Trilogy. It's about adulthood vs adolescence, regret, friendship and above all the state of modern society. It does not nod nearly as much towards or satirise genre like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. No, instead the nods and satire are mostly out and the themes are in.

This is half-welcome, half-disappointing for the final film of the trilogy. On one hand, since the other two satirise film genres it is odd the this doesn't and honestly, a bit disappointing. This is much more of it's own beast but, for a Pegg, Wright and Frost film, it does feel far too much of an unexplored area. On the other hand, the concerns of the central plot and the thematic content give the film the strength to round off the trilogy in a fitting and appropriate way.

Furthermore, The World's End contains many of the little recurring elements from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz which show such loving attention to detail and continuity: the Cornettos, the Wright short-shot montages, the fantastic soundtrack, the amazing use of the word 'C**t', the noise of the pub fruit machine, and many other little details that have made appearances in the previous two films are here.

Not only are these recurring details present but so too are some of Wright, Pegg and Frost's collaborators with their own fantastic cameos. I won't give any away specifically but there are actors from previous films in the trilogy and beyond (stretching back to Spaced, here) making appearances and it's actually rather heart-warming. Evidently, roots have not been forgotten.

However, the impressive camera-work of Shaun of the Dead (with it's long, Steadicam tracking shots) and Hot Fuzz (the well-studied and executed shots deriving from the action blockbuster genre) was not as present this time round. In The World's End, the CGI gets in the way too often for the camera-work to shine and this is most apparent in the film's several fight scenes. Fun though they are, they seem off-kilter and as if they have been tinkered with a little too much. Though I don't think it is as adventurous with the camera-work, it is still a fine looking film which I credit with Edgar Wright's choice to continue shooting on film instead of digital. 

Despite what may appear to be a lot of grumbling with The World's End it is still very accomplished and probably one of the better films I will see this year. Is it funny? Certainly, without a doubt. Is it as funny as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? Not quite. And it is the memory and affection for these two films and the frankly unavoidable and inevitable comparisons between them which unintentionally hurt The World's End. 

The influence of these two films, on the other hand - how they got where they are to make this film - has undoubtedly not been forgotten. However, the plot itself and the more heavy thematic content in place of the fun, snappy genre references, give Pegg, Wright and Frost the air of saying that there will always be time to reflect, have fun and cherish the memories of younger, more immature days but that they are older and more mature now and it is time to move on (though I don't wish suggest that they wanted this film done and out the way - a lot of love clearly went into it, as with the whole trilogy). If this is the message we are to be left with, I will say that is a fitting way to end any a trilogy.

A desire for just a little more immaturity and laughter lingers over The World's End nevertheless but it is still a very good film, one I would not hesitate to recommend, and I am forever grateful to Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and the rest of their crew for completing an unforgettable trilogy.

"We're going to see this through to the bitter end. Or... lager end." Gary King (Simon Pegg)

Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are at it again satirizing pop culture, this time with an entertaining send up of zombie movies (even their own spoof, Shaun of the Dead) and boy-man buddy vacations like Hangover. Five middle-aged blokes, led by the perennially immature Gary King (still the "King," he'd like to think), return after 20 years to their hometown to finish the crawl to the 12th and final pub, The World's End.

The obvious allegory is fun to follow as robotic replicas of actual humans try to take over the world. Their mission is to make earth and humans perfect, a goal any lame brain knows is impossible. Aliens have been trying to conquer earth since movies began with little success given our need for independence and ingenuity finding the alien weaknesses.

The real strength of The World's End is in the dialogue with its rapid repartee. For example:

Gary King: And here we go! Just like the five musketeers. Steven Prince: Three musketeers wasn't it? Gary King: Well nobody knows how many there were really do they? Oliver: You do know that The Three Musketeers was a fiction right, written by Alexander Dumas. Gary King: A lot of people are saying that about the bible these days. Steven Prince: What, that it was written by Alexander Dumas. Gary King: Don't be daft, Steve; it was written by Jesus.

Covering authorship and ignorance issues while being amusingly clueless is the endearment of Pegg and Wright's democratic humorafter all, none of the players is exempt from stupidity.

Perhaps more importantly, however, is the thematic point about never being able to go home again. The protagonists grew up in the same town, and returning to finish their crawl reveals that no one remembers them! Of course, since the townies are almost all robots, they couldn't remember them anyway. Yet the point is figuratively well taken: Nobody cares about you after you're gone.

This is by far the funniest and most fun movie of the year; everyone involved is as good as ever. Honestly, this is a movie made by fans, for fans, and the entire theater loved it. I got to see this at a Cornetto Trilogy marathon comprised of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz leading up to the 10:00 PM premiere of the film, and EVERYONE had an incredible time. Everyone. 

First thing's first: is a comedy, so is it funny? FROM START TO FINISH! And, surprisingly, it's actually very heartfelt. The characters are very likable (even if they're rude and belligerent, they have a good side to them) and there is an argument between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost towards the end that was actually very moving. This film never sacrifices a character or plot point to make a joke, just like the other films in this trilogy, and that in itself shows the care here. A lot of movies are just mindless fun, but this is actually smart, and it in turn makes it so much more fun.

Edgar Wright's timing and ability to create terrific fight scenes are as good as ever, and of course Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and all others are just fantastic. And let me say something: these special effects are stellar throughout and it only cost $20 million? Truly well-spent. I just can't wait to see this again.

And note: I am *not* comparing this to Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz (which are my two favorite comedies of all time) because each entry in the Cornetto Trilogy is so different and all of them are truly exceptional. I will, however, compare it to everything else this year and it's the second-best movie of the year behind Stoker.

9.7/10, amazing, two thumbs up, far above average, etc.

A little late with this review. I saw this the weekend it came out but did not have time for a review until now. The world's end marks the third film in Nick and Simon's trilogy. This time around the boys are battling an army of killer robots. Simon and Nick have switched roles for this film in which Simon plays the bumbling idiot. Simon recruits his old high school friends to conquer an epic night of drinking that they failed to do years prior, however now everyone is grown up except for Simon's character who still lives in the past. However they soon realize the town has been taken over by a sinister robot army. 

Basically if you enjoyed either Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz you will love this film. Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of all time so far, however i would rank this movie right up there with Shaun of the dead. The humour in this film is very subtle compared to their previous two films. They try some new things with this film and the result is a crazy mass effect inspired ending. This is a great film to end the summer, and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it will surely be a cult classic in time.

Rating: 8/10

Edgar Wright brings us the final installment of the Cornetto trilogy with his most out-there comedy to date. The World's End is an action-packed, sci-fi comedy where a number of familiar faces return to help Gary King (Simon Pegg) achieve his lifelong dream and complete the 'golden mile' in their hometown of Newton Haven. Five guys, 12 pubs, 60 pints!

I'd written a paragraph about the character's we see from previous films but that'd spoil it a little. You're welcome. I think part of the fun is spotting these for yourself and realising how close knit the cast are... so moving swiftly on!

As you'd expect, the film was cleverly written and it was a lot of fun to watch. However, there's a reference a minute to Edgar Wrights previous work which, for fans, isn't a bad thing, but newcomers to the trilogy will struggle to keep up.

Within the film, there are a number of stories and ideas going on here, but don't let us spoil it for you. The World's End is out now and, for veterans of the trilogy, well worth a watch! 

Nick Frost was a highlight for me, playing a different type of character this time round and for the better. Usually the happy-go-lucky friend, he plays a much more complex and leader type role. With so many other great names in the film, there was a risk that Nick Frost could fall in to the shadow of Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine or Eddie Marsan (who was awesome by the way)... but he doesn't. This is Frost's greatest film yet.

If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, it might be hit or miss so check them out before this... it is the end of a trilogy after all! Watching The World's End first would be like watching Return of the King and, even though they're unrelated, you'll feel left out when everyone starts laughing at a fruit machine playing in the background and you have no idea why.

The film will do well, regardless how good it is - it was a great ending to the trilogy that started almost ten years ago. These have put British cinema on the map. And even though it's a mixed review, (ranging from a 6 to a 9 out of 10)... the golden mile sounds like a great idea - who's up for it? DW.

First off, I'm not going to hold everybody against the wall with a gun at their genitals, asking them to please like this movie or I shoot their freaking balls off. I'm not that that kind of person (and who is anyways). But I want to clear something up here, because I'm getting pretty tired of watching this movie's rating keep on descending here on IMDb, currently holding a 7.1, and on top of that observe all the hilariously stupid hate-arguments people use to shoot this movie down. 

I honestly think people have forgotten how it was like to watch these movies for the first time, and why they found the first two in the series funny in the first place. Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were never as hyped as The World's End was, and I think people expected something else this time around, other than what they were used to from the series... Something bigger, something way beyond Shaun and Hot Fuzz. 

The fact is this IS different, and people tend to not look at the movie in a bigger perspective. All the hidden metaphors and references may be overlooked because all they can think of is: 'well this is basically Shaun of the Dead all over again isn't it" NO it's not. NOT at all. 

I think people need to clear their minds and learn to appreciate good cinema when they see it. I think this got the 'bad-movie' sticker on it WAY too early, and it has become 'that movie to hate' even though it does not deserve that - yes that's my opinion but hear me out here...

It is the 3rd movie in a brilliant series, of course it's hard to live up to. But I dare all of you to see it once more, and look at the unique signature directing style and editing from Mr. Wright, the perfectly timed jokes, and after that look up some analysis of the movie. I'm not saying you are going to like it after a second watch, I'm not saying that you did not get some of the references in the first viewing already either. I'm just saying that people rating this as low as 1 or 2/10 are completely insane. 

Maybe you don't like the concept, fine. Maybe you didn't like the ending, fine. But there has to be HELL OF A LOT wrong with this if you rate it as low as some of the worst movies ever made.

If Hot Fuzz is a 10, Shaun of the Dead a 9, then World's End is an 8. It isn't as brilliant as Hot Fuzz which I can watch time and time again and still need to watch through till the end. It isn't quite as touching or well executed as Shaun of the Dead, though it does have its warming moments.

I'm not entirely sure the end is as good as it could have been.

It is a good end to the trilogy, though. I like how they've switched around the friendship between Pegg and Frost this time, so Pegg is the idiot who's more likely to get himself killed and Frost is the sensible one who cares, too much, in spite of all the let downs. I almost expected it to stay the same and wondered how they'd almost kill Frost this time! 

I've always been a Pegg fan, since Big Train, he can't do much wrong by me. But I've tried to be as critical as possible considering I was so happy just to see the guys back in action. Best thing that could have been released this summer for me and I think any other fan will feel the same.

So last night I went to see this film with a large group of friends and initially had a pretty good time with it. Then I went home and let it sit with me for a little bit, and the more I thought about it, the more my opinion changed. I love the idea of a movie surrounding a pub crawl. It's original, brings out interesting characters, and has a lot of potential for laughs. Especially when it stars people like Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Bilbo Baggins himself, Martin Freeman. Unfortunately that premise is nearly impossible to enjoy because the only character who is really into it is barely likable, making the entire first third of the movie slow and painful. It had some laughs in it but when you're making the followup to Hot Fuzz, you need more than that. The second third of the movie is when the robots come into play and it's here that the movie changes pace for the best part of the movie. The robots, while a very present danger, didn't actually have a direct impact on events. Meanwhile, characters are getting more into it, allowing for a more enjoyable experience. The final third is where things really start to go south, and, I am warning you now, there will be spoilers in what you read next. So basically this is the point in the movie where characters start dying off. But it's not treated as though they are dead. It's treated as though they got fed up with the pub crawl and went home. So when the robots kill someone, they turn their bodies into fertilizer for the ground and create a doppelganger with the same appearance, voice, and memories. And yet people have no problem treating these things exactly like the people they murdered. The fact that the victims die is barely even mentioned throughout the whole film, making it very difficult to maintain any form of connection to any of the characters due to the lack of believability. On top of all this, in the final confrontation scene with the head of the robots, there is a moment where you could have had an epic speech made by Simon that would have actually made sense in the film's narrative. Instead, what follows is Simon's character essentially telling the main villain, who has been killing MILLIONS of people over the course of 10 years, that he is unwilling to submit to him. How does the mass murderer respond? "There's just no reasoning with you, is there?" And then it LEAVES. Millions of people rejecting it over 10 years and its answer is to kill them. But now suddenly it decides that it should leave. Oh, but it leaves the replacements behind. And then the replacements are treated as though they are part of the human race, and are actually openly replacing the people they killed with no complaints from anyone who isn't being portrayed as a prejudiced monster. I would have preferred it if they had stuck to their plan in the second act and gone through all 12 pubs while running from the robots, only to discover the following morning that the whole thing had been a drunken hallucination. You could even still have Simon's epic speech. Some of the characters' back-stories were very sub- par as well in that some characters' back-stories exist for no reason other than to cause their own deaths. Amazingly original premise but it lacks the realism that allows you to care about the characters, which is needed in any survival horror type movie, comedy or otherwise. So even though there was some clever humor in the dialogue, ultimately this film did not meet my expectations. If you are going to watch it, I'd recommend playing it in the background while something else is going on. Oh well, this may have been disappointing, but at least we still have Hot Fuzz!

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are truly passionate comedians and as such, they're of course testing new characters for themselves in every one of their productions. However, just as not every role the legendary Monty Python crew tried out in their sketches worked out to a phenomenal gag, the two talented Britons also have to experience that some of their creations are too exaggerated and weird from time to time. It's just that John Cleese, Graham Chapman et al. represented an innumerable amount of different characters in their day that made a couple of glitches easy to ignore, while Pegg and Frost carry one of those through a full-length film  and then, a one-off doesn't come in very handy.

One of these occurs in The World's End, the duo's sci-fi spoof that features a ton of indulgence in alcohol in addition. In it, Pegg is a dark-haired, arrogant, and alpha male alcoholic stuck in the 90's, while Frost puts on the outfit of a teetotal, contemptuous square that undergoes one of the least believable character changes in film history in the final third. They are assisted by a hardly challenged Martin Freeman (who on earth had the idea that his consistently uttering "WTF?" would be anywhere near funny), a forgettably uninteresting Paddy Considine, and an Eddie Marsan that is to terribly out of place in this film that it physically hurts me. The bundle is topped off by a lovely Rosamund Pike who, just as so many other well-known faces appearing here and there for a cameo, just doesn't have any tangible purpose for being in the picture. I couldn't care less about all that if they had been given witty or just merely amusing stuff to work with, but mostly, that just isn't the case in The World's End, a comedy with an admirable but dull lot of martial arts, head-bashing, and dramatic stand-offs, but a disappointingly small amount of jokes that work.

Exactly as it was with the first two films of the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy this film completes, the gags are a lot better and more frequent in the first half of the whole thing, whereas they make room for seemingly never-ending combat of any kind in the latter part, merely there to give director Edgar Wright some fun in his admittedly creative directing of it. And even though I'm not a fan of that at all, I have to say that I fully enjoyed The World's End during all of its 110 minutes of running time because Wright and his crew managed to make it entertaining despite all its silliness, disproportionality, and lack of big laughs. In the end though, just as money doesn't equal happiness, a good time at the movies doesn't equal a good movie, leading to The World's End being at least better than 2013's other doomsday spoof (how I wish to forget having ever seen This Is the End), but not more than mediocre itself.

The third part of the so-called Cornetto Trilogy by Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Here, Pegg and Frost, along with Eddie Marsan, Martin Freeman and Paddy Considine star as a group of old high school buddies who meet up at around 40 to redo the infamous pub crawl of their home town. The film starts off being about Pegg, a total failure as a human being, trying to recapture his youth. A good half hour in, though, it becomes a sci-fi action/adventure, as the group discovers that their hometown has been overtaken by body snatching robots. Alone with Rosamund Pike (playing Freeman's sister), they continue the pub crawl so as not to arouse suspicion -and so miserable Pegg can finally be a success at something. The film's greatest strength is that it never loses sight of its major theme, even while becoming crazy and silly. It helps a lot that Wright is an absolutely fantastic action director, as he discovered in his previous film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (which is in the running to be my favorite film so far this decade). He's improved as a director tenfold since Hot Fuzz. The film just looks awesome. Now, unfortunately, where it fails is the comedy. That's not to say it isn't funny - it is. I must say, though, that the first half hour, the set-up, is pretty dull. There are a few big laughs, for sure, but, compared to Shawn of the Dead (which is the only one of the Cornetto trilogy - and, Hell, let's include their TV series Spaced, as well - that I have any real love for), it feels like a disappointment. A relative disappointment, of course. I still had plenty of fun with this one.
