### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Let's get one thing straight from the beginning: Waltz With Bashir is an animated documentary. It may sound like a paradox, but hey, when the film played at the Cannes Film Festival (which it left with rave reviews but zero awards) it was inevitably compared to Persepolis, which is an animated autobiography. The comparison was also caused by both movies having open anti-war messages, but they couldn't be more different in concept and execution. They do have one important thing in common, though: they are animated not because it looked good, but because it was the best artistic choice the directors could make.

In the case of Ari Folman, the choice was dictated by the unique angle from which he chose to tell the story: subjectivity. Folman, like many young Israeli men in the '80s, joined the army to fight in Lebanon when he was merely 18 (this was in 1982), thinking he could serve his country in the best way possible. Once the war was over, Folman's new career began, and he is now a successful actor, director and writer (among other things, he worked on the TV show that inspired HBO's In Treatment). However, he still wasn't able to completely get over the war experience, and so he decided to make Waltz With Bashir in order to exorcise his demons, so to speak. In doing so, he delivered one of the strongest, boldest documents about the true nature of conflict.

Folman's introspective journey begins with the lack of memory: apparently, he and many of his fellow soldiers have trouble remembering the exact details of what happened in Lebanon. All they have left is dreams, like the haunting nightmare that opens the movie (26 murderous dogs surrounding the apartment of a former soldier, who believes it to be a subconscious punishment for his killing 26 dogs during a mission) or Folman's eerie flashback of himself and his friends emerging from the water after a massacre he can't (or perhaps doesn't want to) remember. Engaging in a pursuit of the truth, the director locates several people with first-hand recollections of those events, and all these people (minus two) supply their own voices for their animated counterparts.

The stream of personal anecdotes and, as said earlier, dreams, made it impossible for Folman to show real footage of what he was trying to say. After all, how do you show a live-action dream sequence in a documentary without making it look corny? Hence the winning choice of rendering the whole story through animation, with just one exception (the final scene, the one that justifies the film's existence, consists of real filmed material). This gives the picture a feel that is both evocative and down-to-earth, a bizarre but powerful combination that has earned Waltz With Bashir comparisons with the similarly merciless Apocalypse Now. Like few other films about war (Folman has openly stated he despises Hollywood's treatment of the Vietnam conflict, not counting Coppola's masterpiece), this strange, captivating opus depicts it without making it look cool: it's ugly, it's reprehensible, it's the stuff nightmares are made of - not for nothing does it still haunt Folman and his friends.

Journey of self-discovery, cinema as psychoanalysis, a document about the past, a warning for the future: Waltz With Bashir is all those things and much, much more. It's a unique piece of cinema, unmatched in its seamless mixture of raw power and peculiar visual beauty.

Waltz With Bashir is amongst the finest animation films I've seen. It is a very disturbing comment on war and its consequences both on countries and on people of both sides. No doubt this approach has been taken by numerous other film makers; however what sets Waltz With Bashir apart is that it takes a documentary approach and compares Israel's activities in Lebanon with atrocities in the past wars.

Other than documenting events, the film also consists of surreal dream sequences and real life incidents. Thus the film emerges as a unique combination of the real and the unreal. The hand drawn animation also makes it a delight to watch. The colour gave it the right atmosphere of claustrophobia in open spaces and the background score is fabulous.

It is certainly not, as the Director of NZ Film Festival announced before the screening, a 'feel-good film'. It should appeal to people who have an interest in animation, documentaries, war and current affairs. 10 out of 10.

I just came back from watching the movie. I found it interesting and unique. The animation in the film is magnificent and enables the director to really "go wild" with his ideas, without having to be "chained" to what reality filming can give him. The main Character, is on a journey, trying to collect as many memories as he can of the time when he was a young soldier, at war. This journey is so well done, touching, interesting. The man, Ari, slowly revels his past, and we follow him, to an amazing trip down memory lane. Memories that were hidden for too long. An amazing movie that makes you think about life, people, and the complexity of war.

Israeli director Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir is easily the standout film of 2008, with its surreal animation style and abrupt way of portraying such a horrific event. The event being the Sabra and Shatila massacre, in which Palestinian men, women and children were massacred by Christian Phalangists as revenge for the assassination of their leader Bashir Gemayel. The Israelis did not perpetrate the killings but did nothing to stop them, even sending flares into the night sky to assist the Phalangists.

The story follows Ari Folman, who meets a friend in a bar who tells him of the nightmares connected to his experiences from the 1982 Lebanon War. Folman is surprised to find out that he does not remember a thing from the same period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre and does not know if it was real or not. In his memory he and his soldier friends are bathing at night at the seaside of Beirut to the light of flares descending over the city. Folman rushes off to meet another friend from his army service, who advises him to discuss it with other people who were in Beirut at the same time. The film follows Folman in his conversations with a psychologist and reporter Ron Ben-Yishai who was in Beirut at the same time.

There are a few people who need to be congratulated here for their fine efforts in bringing this amazing film to life. David Polonsky, Art Director and Illustrator, along with Director of Animation Yoni Goodman have used a unique style of animation to tell a documentary/war film which shows the futility of war boldly. Although animated, the film features graphic violence and some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen. In particular, a scene showing horses dying in the streets is unflinchingly tragic and another scene showing families being shot is beyond depressing. This movie would probably not have had the same impact if it were not animated.

The music, which features rock, Bach, Chopin, Schubert and an original score by Max Richter adds an incredible amount of depth and emotional impact to the already challenging imagery. The scene from which the title is named after, in which one of Folman's fellow comrades waltzes in the middle of gunfight, firing a heavy machine gun while surrounded by posters of Bashir, is magical as well as mystical.

Waltz with Bashir is truly a must-see film; however, it is so confronting and sad. This is necessary, though, to show the pointlessness of war and the effect it has on people. This is evident in the last seconds of the film, when real footage of the aftermath of the massacre presents dark and graphic views of corpses. You will not leave the cinema happy, but you will leave feeling the power of a piece of art you will not forget anytime soon.

I think working on this movie for 4 years is long enough. You obviously missed the whole point. The point of the movie is not to point the blame at anyone, it is about showing the reality of war and what the affect it has on Soldiers.

It's not about who won, who was right, or who did what wrong. Its about how people react to it and how it affects the people who are involved in it. Yes it showed only the Israeli side of things, but hey, its because it's on the Soldiers point of view, how they saw it, not how everyone saw it, not how the other soldiers. It shows his point view, and the interviewers points of views. Thats why its like this.

And that is why it makes it so real. It is very well done.

Ari Folman first movie was a great promise, but more than a decade passed since then and with only one feature film, and several TV series on the record his career seems to be stagnating at best. Here he comes now with a film that is so sharp, surprising and different - one of the best Israeli films ever in any genre.

Choosing to do an animated feature about the beginning of the first Lebanon war in 1982 and the collective trauma and amnesia caused by this war to its heroes - young soldier torn down from their first world life to be thrown in the violent absurdity of war - and the whole Israeli society is both a daring and natural thing to do. Daring because this film is after all a documentary about the search to the lost memory of the director about his own presence in war, and the journey to recover it by means of interviews with his fellows in arms. The real life persons are recorded while giving the interviews while extremely accurate drawn images play the visual role (one of the persons interviewed is a famous journalist showing up often on TV). As realist as these scenes are, it is hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to bring on screen the fighting scenes, or to play the trauma of the young boys shown into a terrifying and nightmarish reality. So animation was the right and natural choice. Without using special or expensive effects, the dreams and nightmare scenes are both catching and terrifying, reflecting the traumatized souls of the dreamers (one won't forget easily the opening scene).

Yet, the message of the film is far beyond the personal message. When dreams (or better said nightmares) dissipate the deep-buried reality gets back - the massacres in the Palestinian camps become real on screen, and this is the only place where Folman uses fragments of filmed material rather than animation. The nightmare became reality and its a grim one. Without ever leaving the personal and emotional plans, the political statement about a war with no winners is made loud and clear without the need of being explicit.

Animation is not just for children - the French "Persepolis" (about a girl in Iran) made that clear and the Israeli "Waltz With Bashir" (about the invasion of Lebanon) dramatically underlines the point. The Israeli work was written , produced and directed by Ari Folman and is based on his experiences as a soldier and his video of his exploration of the traumatic events some 20 years later. Like any really powerful film, the opening and closing sequences are stunning - but the intervening one and half hours contain so many moving and disturbing images - some simply surreal - that the animation plays in the mind long after the credits have rolled.

The title is a reference to Bashir Gemayel, the newly appointed President of Lebanon, who was assassinated on 14 September 1982 following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon on 6 June 1982. The assassination led the Israeli command to authorise the entrance of a force of approximately 150 Phalangist fighters into the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, resulting in a massacre of at least 800 civilians. It is this horrific incident that is the emotional heart of the movie and the cause of Folman's mental repression.

I saw this film at the AFI Film Festival a couple of months ago and it stayed with me since then. This is not your typical war movie, nor is it your typical animated film. I'd say its kind of a cross between Waking Life and Grave of the Fireflies.

The film takes place in the present. The film's director, Ari Folman, comes to the realization that he cannot remember anything from the time he served in the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. The bulk of the movie are his interviews with his old army friends where he asks them what they remember from that time. Folman tries to see in their memories something in himself that has been missing, deadened, or dulled. Like Waking Life, there is no "plot." The filmmaker prefers a more interview-based film. This is an "idea film," a poetic film, and traditional narrative style takes a back seat.

Like Grave of the Fireflies, the animation in Waltz With Bashir shows the horror of war and its effect on individuals in ways that a live action recreation could never replicate. The film's themes of human memory and its elasticity are served well by this technique. Rather than a soldier escaping death by hiding in the sea, we get the larger-than-life memory of a soldier escaping death that would look too "real" in a live action reenactment.

Waltz with Bashir may not deliver everything you expect after seeing the trailers, but it is powerful. Director Ari Folman presents a personal view of historic events in which he took part as a young soldier, but which he cannot remember due to repression. A full-length documentary, filmed with animation over the recorded speech of actual participants in the 1982 Lebannon War, Waltz with Bashir is beautifully done and get its message across clearly.

It's a shame that some of the stronger artistic points in the movie were left undeveloped, such as the imaginary ghost of the soldier's ex-girlfriend following him around (as seen in the trailer). The way comedy and tragedy are interspersed in the latter parts of the film may also seem inappropriate to some viewers. The film presents a highly personal point of view for a documentary, justified partly by staying true to the factual material, and partly by its author having been there on the scene.

Overall, despite its shortcomings, this film makes a strong statement and is definitely worth seeing for its visuals and score.

If you're expecting the standard action anime think again. Starting with the pack of snarling rampaging dogs that opens the action, this is one of the most powerful films I've seen, quite shocking, and the technical switch to real news footage at the end brought me as close as I've ever been to throwing up in a movie theatre. You'll see what I mean. The surrealistic power of animation is fully exploited in the dream sequences and flashbacks of this story which at one level is a psychological exploration of traumatic memory. But the film goes far beyond the personal and delves into a particularly nasty few days of the Israeli occupation of Beirut in 1982 involving an unholy collusion with, as I said, gut-wrenching results for humanity.

Will this win further enemies for Israel as one of the reviewers said? I hope not, and the courage of the film's official Israeli backers is appreciated. What the film shows is that we all, Nazi and Jew, Muslim and Christian, smart and stupid, are capable of some pretty inhuman behaviour if we allow ourselves.

This film exists on several levels. It is partly a film about combat trauma, memory and repression, partly about the specifics of Israel's role in the Lebanese civil war, and partly about war in general as experienced by soldiers. It was cleverly constructed, moving back and forth from the middle-aged protagonist and his search for his lost memories via contacting old comrades, and the depiction of the actual events during the time of his and their youth. The film is mostly done in animation and uses animation in a very effective way.

I do not believe it is at all relevant what someone's political opinions are in terms of appreciating this film. The film reveals truth through taking the viewer on a journey to the past through the memories of people who witnessed the worst days of the conflict.

Waltz with bashir is something that is hard to forget, while the images grab you first it is the wonderful story and direction here that keeps things at a high level.While the flashback scenes are much better then the real time stuff, there is really no flaw to this film for 90 minutes and that is really saying something in today's film world where perfection is low.I wouldn't say this movie is the best of the year by far, but it could be argued and the movie has some of the most wonderful scenes I have seen in any film including a waltz with gunfire that is oh so memorable.Or the iconic image of men in the ocean looking to the sky, the soundtrack is wonderful with music from Bach and you really feel like there was good writers, directors and producers on this whole thing that made it moving, original and something to really spend some time watching.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185616/ Released in the UK now. Limited US release on the 25th of Dec.

It's rare that I usually leave the cinema speechless, before engaging in hours (literally) of discussion with those around me, but 'Waltz With Bashir' is no ordinary film for no ordinary audience. Emotionally enthralling, yet uneasily shocking, 'Bashir' follows director Ari Goldman as he visits various friends and foes trying to rekindle the memories he has forgotten of the Israeli-Lebanon War in 1982. Shot in memorizing animated visuals, it is a thought-provoking ride through the rediscovery of one man's forgotten nightmares.

From the opening surrealist shot of twenty-six dogs rabidly racing down the Tel Aviv streets towards the 'dreamers' (Ari's friend) home, to the ending where the animation is sacrificed for a few short minutes to show the real, unaltered horrors of the Sabra and Shatila massacre from news reels and archive footage. Surrealism is constantly mixed with the truth, making you wonder, what did Ari really want to find out and to what end? Is this all he and those remembered, or what there memories would allow them to keep encapsulated.

A frighteningly stark look at a young soldiers life, and how war can effect everybody involved, not just those remembered as a statistic on a board of casualties. As we delve further into his regained memories, we are made to wonder, is this journey exercising his demons, or simply just reigniting them? With the stunning visuals keeping you emotionally at arms length, detracting you from the events, before quickly dragging you back in with a horrifically haunting ending.

'Waltz With Bashir' is compelling, thought-provoking viewing.

The only movie in the past few years that even comes close to it's power is 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days. But I would have to say even that film pales somewhat in comparison with Bashir. Because Waltz with Bashir is not only emotionally devastating, it also opens one up like a can of beans. It makes most other war films look silly and fake. 

On top of all that, it is the first film of it's kind. A graphic novel come to life, that is also a documentary. 

Astounding.

The art work is wonderful. The calm tone of the film is soothing and also wrenching.

You will cry. A lot.

Although I saw it last night I am still unsure of my reaction to "Waltz with Bashir". I'm still digesting the film, attempting to understand more about it, still wondering if I found it remarkable or disappointing, if I thought its moral sensibilities were sound or superficially apologetic. Perhaps the ultimate irony in the film is that its main themes are those of willful ignorance and of amnesia, or willing repression of memories by the Israeli soldiers on whom the film focuses, but, as pointed out by the great film critic Joumane Chahine (who loved the film) in Film Comment: "It's not that Folman minimizes Israel's complicity in the events, the IDF's logistical involvement has long been a matter of record... The film's more individual perspective justifies circumventing the matter. But the film's discreet arrogance is that, in contrast, it confronts head-on the brutality of the Lebanese Christian Phalanges who perpetrated the butchery. And while the Arabs' treatment of their Palestinian 'brethren' has hardly been exemplary, there is something particularly distasteful- somehow akin to watching a German film about Vichy France's treatment of Jews during World War II- about being lectured on this by the Israelis."

I did find this attitude highly ironic. The Israeli soldiers, the men he actually knew, are all, bar none (except for defence minister Ariel Sharon, who unquestionably was responsible at least in part for the proved massacre of anywhere between two to three and half thousand civilians of all ages and genders, and his presence also ties in with the theme of amnesia- after the massacre hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in protest of the IDF's involvement thanks to Sharon's decisions, but many years later they allowed him to become Prime Minister), sweet, good, morally perfect people. Yet the Christians are portrayed almost literally as dogs. Inhuman, brutal, violent, sick, and fetishistic with regard to their leader. The film makes a huge deal about the dead children and older men and women the soldiers saw in the camps, but Ari Folman doesn't even seem to think about the women, children, and seniors killed in air strikes and even ground initiatives by the IDF during the same war. Somehow, only what the Arab Christians did is truly horrifying. A little hypocrisy at play, or is it a matter of even more suppressed memories? 

All that said, I still found the film affecting, and its technical merits are unquestionably outstanding. The animation is gorgeous, the music even more special, and the film is a remarkable, rare exploration of how the guilt and pain these men feel to this day haunts them. It's not new subject matter, but the specifics of this film make it unique, that it focuses on the IDF's involvement in one of the most heinous massacres of the late twentieth century, and moreover that it focuses on involvement by young men who wouldn't have even been sure of what exactly was happening. The film's psychoanalytic approach (it is an 'animated documentary', but I suspect much of it was written, although I'm sure those interviewed were definitely quoted truthfully at many points, but what they say is a little too conveniently attached to the film's themes) is not always successful, and sometimes painfully obvious and tired ("You weren't thinking of these camps, but those camps" or "Unwillingly, you had stepped into the shoes of a Nazi"). Still, the imagery and music, as well as the genuine sincerity and honesty of the film (as well as its subjectivity) make it worthwhile viewing. It's extremely well-crafted and for the most part psychologically interesting, that much is for sure. It's also worth noting that the controversial ending worked for this viewer. Not cheap, not exploitative, but only a stark, brutal reminder of just how real it was.

Nothing short of the best war movie that I've seen in a very long time, Waltz touches a deep nerve of truth, not unlike The Deerhunter did, despite also non-contradictorily engaging the fluidity and uncertainty of memory and identity as both a means to that truth as well as some of its content. This is quite an accomplishment. Its vulnerable embracement of that epistemological difficulty is perhaps what's most admirable about the film. And its striking formal innovations are organic to that journey, drawing it out. Persepolis is quite a good film, but it cannot claim an equivalently rich multidimensionality.

Surely a flashpoint, which likely hinders certain award winning, the film is compatible with an intersubjectivity of certain truths although it takes a definitive position on some of them. Purveyors of near-absolute cultural relativism or wobbly moral equivalency will accuse it of monologue, and hence internal contradiction. Others who hide behind false dichotomies and subordinate omissions to acts or individual obligation to collective responsibility will accuse it of self-flagellation. In any event, it's a film that compels dialogue. To me, it's an interrogator of brutal truths.

Sometimes the only way to deal, or at least come to terms with, something inhuman and inescapable like experiences in combat can be through abstraction. When faced with the memories of such things, I can only personally imagine as someone who's never been shot at repeatedly or shot repeatedly at others as a soldier, memory remains, but sometimes not always intact or with things blocked. Waltz with Bashir is the best war film I've seen in however long I can recall to face up to the fact that people in war have to live with themselves decades after any conflict ends- such as Israel and Lebanon in Beirut in the early 80s- and that a person's own demons are tantamount to the devastation they might see or possibly connect to with the "other".

In this case Israel and Palestine, once again a topic that will make some see the film even without really knowing what it's about. Many will be surprised; it's an original hybrid, maybe the most original to use rotoscoping since Waking Life and with the same power of those Gerald Scarfe animated war-scenes in Pink Floyd's the Wall, and at the same time a documentary. The director himself is the subject, at least in part, as Ari Folman goes around to people who he fought with or may have known or knew fought in the Lebanon war, and he tries to figure out what else he may have seen of a massacre which only a piece of a hallucination-cum-memory, where he rises out of a beach and puts on clothes with two other soldiers, remains elusive.

What do the other ex-soldiers have to say or reminisce about? Usually about some painful or just some strange experiences that can only be told from the horses' collective mouths. A vision of a naked woman ascending onto a boat to comfort a nauseated soldier who later swims across a sea back to his fellow soldier; another who is in a trench against unseen snipers in tall buildings who forces his way to use another gun so that he can do a "waltz" of the title while firing; another soldier describes seeing a field of destruction and bodies as if in "an LSD trip". And all the while Folman drifts in and out trying to piece things together, sometimes telling of before and after the war (trying to get a girl he lost back with no luck) or just seeing apocalyptic visions like bombed planes at an airport with no one in sight. Every story mounts to something more and more devastating, and as we learn more about Folman and his background- parents survived Auschwitz- we can start to realize his completely unconscious guilt about a massacre that occurred that technically the Israelis had no 'direct' involvement in (it was ultimately Christian soldiers who killed the masses of people in Beirut, but it was given the 'whatever' pass by the Israeli troops).

But it would be just one thing if this were just a documentary charting memory of wartime, or another if one were to learn more about a conflict that isn't quite as well known to the casual observer of Israeli-Palestinian-Lebanon military conflicts (and there's no lack of them sad to say). Either of these could make splendid and harrowing pieces of non-fiction, but the animation elevates it so something else. Folman knows some of this is so painful and haunting and shocking, if only for himself if not also for the audience (and it is), that the only way to sift through it and come to grips with it is to see it played out, dramatically, in another medium. The animation is not always "trippy" like a Linklater picture, but some of it is truly astounding "trippy" animation, with visions and dreams and memories put together, with the occasional funny scene (i.e. "fast-forward" through the porno tape) that work far greater in animation than it would in live action.

It provides a freedom of expression, possibilities, but it serves an emotional and even moral context. As animation that is *not* for the kiddies (i.e. Persepolis, Linklater's films) can show time and time again, when given the chance or slips through the kiddie-tested waters, another level of expression can hit an audience with colors and vibrancy and mixtures that come closer to how a mind sometimes sees things, if in this case tragically in retrospect. And yet, by the end of Folman's great film, there's a shot that zooms through the crying masses of Palestinian women to the face of Folmans, and then to some actual footage from 1982 at the camp following the devastation. Sometimes you need cold, hard facts, sometimes just a memory, and sometimes it's so unreal as to believe even happened. Waltz with Bashir deals with all of these things with a scope that is nothing less than moving and appropriately jarring. A+

Yes, I'm a Jew (an atheist Jew) from Israel. When this movie was released in theaters, I was about 11 years old, and I didn't want to see this film (I can't remember why). Ever since, I've heard many news and reviews and stories about the success this film got worldwide, especially in Israel, and yet- I never watched it. This week I decided to give this film a try- I finally wanted to know the reason for it's success. I just finished watching it, and now I understand exactly what I missed- the best Israeli film ever. The animation is unique and excellent, the story is interesting and was told spectacularly, the dialog is absolutely great, fast and well- paced movie, the opening scene is just brilliant, a great history lesson about one of Israel's famous wars, there was a lot of comedy and humor (to my surprise) which was handled and presented fantastically, the drama is also intense and well handled, can be a little harsh at times but there aren't many harsh and hard-to-watch scenes. Overall, great film, definitely the best movie ever came out from Israel, and like I said before- fantastically-told story and a great history lesson if you're learning about Israel's war with Lebanon.

I believe this is the 3rd or 4th time I'm watching this film. Haven't watched it in a very long time.

I'm not a big fan of our cinema here in Israel, but this film is just brilliant. Definitely on the top 10 and one of the best animations ever made. This is a combination of excellent direction, excellent score (and sound editing), excellent animation and great story telling (I'd say "writing", but I'm not sure how much was written and how much is from real interviews).

The movie tells stories of the Lebanon war from the eyes of different Israeli soldiers. It's an anti-war movie and like many Israeli movies that succeed in Europe, it's very left-wing. Still, it's an amazing film, showing the chaos of war and the sad moments. It's mostly moving because you know and feel the stories are real.

An Israeli film director interviews fellow veterans of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon to reconstruct his own memories of his term of service in that conflict.

indieWire named the film the tenth best of the year, based on the site's annual survey of 100 film critics. Xan Brooks of The Guardian called it "an extraordinary, harrowing, provocative picture." The film was praised for "inventing a new cinematographic language" at the Tokyo Filmex festival. Despite the positive critical reception, the film was only moderately commercially successful in Israel itself.

I love the way this is animated. Similar to rotoscope, but less awkward looking. And it takes a very serious, dangerous, and deadly historical note and makes it palatable by having it be these people recount their memories and be animated, so it does not have that harsh reality.

WALTZ WITH BASHIR got one thing right. When it comes to compulsive self criticism, Jews and Israel can't be beat.

If I had just dropped in from Mars with little knowledge of world history, and my first history lesson was WALTZ WITH BASHIR, I'd assume that Israel was an immoral miscreant for trying to defend itself against a particular ideology that delights in killing Jews. For example, on March 11, 1978, the PLO crossed from Lebanon into Israel, hijacked two buses, and murdered 37 people in cold blood, mostly kids. During the course of Arafat's adventures in Lebanon, the PLO murdered thousands of Christians, conducted terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and according to the U.N., violated 270 documented cease fire agreements. These little facts, including any reference to terrorists, Fatah, the PLO, or endemic Jew-hatred in the Middle East were conspicuously absent from the movie.

Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon suffered approximately 200,000 civilian fatalities in a series of running conflicts involving Muslims vs. Christians, Syrians vs. Christians, the PLO vs. both Jews and Christians and the U.S. Marines getting hammered in Beirut. The number of civilians killed by the IDF was a small fraction of this number. One major point that the movie failed to point out is that the government of Lebanon INVITED the Israelis into Lebanon to help them get rid of the PLO, which the IDF eventually succeeded in doing. Part of the deal was to allow Arafat and his thugs to escape to Tunisia where Arafat could spend his days dreaming of dead Jews and basking in the glow of his European and Arab sycophants. Then, in 1993, under the Oslo Accords, Jewish guilt plus temporary insanity caused Israel to invite Arafat and the PLO back to the West Bank. Big Mistake! Let's not forget that when Israel REALLY occupied the West Bank, and not just 1.7% as it does today, Israel built Palestinian Universities, roads, hospitals and the life expectancy of West Bank Palestinians went from 44 to 67 years of age! The movie gives the impression that Beirut was utterly destroyed by the IDF. In fact, Beirut was largely in ruins due to Christian Phalange attacks against Palestinian positions well before the IDF arrived. It is true that the IDF shelled and bombed buildings and allegedly killed several thousand civilians in an effort to destroy the PLO and related Palestinian terrorists. This really got Europe and the U.N. upset because they believe that Jews should not be allowed to defend themselves unless they can absolutely guarantee that there will be no collateral damage. Of course, the movie completely ignored the factors that compelled Israel to enter Lebanon in the first place. History reveals that Europe and the U.N. were complacent, not only when the PLO terrorized Israel, but both Europe and the U.N. failed to mount any meaningful protest after the PLO murdered, raped and tortured the Christian residents of Damur. Just as irritating is the fact that Europeans, who are in no position to criticize Jews, are probably unaware that Palestinian Muslims have been killing Palestinian Jews long before Israeli statehood in 1948. Does Haj Amin al-Husseini and the Muslim Brotherhood ring a bell? Probably not.

The final scene in the movie shows the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila. These camps, in fact they are cities, became headquarters for the PLO. NOTE: WHY ARE THERE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE FIRST PLACE? Some 800,000 Jews were driven out of Arab countries between 1948 and 1950, and most of them were successfully integrated into Israeli society. Why haven't Muslims accepted the Palestinians as equal citizens in any of their numerous nations? In any case, the IDF agreed to let the Christian militias go into the camps and drive out the PLO. The militias went crazy and took revenge on the Palestinians for murdering their families. During the siege of the camps, some members of the IDF suspected that Palestinian civilians were being killed, but they didn't do enough to stop it. In fact, the only recourse for the IDF would have been to go into the camps and start killing their Christian allies. In the end, after all the suffering caused by the PLO, the only thing that the world remembers is the Israeli connection to Sabra and Chatila.

Also, the movie makes the IDF out to be the most inept, corrupt, perverted fighting force in existence. One wonders how the IDF managed to win all its wars while receiving absolutely no American military aid during two of its most difficult defensive wars - Israel's War of Independence and the 1967, Six Day War?

Boaz is haunted by 26 dogs chasing him. As an Israeli soldier fighting in Lebanon, his job is to take out the dogs since he's unable to kill people. Ari Folman has blocked out many memories from his days fighting there. Boaz's story has waken something in his brain. He starts searching for his past by talking to old comrades about their time in Lebanon and discover the truth about what happened in Beirut.

This is a harrowing animated historical recounting of a devastating incident and a devastating war. The war stories are as powerful as any of the great anti-war movies. It takes apart a war, memories and a massacre. It is a powerful movie.

'Waltz with Bashir' is an animated documentary written and directed by Ari Folman. The film follows Folman in his search for his lost memories from the time when he served in the Israeli army during the traumatic Lebanon War of 1982.

The first thing that I realised while watching 'Waltz with Bashir' is the fact that the animation was absolutely indispensable and this film could never have been made in any other possible way. This is because although this is at the basic level a documentary, but Folman takes a lot of artistic liberty to recreate the real life events and these recreations would never have been possible without the medium of animation. So the animation actually enhances and assists Folman's storytelling instead of sticking out as a gimmick. Thanks to the meticulous animation and the visual attention to detail, the whole film looks gorgeous. Every still shot can be framed and laminated to admire the beauty that is on show. The surreal imagery of the animation will stay with me for a long, long time. Folman uses the animation to juxtapose the beauty of the visuals with the devastating nature of the events during the war that the visuals were capturing. There are multiple haunting images and shots which are devastating to watch like certain scenes in 'Schindler's List'.

The screenplay for the film and the subject is deep and thematically rich. Although Folman never shies away from the heavy nature of the subject matter, but Folman's style keeps the film vibrant and energetic throughout. Even viewers who generally tend to avoid war films will find this engrossing.

The primary themes running through the film are the loss of innocence and guilt. We see Folman interview other men who like him served in the Lebanon War. We see these men recall the horrors of war that they had to witness when they were just young boys pushed into this hellish environment. Pretty much all the stories and interviews are interconnected. All the stories underline the madness and the futility of war. The stories also establish the mental struggles that these war veterans have had to deal with after coming back. The singular element that connects these mental issues of most of these men is the element of guilt. The guilt of having to kill human beings and also the guilt of surviving the war when many of their colleagues couldn't. Water bodies like the ocean play an important and symbolic role in many of their stories. Folman uses this aforementioned theme of guilt very craftily and uses it to connect the issues concerning the nation of Israel as a whole in the political scenario with the personal issues troubling the individuals covered in this film.

Another very relevant theme dealt with by Ari Folman is the dynamic nature of memories. He explores and establishes that someone's memories can be fabricated by others or by himself/herself. A person can choose to completely forget certain aspects of his/her life because of certain subconscious assumptions. 

'Waltz with Bashir' is an artistic masterpiece. Its substance and style go hand in hand and complement each other instead of one submerging the other. It is a political film that is ambitious in its style and becomes more than just about politics and war. It becomes a transcendental work about human emotions.

I am usually rating movies based on their genre. Since there are few animated documentaries around, this by itself would place Vals Im Bashir pretty high, but while I was trying to find flaws in the film, I realized that I am having difficulty doing that. Perhaps the only one that makes sense is that the animation is very basic, Adobe Flash like, other than that, it is something that touches on both factual and emotional level, without being heavy handed.

To put it in perspective, it is the story of an Israeli man trying to understand why he forgot what happened during the war in Lebanon and his journey to remembering. It is not a propaganda film, but a personal documentary film of the director's journey: the man in the film.

I can only recommend it.

I can honestly say that I've never seen anything quite like WALTZ WITH BASHIR before. It's animated, but it's also a documentary which recounts director Ari Folman's attempt to reclaim long-suppressed memories of his involvement in the Lebanon War. The animation-documentary combination is an odd one, but nevertheless it works extraordinarily well with what the filmmakers seemed to be going for here. Although it mostly deals with firsthand war experiences, the larger theme is the subjective and fragile nature of memory, particularly of the traumatic and painful variety. I don't really want to get into any specifics because to do so would spoil the impact. All I'll say is that this film builds rather slowly as different people are interviewed and details are revealed, and the climax is sure to provoke an emotional reaction. As far as the quality of the film is concerned, the animation is very well-done. The movement is a little odd at times, but this is due to them either using cut-outs or roto-scoping (maybe a combination of both?). I'm fairly certain that the interview scenes were based on actual film footage, but I could be wrong. The sequences in the past are distinguished from the present by having this watercolor-like, washed-out, yellow-tinged and dingy look, while the scenes in the present have more natural-looking color. Back to thematic content, there is also some discussion about dreams and how they relate to memory. And of course, since this film deals with a war (and massacre) issues of morality come up, if in a more subtle way than you might think. What I took away from this is that the Lebanon War (and Palestinian massacre) is something that weighs heavy on the Israeli/Jewish conscience. We as human beings tend to block out things from our memories that we find offensive and overly traumatic, and there probably is some cognitive dissonance between the very real atrocities visited on Jews in the past and the atrocities that they have inflicted, or at least passively observed being inflicted, on others. It should go without saying that this film deals with some very heavy subject matter, but it's very important that we as human beings are able to confront and deal with all memories, even the ones we'd like to forget.
