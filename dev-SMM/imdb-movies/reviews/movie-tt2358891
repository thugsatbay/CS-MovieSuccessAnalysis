### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Italian cinema is, at last, on a roll again. Perhaps not in the same way as when Rossellini, Visconti, Fellini and De Sica were batting masterpiece after masterpiece into the arena but maybe more prodigiously than at any time since the young Olmi and young Bertolucci were setting the screen alight. In recent years we have had Michelangelo Frammartino's "Le Quattro Volte", Gianni De Gregorio's sublimely gentle comedies "Mid-August Lunch" and "The Salt of Life" and, perhaps best of all, the films of Paolo Sorrentino whose "The Consequences of Love", "The Family Friend" and "Il Divo" were highly original and sufficiently off-the-wall to invite comparisons with Fellini. His one venture into English-language cinema, "This Must be the Place", met with a largely hostile reception from critics who accused him of being self-indulgent but I found the film to be gorgeous and quirky and just what I would have expected from so idiosyncratic a talent. And now we have "The Great Beauty", a return to Italy and a return to, what his critics might see as, earlier form.

This film, too, has been compared to Fellini which is entirely appropriate as this is a "La Dolce Vita" for the 21st century. You can even imagine the film's central character, Jeb, as Marcello, older if hardly wiser and for Sorrentino nothing much has changed. But if this is Sorrentino in Fellini mode it's just as close to the beauty and spectacle of "Amarcord" or, more appropriately, "Juliet of the Spirits". Once again the lead is taken by Toni Servillo, who was Sorrentino's Andreotti in "Il Divo" and once again he confirms his position as one of the cinema's finest actors, heading a truly superb ensemble cast. 

As in "La Dolce Vita" there is no real 'story' but rather a series of episodes in the life of Jeb in the days following his 65th birthday, (his birthday party is the first of the film's many great sequences). If there is a theme it's Jeb's increasing disillusionment with the lifestyle he has associated himself with over the years, a lifestyle he is very reluctant to give up, no matter how pragmatically he views it. He is a man who has had many women but no real relationship to speak of, (the early love of his life married someone else). He meets the daughter of an old friend, a 42 year old stripper with a drug habit, and they strike up a relationship of sorts though when they go to bed together he is happy when they don't have sex. He gets sustenance from his friends although he can be cutting and abrasive in their presence. It seems as it is they, and not money or power, which keeps him going.

This is a magnificent movie, the kind of film that you know is being composed, frame by gorgeous frame, by a master film-maker. It is a breathtaking melange of sound and images, of great performances and superlative dialogue that draws you in and holds you from its first shot to its last. Some directors open their films with great tracking shots but Sorrentino saves his to the end, up, over and under the bridges of the Tiber as the final credits roll. Don't leave the cinema to the very last second.

This movie's title means "The Big Beauty", and the story is set in Rome. Of course, the city is prominently featured, so much and so long that it makes you think that "Rome" could be probably credited among the actors, at least for a supporting role, as "herself". But buyer beware (or, to appropriately use the Latin, Caveat Emptor): this is not a film about the beauty of the immortal city. In a nutshell, I would say that this movie is about the constant research of beauty and meaning in life by an aging intellectual named Jep. I am sure I won't give away too much if I say that, eventually, he will became aware that the beauty in his life is not in Rome  heck, it's not even in the present: poor Jep has been searching for so long in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.

Somebody could be annoyed by the fact that nobody in the movie seems never to do any kind of work at all -- curiously enough, the only self-proclaimed hardworking man happens to be a very seriously-looking international criminal! But for most of the other characters, money looks more like a cause, than a consequence of life. Without the restraints of needs, left with no practical excuses for not being happy, they still accomplish somehow the no small feat of spoiling their lives with various forms of suffering and pain. 

The story is wonderfully told both by images and dialogues. It takes some kind of "magic realism" turn towards the end  but that's balanced by the steadily cynic tone of the stream of consciousness coming out from Jep, wandering around the city like Marlowe in Los Angeles. Paolo Sorrentino is a writer, too: he has written a couple of enjoyable books starring a character very similar to the one depicted in the movie, a cold bastard bon vivant with a surprisingly soft heart. Mr. Toni Servillo provides flesh, and bone, and looks, and wit for this character. Just another major performance from the greatest Italian living actor: at the end of the movie it leaves into the audience the clear idea to have actually known a real person, not just a fictional one. The whole supporting cast is great, and very well-picked. A special mention goes to Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, two very famous actors in Italy, shining here in two supporting roles where both of them display their undisputed talent.

This film is a modern masterpiece of Cinema. Luca Bigazzi's cinematography is beautiful, with elegant tracking shots of Rome that draw the viewer into the loveliness of Jep's world (even if age and experience seems to have robbed him of the ability to feel and see this great beauty himself). 

The enchanting score of choral works by David Lang (I Lie), Vladimir Martynov (The Beatitudes), John Tavener (The Lamb) and Arvo Part (My Heart is in the Highlands) give depth to the wonderful images of Rome. This haunting soundtrack replaces the need for dialogue and adds intensity to Servillo's melancholic performance.

Servillo's acting is superb from his moments of dry humour to the heartbreaking intensity of those feelings he cannot quite hold on to. 

La Grande Bellezza gives a window into Roman life that is probably only fully understood by a fellow Roman. However all can appreciate the aesthetic pleasure of Sorrentino's Rome and the bittersweet meanderings of its characters. 

This is a cinema of the highest order, imbued with elegance & style. For the viewer it is like swimming in honey. Grazie Signore Sorrentino.

Deep and elegant mental decadence in nowadays Rome. I did love so much this film, it reminds me some old classic Italian movies. Watching the movie I thought about Marcello Mastroianni, it could have been the perfect actor for this film if this was his movies era. But do not misunderstand me, Toni Servillo is in my opinion the best actor for this movie. Locations are decadent and superb. What I liked so much about this movie is also the rhythm, the pauses and all the surrounding characters that give sense to the whole decadent plot. When the movie ended, I and other people stood up and watched the screen silently. This is a movie that lasts in your mind for a long time. As sadness and emptiness are perfectly mixed in the main character with poetry and sincere joie di vivre, all surrounded with astonishing and unusual views of Rome.

I had to go to see this movie twice in a row as the first time was not enough: I was literally overwhelmed by it like the Japanese tourist at the beginning of the movie.

The movie is about Rome, about true love, about decadence, about difficulty of communicating, about values.

But the most important subject is life itself and how to live without having regrets.

Many word have been spent about Sorrentino talent, so I am not going to talk about it: he is without doubts one of the most talented directors alive (and surely the best Italian).

The great beauty is well written, dialogues are intelligent and philosophic, really good food for thoughts.

The character are perfectly described and very, very well played (Toni Servillo is not a surprise because we knew him from The consequences of love and Il divo), but other actors like Sabrina Ferilli and Carlo Verdone, they have been a nice discover indeed.

You will leave the theatre with the awareness you have seen a masterpiece.

Highly recommended

This lengthy (142mins) intriguing, complex movie follows the reflections of former novelist, Jem Gambardella (Toni Servillo), as he contemplates his past and current life, a life, it would appear, of lost opportunities both personal and professional. 

As a member of the wealthy elite of Roman society, he participates in their empty pastimes; parties fuelled with drink and drugs, bizarre art events and casual sexual encounters with beautiful but soulless women. Gambardella is both participant and observer, watching himself as much as his associates, mysterious animals trapped in the gilded cage that is Rome with all the stunning beauty of its architecture, fountains, sculptures, and paintings. 

We are shown a funeral where Gambradella acts out the etiquette he has just been describing to us; a dinner with a cardinal who seems more interested in food than faith; a saintly nun of extreme age mounting a stone staircase on her knees and crawling painfully onwards and upwards towards an image of Christ . . . Everywhere, life presents contradictions, material and spiritual, emotional pretence and genuine feeling, the Eternal City and its mortal inhabitants, . . .

If all this sounds too heavy, everything is carried along by a welter of gorgeous images complemented by music that varies from the ethereal to hefty thumping dance beats. And the actors' performances are never less than utterly convincing.

At one of the parties as the massed participants enter into yet another conga-style dance, Gambardella remarks that 'we have the best trains in Rome because they don't go anywhere.' Everything comes back to where it starts and ends where it began. So in the long final credits sequence we float languidly beneath the bridges of Rome, left to contemplate the setting in which we first encountered the genial but disillusioned Gambardella. 

This is an sumptuous, sensuous, fascinating movie which for me at least probably needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate. Don't miss it!

The Great Beauty is such an unusual concoction of sights and sounds, it's a wonder it works at all. Watching it is like seeing a walking bicycle and realizing, to your amazement, that one can actually ride it.

The movie follows Jep Gambardella, the king of Rome's night life. Jep came to Rome in his twenties, after having written a very promising novel, but 40 years later he is settled as a journalist for a high-class literary magazine. Jep has friends, who are just as frustrated and unsatisfied with their lives as he is, despite having all their red Ferraris and high-rise condos. Together they keep each other company and form a support group of sorts. The presence of other miserable people convinces them it's OK, the life is still worth living and facade is still worth maintaining.

Jep has invested last four decades into becoming the Rome's chief socialite and now he has the power to make party a success or disaster. But there's something compulsive about his pursuit of entertainment and admiration. Like a functioning alcoholic, Jep doesn't enjoy his life, but has no will to change it either. He reminds me of Michael Fassbender's sex-addict character in Shame. At the time of orgasm, Fassbender's expression was not that of pleasure, but of pain.

Soon after his 65th birthday, Jep notes to himself that he no longer can afford doing things he doesn't want to do. Instead, he looks up his old friends, learns more about his now-dead girlfriend who left him 40 years ago and develops a friendship with 41 year old stripper named Ramona. Ramona doesn't try to appear important or intellectual, she seems to exist entirely in the present moment. (That presence of mind has its own price, as we learn later)

One of the appealing things about Great Beauty is that its characters are not aware of how funny they are. The pinnacle of comical absurdity is a 104 year old Catholic 'saint'. She's not official saint yet, we're told, but everyone calls her Santa (Saint) Maria. She looks like a mummy that just walked out of its glass case in British Museum, communicates with animals and at one point parodies the 'stair crawl' from the Exorcist. And yet, at no point the film is making fun of her. Nobody seems to question their sanity when Santa Maria asks a flock of migrating flamingos to rest on Jep's balcony.

Sometimes I think the Great Beauty is making it intentionally difficult for us to get to the story. The opening scene with Jep's euro-trash birthday party lasts several minutes longer than storytelling rules require. The changes between scenes are often abrupt and even stunning, leaving the viewer to fill the gaps. There's no obvious drama or big emotional payoff, as you'd expect from an American movie. And yet, at its core, it's the same old story about a writer who has lost his inspiration and tries to figure his place in the world. I feel sympathy for him and his journey, just like I would in any other film.

Smart, chic, beautifully filmed, spectacular to view and utterly boring. This movie may be great for anyone wanting to see views of Rome but then again, if you do, why not get a travelogue? Why so many accolades have been heaped on this film is simply beyond my simple movie-goers ken. Hopefully the Americans (at the Oscars) will have more sense than the rest of the 'awards world'. Perhaps it's a bit like the Emperor's New Clothes, everyone knows there's something lacking but no one wants to say because everything's so grand. Yes, the cinematography is excellent and some of the sets stunning but most of us like a story in a film - even a documentary - and it helps if the story includes someone you can empathise with, even if you don't like them. What's the story here? Possibly, unlike the 'eternal city' life isn't eternal but then we know that don't we? Like Jep, at the age of 65 (not quite) I realise I no longer have time to do things I don't want to do. If I hadn't had to clear up the local hall after the film, I would have left before the end and probably run at and then slammed my head into a wall, just to wake up.

For me, this film goes to the absolute limits of what can be achieved in a film. Each shot, each scene is a thing of great beauty. The plot is secondary. It was a delight to watch. I might admit a bias: I am an Italophile. And this film has all things Italian: style, of course, but more than that it's the attitude that no matter how they look, they're confident in themselves. There were lots of ironic moments in the film as well: almost as if it were the Italians mocking themselves. Film centers around a main character, and Toni Sevillo is perfect. His character is memorable: he stands out like a character in a great novel. All the other actors, almost stock characters are perfect too. The film's got some ideas too: ideas about art, and life, and transcendence, but somehow one doesn't pay much attention to these too, given all this beauty.

To my opinion the movie shows a great work done by the director , actors and also a great soundtrack, but it lacks a purpose. After watching so many beautiful parts of life, parties, music, love, belief I was not getting the point of why certain elements had to be on the movie. It looks like many elements are inserted there only for the reason of appearing beautiful under a certain light and with a certain music on the background and that's it. I would like to mention here the Chekhov's gun principle that goes more or less like : "If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there." . To me this movie has a lot of pistols hanging on walls and very few of them are fired.

The analogy presented several times in this film is that Proust wanted to write a book about nothing. That is also what the director of this film has done, and what the main character has done with his own life. This is a film about nothing, but of course still about something  the main character Jep. The film is simply just about this character and how he spends his time. 

Jep has self-reflection, he's honest, doesn't take things so seriously, and he doesn't try to convince himself that he's something that he's not. Although one of his snobbish, bitter and self-righteous acquaintances annoys him, he doesn't let it bother him too much, and he doesn't say anything about it until she asks him to. He lives a happy, carefree life and is not consumed with worries. Unlike the most of us who "spends the summer making plans for September" as one of the characters say, Jep "looks for the great beauty" by living in the present an enjoying everything beautiful around him  paintings, food, birds, churches, trees, the ocean, etc. He finds joy in this moment and not in the future. It is actually quite inspiring to watch. But there is nevertheless something missing. Life basically has two missions: Accomplish your dream (whether through work or through raising a family) and find companionship (whether with a partner or with friends), and while Jep has certainly enjoyed his time in Rome, he hasn't achieved any of those two goals. Sex with someone new is not something beautiful shared with another person for him, but simply an everyday thing that's part of his lifestyle. I found this to be one of the key themes in the film. Jep tries to find "the great beauty" in life but hasn't found the greatest one of them all: love. He has gone through life partying, shagging, smoking and enjoying, but has never found the woman he loves, nor had any children.

All of these characters are trying to find a place where they belong, but none of them are really successful. Most of them want to be accepted by the right crowd or the right woman, but fails in a hierarchy where you can never reach the top. As the movie progresses, more and more people leave Rome as they haven't found the great beauty of love either. One doesn't even want to bring his furniture but just leaves everything behind. Apparently, he hasn't accomplished or accumulated anything there that he would want to remember. So, it's also a critique of modern day Rome and all its citizens' love of being hip. It's elegantly done, and especially the dialogue is beautiful, poetic and well-written.

Another reference to literature I found was that the main character and some of the other characters remind me of the three main characters in Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (the character in this film who wants to stage a play would be Basil Hallward).

The biggest drawback of this film is its length. A film about nothing that lasts almost two-and-a-half hours is simply too long. Had it been 30 or 45 minutes shorter it would have been a more pleasant view. The film starts out as a beautiful feel-good film, but ends up as a sad tragedy  with some hope though. It's never too late to make a change.

I saw part of this movie in the cinema, and slept through the rest. With the sound levels in the cinema, and all the visuals this says a lot. I've seen the rest a few months later. This looked too much as a commercial for plastic surgeons, drug dealers and local tourism. The overacting and the storyline: Well, it's like Sep said about the "trains in the Roman parties". The first hour, I thought: "It's introduction, so I'll understand where they're going", but at the end I still was waiting to see all snippets of information to come together. If I were to give a demerit point for every 5 minutes of being bored I would vote a large negative number. I'm probably too stupid to see the absurd beauty of the movie, or too honest to fake it.

The film begins in Rome at the splashy, bacchanal 65th birthday party of the dapper Jep Gambardella. Calling the event extravagant would be an understatement.

Gambardella is a celebrity socialite. He spends most of his afternoons laying around in a hammock, drinking, staring at the coliseum from his terrace. Killing time until the party-wild evenings. Jep lives a comfortable, carefree, decadent life.

Sometimes he thinks about a coastal summer romance from his youth - shown with Jep laying in bed and watching blue waves move across the ceiling, and also in brief flashbacks.

Forty years ago ago Jep wrote an acclaimed novel, inspired by that intense romance. He has not written a novel since, and now works as a high society journalist. In one scene Jep reviews a performance art show where the artist sprints and head-butts a stone wall.

he glitterati Jep surrounds himself with are the kind of people who wait in line with each other to get Botox injections, as nonchalant as if they're waiting to buy movie tickets. As one woman tells the man injecting her, "Just got back from India. I had amazing dysentery. Come to my divorce party, I'll have burlesque dancers there." When Jep and his friends get together they talk about subjects such as Marxism, collectivism, misanthropy, and defeatism.

Jep refuses to acknowledge any disagreeable aspect of life. At one of his regular dinner parties a friend tries to tell him about her son, who is experiencing mental health issues. Jep immediately dismisses the subject by recommending a psychiatrist, and then starts to talk about the salad.

In one scene Jep shops with his girlfriend for a funeral dress. They are in a patronizing store where the entire selection of dresses, displayed on the walls, can be counted off on your fingers. During this scene Jep explains the rules for how one must conduct themselves at a funeral, which he sees as a social event. The behaviours he describes equate to calculated self promotion.

After Jep's former lover (the one from his youth) passes away, he learns that he was the only person she ever loved. The person who tells Jep this is the woman's husband of thirty five years. He discovered this when going through his wife's journal. The news shocks Jep. Perhaps in spite of this, he considers writing again. He gets into a relationship with a woman. He cries at a funeral (something he previously said to never do.)

So with these changes in Jep's life the director is basically trying to show that Jep is becoming more disillusioned with his frivolous lifestyle? That at the end of the film he is a more rounded person? That instead of numbing himself at endless decadent parties, Jep is forced to confront deeper aspects of life: hurt, love, death? Well, Jep was a despicable person at the start of the film. And in the end he is the same; a narcissistic, flippant man. His friends are shallow, materialistic, and conceited.

At one of his parties Jep tells the person he sits beside that the dance trains at their parties are the best in Rome. The next shot is of Jep drunkenly leading one of the trains. And then Jep is sitting next to his housekeeper, disillusioned, lamenting about how his life is nothing. Well how noble and sincere, you sanctimonious piece of crap. 

The film is gorgeously shot, and the music is sublime. The opening scene contains choral music so transcendent it is unearthly. And then we're blasted into an aural storm of ecstatic club beats. And there is also the devastating pastorale composition, combining the music of Arvo Pärt with a choir rendition of Robert Burn's beautiful poem My Heart's in the Highlands, which mourns the narrator's lost youth in the Highlands. 

"The Great Beauty" is insipid, meandering, and unnecessarily long. The title is appropriate to the material, as "The Great Beauty" is totally self-righteous. At the heart of this movie (or where a heart should be) is a group of terrible human beings.

I see nearly every art film that comes to town. This is just my opinion, but I think The Great Beauty was one of the worst of 2013. It's almost all spectacle and almost no substance. There is no story to speak of and little character development; just two hours and twenty minutes of mostly unrelated scenes showing the decadence of Rome's affluent. The movie reveals less of the city itself than you might think based on the reviews. And many of the scenes are at night, limiting what you can see. 

Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), the main character, is one of the few people in the film who are halfway likable. Most of the other characters are types whom you would be happy never to meet in real life. Servillo has a very expressive face, and I'm sure he would be interesting to watch in a better movie. But here he is forced to wander aimlessly through scene after vacuous scene. Supposedly, Jep is taking stock of his life now that he's reached his 65th birthday. You keep expecting him to have some kind of epiphany, but there is little evidence of it on the screen.

I rarely feel moved to extol the virtues of a film but this is an astoundingly good one: by turns slyly funny and profound. All the ingredients are exceptional; cinematography, music and performances - especially the central role. 

It is not just the Roman setting that is reminiscent of Fellini at his very best but the feeling of watching a film that resembles a grand tapestry with many themes and threads woven through it. Most of all it quivers with that anarchic energy you find in only the best Italian films.

This is on general release in the UK at the moment. I would strongly advise trying to catch it in a proper cinema with a good sound system while you can. You won't regret it!

Have I seen the same movie as the other reviewers? I've REALLY tried to stay to the end of this movie to see if I things would get better but I just couldn't suffer any longer. The director clearly tried to copy some of Fellini's imaginative creations instead of his own. This was not even a homage to the great Italian director. Shame Oscar Academy to award this movie as the best foreign film of 2013. If you don't agree with me just watch "The Hunt" or "The Broken Circle Breakdown". How about "The Attack", "Blue Is the Warmest Color",the documentary "The Act of Killing", "No","A Touch of Sin", "Like Someone in Love", "Blancanieves", "The Attack" and the list go on and on

To say that La Grande Bellezza overflows with references to La Dolce Vita, the beacon which still sheds its nostalgic light upon Rome's nightlife and myth, is an understatement. In this regard, originality is certainly not a quality that one is likely to find in that film. Similarly to its model, La Grande Bellezza's main character is a middle-aged man who has renounced his literary ambitions so as to revel in Rome's superficial jet set; this allows him to hold a privileged position as both witness and accomplice to the "eternal city"'s contradictions. Likewise, Jep Gambardella is both detached and passionate, cynical and elegiac about his city and its inhabitants - much like, apparently, the film's director. The film basically consists of a series of apparently disconnected episodes in Jep's roaming around the Italian capital. These episodes are suffused with a breathtaking sense of beauty and awe (yes, you will fall in love with Rome when you see this!), yet these scenes are systematically mitigated contrapuntally by grotesque interludes, satirical of Rome's religious, artistic or social elite, much as in Fellini's film. In short, for me Sorrentino's film is the dream offspring, updated and highly stylized, of the giant it never ceases to pay homage to.

Have you ever been to a restaurant that is trying way too hard to be fancy and unique? if so, you have already experienced this film. I waited an hour for something redeeming to happen but it never did. I was stuck for 2.5 hours, watching vignettes of contrived dialogue and attempts at artistic cinematography that contributed nothing to the already very weak story line. I am baffled by the great reviews for this film. I presume the people who gave it high ratings are either unsophisticated film fans or people who have been sadly deprived of true cinematic art. The writer obviously collected dozens of various bizarre scene concepts over a period of many years and finally thought he had discovered a way to cleverly assemble them to tell a story. It's really too bad that he has such a limited vision since the premise for the story had tremendous potential. About 20% of the audience walked out well before the end and the remaining were completely tuned out and visibly agitated.

The Great Beauty, a movie I am afraid many people in the US will never get to see, is by far the best movie of the year.

If you do not like this film, I am sorry, but you are one of the three:

1. Some narrow minded couch potato movie watcher who thinks that movies should be about bangs and animated big flares, 2. Someone who has very little imagination, expecting 'realistic' stuff in cinema, to the extent of confusing a film with a reality show, 3. Someone who has never considered living away from his home town or have no understanding and appreciation for a European way of living.

Those who complain that this movie does not really have a story, that it is boring, that it is not realistic... Stop watching things and get a life. You can read the rest of this review later. 

Yes,there will be lots of people who do not have a taste for this kind of movie. There is no action, no animation, no heroes, no glorified fake true stories. There are characters you do recall from your daily life. And beautiful images and emotion. 

Here are some outlines to keep in mind, before seeing the next movie.

1. A film is an art piece- it is more than a plain 'every-day-stories' telling device. In any film, the script helps, but it is the visuals who tell the story. And in this movie visuals tell the story and give the emotions to the audience very successfully. 

2. A movie does not have to be a cover to cover, single story book. Sometimes it is a book of small stories. So is this one. Watch every cut as if it was a short film. You will find that every small story is wax poetic, every scene can be framed as a photo, every ending is left open for the audience to figure out the whys and whats.

3. Music can tell more in a movie when the characters are silent. In this movie the sounds are excellent. The music, dialogs, the smiles and the eyes, all reflect elements of looking back at one's life: remembering choices and disappointments.

4. If you like Fellini and his strange characters, do see this movie. What I loved about the movie is seeing the interesting, odd characters of Fellini back in today's cinema. They are missing in Hollywood and I don't know why. Camera moves similar to that of 8 and 1/2. 

The maze scene reminded me of one of my all-time favorite scenes in movie history: in 8 and 1/2, when Guido goes back to his childhood and remembers the bathing... Running around women with sheets hanging on ropes, shadows on the walls... The maze scene and the little kid gave me the exact same feeling.

This movie is the grand theater of life. If you are looking for seeing something to remember for years to come, this is the best in season.

Whilst not quite so beguiled as the other viewers who have commented here I did find much to admire yet this admiration was tempered by the constant compulsion to relate The Grand Beauty to previous movies, principally those of Fellini - the several 'grotesques' in the cast; the aimlessness of the central character; the episodic rather than straight-ahead storyline - so that I was constantly saying to myself, where are we now, Amarcord?, La Dolce Vita? Toni Servillo's Rome is at once real and surreal and he wanders through it as if, at one moment he is not Jason himself but a minor Argomaut content to pursue a silver fleece, and at the next a watered-down Orpheus following Eurydice above, instead of below ground. Extremely lyrical in spots, extremely blah in spots. Sue me.

Apart from some picturesque scenery and aesthetically pleasing segments, this movie has virtually nothing to offer. It is insufferably lengthy (two-and-a-half hours!), nothing of any significance happens, the main character, an anti-hero improbably named "Jep" (short for what? such a name does not exist in Italian) wanders around in a daze, looking like a not particularly intelligent zombie. The whole exercise is redolent of Fellini at his worst (superficial characters, boring scenes in glitzy environments dressed up as 'daring', pseudo-philosophical dialog without any worthwhile content). Andersen's story about a naked emperor comes to mind...It's puzzling to me how such a movie could impress so many critics, prize-awarding juries etc....

Greetings again from the darkness. This is Italy's submission to the Academy for Best Foreign Film of 2013. If it wasn't such a beautiful film to watch, a fun game of spot the Italian director influence could be played. Director Paolo Sorrentino owes much to Fellini and La dolce vita, but this is more than a tribute. Sorrentino shows much style and insight, and his commitment to camera angles, movement, colors, textures and faces are quite something to behold.

Toni Servillo plays Jep Gambardella, a man celebrating his 65th birthday by doing what he does most every night ... partying with his group of intellectual friends. Jep had a successful novel published in his 20's and has since worked sporadically as a journalist, but has never again focused on his writing. One can't help but notice the similarities to Marcello Mastroianni in La dolce vita, but Jep is jolted with news that sends him flashing back to his younger years and his one true love.

Much of the story includes Roman decadence, and it can easily be viewed as the decline of Roman civilization both past and present. See, Jep's apartment overlooks the famous ruins of The Colosseum. Even moreso, we get a nice conflict between uppity society and the all too important modern and conceptual art crowd. Toss in a few pot shots at the Vatican and Sorrentino seems to be telling us that everyone takes themselves entirely too seriously ... even as we belittle and judge others. Whatever his true message, the sensory overload provided here could be a film class in camera style and is quite fun to watch.

The 2014 Oscar winner in the category Best Foreign Language Film of the Year is a deceptive, pretentious, pointless, dull and boring movie that seems that never ends. 

The story is centered in an arrogant and futile Italian journalist that becomes famous with his only best-seller and then spends his life in the Roman high-society, going to parties and writing social columns. After his sixty-fifth birthday, he learns that his first sweet-heart died and she had loved him her entire life. This discovery apparently makes him bitter with his empty life and friends. 

The cinematography is top-notch and is the only thing that worths in this tedious movie that does not have continuity along the scenes. There are some bitter dialogs but the best part is indeed when the film ends after 142 minutes running time of boredom. My vote is two.

Title (Brazil): "A Grande Beleza" ("The Great Beauty")

The emperor has no clothes. My first sentence sums it up but like the movie this review has to be padded with meaninglessness just to fill up the space required for a review to be published. The film is like a Rorsarch inkblot test. There's not too much to it and consequently reviewers will project all sorts of meaning onto a film that has none. I guess you somehow have to justify why you would sit there in sheer boredom for nearly three hours. Fortunately my partner and I had the sense to walk out before the end with reality intact and not analyzing the hidden depths of the movie because basically there were none. See it as what it is and don't project anything on it.

Overblown, overdressed, overlong, overpaid, boar-ing and bore-ing in more ways than one. The analogies to Fellini are completely exaggerated. It is hardly a sequel to La Dolce Vita; it's no more engaging than a rich film student's attempt at parody.

There are few scenes that feel any more than false, the central character has absolutely no likability and his friends are some of the least interesting caricatures ever committed to film. I felt completely distant, unbearable boredom, complete disinterest, and annoyed while watching this as my attention was on the utter disaster of people who had just faced the horrifying destruction of the Philippines in the massive typhoon just days earlier.

Everything shown in the film was painful to watch, grating in its devotion to absolute decadence without purpose. This is a sad commentary on Italian film history, which gave the world such poetry when we saw real life displayed in all of its harsh angles during the era of Italian Neo-realism.

If only someone like Goddard could stand up for us poor deceived sheep, and really put a stop to the movement of film towards unbridled sensationalism.

How is it that this useless exercise in visual gluttony is being presented for awards like a polished golden turd? What happened to the brilliance of Pasolini, Antonioni, Rossellini, and dozens of others (not to mention Fellini of course) -- how is it possible that instead of their brilliant lessons, we have to deal with such pretension?
