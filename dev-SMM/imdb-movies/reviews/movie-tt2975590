### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
The clue was in the title all along and I just failed to see it.

It's like the studio and creative minds behind this disaster were so stoked with the idea of having Superman and Batman fight each other, they couldn't have a coherent thought after to come up with any form of a story. So they let Zack Snyder make a movie to satisfy the 10 year old in him. 

Major spoilers ahead!

I thought there were 3 very strong, compelling ideas from the trailers, but the movie failed to delivery on them

1. Batman's aggression towards Superman. 3/4th of this movie is dedicated to this. In fact Batman wants to KILL Superman. And finally, when the moment arrives, Batman stops because his mother's first name is the same as Superman's mother's. And so they become the best of friends. Just like that.

2. People of earth's distrust of Superman, due to the events from the first movie. This too runs through most of the movie, with Superman trying to earn some brownie points by saving a few people. The fact that there is a public hearing against him, indicates that people are not buying it. But in the end, after his supposed death, why does he a get a military/hero style funeral? Why is the country mourning? Did I miss something? Especially since there is confusion on what happened during the hearing.

3. The public hearing: This should have been a really powerful scene. If Superman were to concede, then he'd be answerable to the people and he would not get to be the hero we know he is. The same, if he did not concede. I was giddy with anticipation when this scene started and was immensely disappointed when the Senator starts mumbling. Zack Snyder took the path of least resistance.

- - - - - -

I guess after the writer's gave up on the main ideas, they didn't care about smaller plot points

- Superman has no remorse for the destruction he caused in the first movie. In the big fight he smashes Batman through a building causing the building to collapse. Ditto for Doomsday, smashes him in to a power plant of some sort. He is not even thinking about anyone's safety.

- Just like in the first movie, there is an apocalypse level destruction. Superman himself contributes to some of it. Thousands are probably killed, but superman only saves Lois Lane

- Superman threatens Batman that he can easily kill Batman, twice. Sounds like a bully to me

- Batman STEALING from Lex Luthor so HE gets to exact revenge on Superman

- Batman uses guns, not to intimidate, but actually kill. He even dreams of gun battles.

- The govt. has Zod's body and the ship for 2 years. Luthor comes up with the idea that since the ship has a bio-metric security, he can use Zod's body to gain access. It did not cross anyone else's mind

- One alien craft/tech is lying in the Indian Ocean for 2 years. No nation/military has claimed it. Local fishermen are freely swimming to it and breaking away pieces

- The all powerful Kryptonian key has no security what so ever. Anyone can use it. Even Lex Luthor. It only unlocks EVERYTHING, why should it be secure?

- Kryptonians have banned the technology to create Doomsday. It's so dangerous, they decide not to remove it from the system but keep it, with so minimum security that it can be enabled with a simple voice command by a non-Kryptonian.

- There is no compelling reason behind Lex Luthor's hatred towards Superman. How does he stand to gain or lose?

- There is no villain, purpose, motive or problem to solve in the story. Doomsday appears so that Zack Snyder can once again have a city-leveling battle.

- Why is Doomsday angry with Superman? Since he is made from Zod & Luthor's genes, does anger/hatred towards someone pass through genes?

- When Batman steals the Kryptonite, it would have spoiled whatever Luthor had planned, but Luthor just eggs Superman to fight Batman like they were in cahoots. How does Luthor know what Batman has planned? How does he know about the battle royale. Has he read the comic?

- Why is Batman not suspicious of the other meta beings? Why does he think they are friendly and will help? And against what? Why does he think he will need their help? How come Luthor is in on this?

- Why does Luthor have well designed logos for each meta human? 

- Why was wonder woman so concerned with being exposed? According to the photo, she had already revealed herself, in FULL COSTUME. So why the secrecy? And why come out of hiding when she sees lightening coming from the dome? She did not feel the need when world was practically getting destroyed in the first movie.

- Why does Luthor introduce Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent to each other? BW is a billionaire, but CK? Why would anyone care about him?

- Superman stops the car chase. Literally allowing the bad guys to escape. He may not like Batman's methods, but he couldn't figure out if Batman's giving a chase, he's after bad guys?!

- In the midst of deafening destruction Superman can hear Lois Lane. But his mother...his hearing, speed, x-ray vision...he doesn't even give it a shot. And of course Batman finds her in a jiffy because he is...

... the list goes on...but IMDb has a word limit...

I can't believe such a high profile movie had no thought put behind it. Amateur hour. A total disservice to a 75 year legacy and to the fans. I hope the remaining DC movies are scrapped or they finally pulls their socks up.

Sadly, a step down from Man of Steel. First of all, I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half hours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). The action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it), but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other than that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as (or more than) I did.

Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case. 

It's directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams' portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it's a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.

Speaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I've seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I've loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg's performance just doesn't work. There's little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he's from a completely different film. 

The other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed "the greatest gladiator match in the history of man", but the reality is that it's merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn't hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film "The Dark Knight Returns", but it's probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself "I'm kind of bored right now". How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?

There are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn't think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn't get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I'm incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck's solo Batman film. With that said, I don't think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer's score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman's theme with the new haunting Batman theme.

Ben Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn't be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.

I honestly can't believe I'm sitting here typing an average review for a film that's one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there's an unnecessary or strange scene out of place. Sure, I enjoyed the film more the second time I saw it, but I just can't believe how sloppy of a filmmaking job this was. A missed opportunity for Warner Bros for sure.

I am drawn back to when this movie was first announced and how I despised the notion of a Batman V Superman film a la Freddy vs Jason, Alien vs Predator and so on. It all seemed like a huge gimmick to me and I expected the worst for this movie. Fast forward a couple years, I am sitting down at a private screening, the lights go down and the movies opens up. The opening sequence was not what I expected but shows Snyder's visual creativity in a similar manner as he did with the opening sequence of Watchmen. 

We are hearkened to the Black Zero Event, only we see it from Bruce Wayne's perspective as shown in some of the trailers. I love that Snyder uses Bruce's as the eyes of the audience to get an outside perspective of the surrounding madness and destruction, and he does it very effectively. You are mad at these beings, you feel the terror, the confusion the anger for them bringing there war here, it plays out with spectacle and sadness. 

I had reported a rumor about Scoot Macnairy's characters months back and was called out by Ocelot and others several times on things I reported, well turns out it was true. Something tragic happens at the hearing and it is our insight of how cunning and vicious this Lex Luthor is. 

The overall story is well woven and much better than MOS, you can definitely breathe a sigh of relief in that Terrio does a great job of crafting this all together. The movie is a visual tour de force as we have come to expect with Snyder but let me just say that his directing has also improved. For those who moaned about the shaky cam and muted colors, they will be pleased. Performance wise. EVERYONE does an outstanding job, the standouts to me were Affleck, Eissenberg and Gadot. I was not on the Ben, Gal, Jesse hate wagon, though I found Eissenberg's casting questionable but I felt he had shown that he has some capable range of pulling it off. Affleck is Bruce Wayne, Affleck is Batman, talk about casting redemption. Similar to Reynolds, GL>Deadpool. Affleck should no longer be bogged with complaints about Daredevil. 

For those that hated on Gadot, suck it, she owns the role in every way possible, she really has stepped up her acting game as well. The woman has presence as Diana, grace and beauty and as Wonder Woman, she is truly a Goddess. People were moaning about Gail's size, forget that nonsense, she proves she does not need bulking muscles to be a warrior and her fight scenes are exceptional, makes Faora look like she was waltzing. Eissenberg, well well well. Let me first say I thought the best versions of Luthor were from the Lois and Clark and Smalville TV shows but Jesse brings something totally new to the game. 

Jesse plays his Luthor like a true devil. He is deceiving, manipulative, conniving, that line the Devil will do it, he is referring to himself to me. I could not help but see him like a Lucifer in his role and wondered if Jesse kind of based playing his character that way. Everyone else support wise was absolutely great. I do not want to write a long report of praises so let me see if I can cap off before getting on my flight. The fight set up was a little weak but boy the pay off was spectacular. Cavill I feel needs to step up a little more, granted he was wonderful but he was out shined. He needs to get beyond that distraught expression that he likes to use because he does it to death in this and I found that annoying. 

The other member intro's were great and will have you all pumped for the JLA, the Knightmare scene was horrific and impactful and made me smile like a little geek. The final fight was amazing. Never in a CBM have we seen anything like it, yes I said it NEVER and lastly, I will say the movie does end on a heart wrenching note but a wink in the end. I loved it gave it a 9 and looking forward to seeing it again next week. If you guys have any questions ask I am going to be on a plane for the next 6-7 hours so will try to respond. I may have exaggerated about it being 10X better than MOS but I will say 5X better.

Let's be honest! We were all, even marvel fan boys, waiting for this movie. The two most well known superheroes fighting... what could go wrong!? A lot. 

The positives:

1. Batman & Alfred; Batfleck was amazing! Ben Affleck represented a batman that is damaged, changed his moral code(which if they play their cards right could be a center piece of solo batman films) and made him more bad-ass because of it. 

2. The action: Amazing Action! It's thrilling, exciting and beautifully shot. That is what Zack does though and I expected nothing less. 

3. Wonder woman: Supringsly well done. Her as Diana prince was maybe a bit stiff sometimes but she can make the character her own along the way. I trust her that much. Her as wonder woman was amazing!! I got chills when she joined the fight!

4. Cinematography is general. It is a beautiful film to look at. Nicely shot and as I said the action is amazing. The CGI in certain places are a bit "meh" and one shot did take me out of the movie, but that's it. 

Now the bad stuff why this movie went downhill:

1. the editing/pacing: Guys, this movie was a mess. The movie begins great with an introduction of batman and some stuff you saw in the trailer. Then we go to a scene... which tells us a story then it goes to another scene. You're invested in that particular and then it jump cuts to another scene. You are seeing 4 different story lines play out in 5 minute scenes after each other. As a general movie goer-ER you will lose track. As a DC-fan, as myself, I could understand everything but i needed to bring all my previous knowledge to actually understand. Really bad pacing

2. Superman: Not everyone will agree on this, but I think they handled superman horribly. He needs to be symbol of hope and yet he is never exactly that. There was certain montage, where it should shown that he was, but i never felt that he was. This representation was too dark. This was also more of a batman movie with superman playing a small part in that, yet batman's world is too dark for superman. If you want to combine their worlds, let Batman play a role in superman's world. 

3. Lex Luther. I hated his representation of the power hungry and menacing villain. He played mark suckable and was a complete miscast. I don't care if he was the son of the "real" lex Luther. It didn't fit. 

4. Doomsday: A complete waste of a great story arc. Why did they bring him in while there was so much going on.. 

5. The justice league set up: It felt rushed. The way they shoehorned all the other characters in was lazy writing. 

6. the whole motivation of superman fighting batman. batman's motivation was clear and great. Superman's was horrible. They were one conversation away from understanding each other, but they had to fight of course.

7. Many many plot holes, but i cant go into those because i don't wanna spoil the whole movie. 

verdict: If you love flashy action.. go watch it in Max. If you like great story.. wait till it releases on blue-ray.

6 out of 10 for a mediocre movie that should been an epic man. I was so disappointed. I see so many DC fans raging this movie was epic, but we're dealing with the phantom menace effect.

This movie tries so hard... and falls flat on almost every level. It is further proof that DC may be a master of the animated movie and they may be brilliant in the way they approach many of the TV properties but when it comes to movies they still can't pull it together. This is a long movie that feels even longer. Ben Affleck does a GREAT job as Batman, that doesn't mean I LOVED this Batman (I did not) but he does a great job and any problems there are with the character fall on the writer, producers and director. The problem with this Batman is no that he is brutish and violent and angry.. it's that he's not smart. He's not strategic and intellectual , brilliant and a world class detective. He is consumed by anger, hatred, vengeance and brutality (and not in a good way). He is blind in his rage and directs it towards Superman.

The ending, which should be amazing and outstanding fell flat in both viewings I went to. One a sneak peek and one to which I had purchased tickets on opening night and went to see with friends. The ending should be exciting and fun and amazing.. and it just... wasn't. It completely fails on every single level.

You should leave the theater with your mouth wide open from awe unable to withstand the anticipation of the next chapter... most people who were leaving the theater were tired, worn down and felt like they had gone a few rounds with Superman. The movie is tedious and boring with characters that I just did not care about at all. Oh no Louis is in trouble... oh look Batman is Angry, oh look Superman is Angry, oh my Martha is Angry. The problem with a bunch of characters who are essentially the same in attitude is that you just don't care.

The preview of the justice league, which people know is coming was forced as is but would have made a magnificent after credit sequence. It would have at least of given people something to talk about on the way out rather then just shaking their heads in disappointment or yawning.

I liked Man of Steel, I didn't love it but I liked it. This was no where near as good. While I have been a long , long time DC fan and unlike many fan boys have little problem with taking some creative liberties with characters (there are things that work well in years of comics that don't translate on screen), there are things that should evolve but not completely change. Doomsday was sadly, a disaster. In the comic he is a Goliath , matching Superman's physical might and that's pretty much it. His punches are so powerful they shatter buildings (which Snyder seems to really, really, really like to do).. there was no need to alter him to the point they did.

This movie would have been better served had Lex made a clone from Zod's body of Bizarro (makes more sense) and had it been only Batman and Superman, getting to know one another, learning about each other, discovering their differences and ultimately their similarities as they came together in the end to defeat a Superman level menace. After the credits , an email to Wonder Woman with Batman letting her know that he has discovered who she is. 

You could even have had wonder woman in it, she was a delightful character (in this film) and I enjoyed her scenes (she gets little screen time but I felt was one of the best characters). As it is it just falls flat.

I enjoyed one of the sequences with who I believe was the Flash (doesn't say) but I do wish it was Grant (CW) as he is the true flash. This movies wrongs can still be righted in the next one and I will likely see it when it arrives but I am not looking forward to it and have no real anticipation of it's arrival. If I got word it was canceled I would shrug my shoulders and hope they got it right next time around.

Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was pure awesome and dark. You can see he's traumatized by the events in the past, and he has some fantastic lines in general (Yes we see the whole parents thing again). Nobody should really be surprised that he was good with the role considering he's a solid actor, but I thought he was great. Versus Bale? That's a interesting question, because Affleck definitely regards Batman as a permanent part of his persona, while in Nolan series he eventually doesn't want Batman. In combat he's pretty much everything everyone would hope for from a film with Batman. One comment on the latest BvS trailer said he fought like the Arkham video games from a scene they showed. That's a good comparison. He's incredible in fights. Also the way Snyder records him in action, you can actually see him fighting unlike the Nolan films, which I'd imagine would make many people happy. He also gets a chance to use his detective skills, do not worry. Also his relationship with Irons, who plays Alfred, is just wonderful in general. Irons was exceptional in the role (Its Jeremy Irons for Christ's sake, of course he nailed the role) gets some witty lines and also gets pretty emotional later on. He didn't get a lot of screen time, just enough to be effective. Always passing advice to Batman.

This was a very frustrating movie. I had been looking forward to it, although was initially skeptical after hearing of Ben Affleck as Batman. Seeing the critics views at RottenTomatoes was very discouraging, but for some reason, IMDb showed favorable reviews by audiences. This gave me some hope.

That hope was in vain. This movie was all over the place. I'm quite familiar with the DC Universe, having been an on/off comics collector since the 70's. Even so, I found myself unable to keep up with the visions, dream sequences, time-travel visits(?), and just overall plot convolutions in this movie. Some IMDb reviewers have already done an excellent job highlighting the film's foibles, and I doubt I could do better. However, I gotta say something.

The casting of Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor was horrible, to the extent that Affleck as Batman warmed my heart in comparison (and I didn't much care for that). Luthor as crazy, essentially a retread of what we've seen as Heath Ledger as Joker, would have alone ruined the movie if that were the only bad thing about it. LL is a brilliant, evil, power hungry genius, not... whatever he was supposed to be here.

I cannot get into Batman's motivation. He's a ruthless violent vigilante who's above the law, and he despises Superman for being... above the law. I get the initial distrust thing, but I didn't buy into the whole picture of just wanting to be judge, jury, and executioner without even interacting with Supes first. Not cool, Bats.

Lex lets himself into the Kryptonian vessel, with the shaved fingertips of Zod? Kryptonian tech has *terrible* security; maybe they should give Apple a call - no, wait; the FBI hacked that. And then the computer recognizes the carcass of Zod, and doesn't go, "Hey, who are you? I thought *you* were Zod!" - and then kill him.

I know I was supposed to laugh or cheer when Batman tells Ma Kent, "I'm a friend of your son's," but for me it was flat. 10 minutes ago, he wanted to kill him.

On the way home, my wife and I were discussing the movie, with these observations and more. She asked me, "Was there anything about the movie you liked?" I thought real hard, and said, "um... no. Sorry to have suggested it and make you watch it." And thus justifies my 1-Star review. I guess I kind of liked how Superman comported himself with dignity, and was reasonably well-acted by Cavill. But not enough to change my score.

Hey, wasn't there also something about Wonder Woman in the movie? That quickly faded from memory.

SPOILER ALERT !!! (Funny how there can still be such a thing when the movie is already spoiled to begin with)

This movie was marketed to patrons of all ages but only appeals to ages 12 or younger. 

My top 8 reasons (in no discernible order) to avoid seeing this movie and save 2 1/2 hours of your life...Don't do it!

1. Amy Adams/ Lois Lane - Wow! what a terribly written part for this character...Clueless and painfully unaffected by everything going on around her... I speak for all true Superman fans when I say, Margot Kidder, eat your heart out baby!

2. The opening sequence - Bat boy Bruce Wayne sees his parents killed at gunpoint....AGAIN! Why must we always have to be spoon-fed the origin of this character in every damn movie. The psychotic flashbacks from his past will likely be thrown in later on in the movie and can allude to the dark knights brooding demeanor just fine, thank you.

3, Zack (rhymes with HACK!) Snyder/ The Director - The slow motion scenes used in this movie are such a desperate contrivance. His signature trademark only lends to extending the run time of the movie (ad-nauseum) and slows the pacing down (or lack thereof) to a complete stand still at times. There's slo mo used during the funeral scene...'NUFF SAID!

4. Confusion - Early scenes will attempt to confuse the viewer (successfully) in order to tie together several gaping plot holes (unsuccessfully). The problem here is you can see these outcomes coming a mile away. The viewer is left feeling patronized and a lack of a decent script becomes evident, as a result.

5. Jeremy Irons/ Alfred the butler - Holy cow man! This guy has been mailing it in for the better part of 2 decades (since Die Hard with a Vengeance). It seems the studio financiers felt the need to strengthen the budget here by slashing the Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine salaries allowing the 2 characters to morph into one, contemptible performance by a British actor with some real acting "chops"

6. Jesse Eisenberg/ Lex Luthor - Wins the award for all time best over-acting a comic book villain since Willem Dafoe played the Green Goblin. After this heinous acting performance by Eisenberg, I am beginning to think Heath Ledger raised the bar too high for this new generation of Hollywood soft, pretentious pretty boy actors. 

7. THE MAIN PLOT OBLITERATED BY.... Their MOTHERS HAVE THE SAME FIRST NAME- 2 hours of very thin plot will be totally obliterated by Batman in a scene so horribly painful. The very premise from the start is Batman going after Superman. When the audience finally arrives at this crucial moment, The Batman is going to end The Superman and get what he so painfully wanted the whole time...AND what happens next? unfortunately it goes down like this, I kid you not! Superman says Martha!, his mothers name and Batman says WHAT! WHY did you say that name, Martha!, that's my moms name!, and then Superman says MARTHA! HEY! that's my moms name! and then they cry and hug each other and become best of friends the rest of the movie!

8. LAST BUT NOT LEAST - BEN AFFLECK/ BATMAN WOW WOW WOW ...Val Kilmer and George Clooney are breathing a collective sigh of relief after seeing this pile of steroid garbage take on the role of Batman. Yes after 2 long decades the monkey has been removed off of their backs...The worst possible Batman performance in history award can now be owned solely by Mr. Ben Affleck...Did anyone ever doubt him???

Boy oh Boy....this was a great experience....I have to say after Man of Steel (which was okay but by no means great), I didn't have much expectations from this, and to top it off the castings for this film had set the comic book fans on fire. But tell you what, this is epic. Some people are even calling it better than the Dark Knight, while I wouldn't go that far, I would still call this a complete package. Affleck's Batman is AMAZING. His Bruce Wayne is not as cool and casual as Christian Bale's but he doesn't need to considering this is a relatively old Batman who has seen some very dark times. His partnership with Jeremy Irons adds some much needed lightness to the movie. Cavill delivered the dialogues during the fight scene with Batman in a near perfect way. Gal Gadot had a much bigger role to play than seen in the trailers. And Jesse was good in a complex way. Fans have to understand that his Luthor is not muscular as compared to what we have seen in previous Superman movies His Luthor is an evil genius who does a great job of pitting the two giants against each other. Jesse played the role to his strengths as he should have. Contrary to the popular perception(especially after the third trailer) that the whole movie was spoil-ed, the plot was way more deeper than we imagined. The only issues were a fight scene where CGI looked dull and maybe, just maybe a bit over stuffing. But overall, this is EPIC.

The storyline was slow, and the whole movie was built for the 10 years old children to understand whats happening. It was filled with clichés and was not creative at all. I was so disappointed after watching this. I watched this with my friends and they are on the same opinion. The worst Batman / Superman movie ever I think. Ben Affleck was not a good choice for Batman because he is not "blue blooded" enough and was not able to act like them.

Spoiler alert! Why did they need Wonderwoman? She was really unnecessary. (Only for the Hype maybe?!) :/ :/ :/ :/ PS.: Why they did not ask for David Mazouz to play in the first part?

After reading all the negatives reviews, I still went to watch (in 3D!) this superhero battle thinking it may not be the critics' film but at least it would be some spectacular mess offering some guilty superhero fun. (Short answer: No. Not fun. Not even spectacular. Just long boring mess!)

First things first! There is not much of a "battle" (physical or psychological) b/w Batman & Superman! They just fight once, and it goes exactly as anyone would have expected! Batman trying somethings - boom boom - which doesn't work and then hint: Kryptonite!

It's not even like cinematography or awesome background music is taking the film forward (like say Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch) to keep you rooted! It just keeps on going taking. Taking itself seriously. And then keeps on going even longer!

Essentially what happens is a guy does some hocus-pocus and creates a monster and these three super-things kill it. And just so that you know this is actually the whole movie for you. There's actually no role of wonder-woman in this film other than that shown in the trailers. Nothing! She shows up a few times and bam! directly at the final fight which was quite lethargically choreographed to say the least. Batman is loosely played by Ben Affleck wearing his famous scowl, but I wouldn't blame him as there is actually not much for him to do. Script has snatched away from everyone of any possibility of giving any good performances. Lois Lane is always the damsel in distress saved by Superman! Superman plays superman doing nothing at all. And there's much time given to their romance which nobody cares about. And if you have noticed even I have been writing this long about nothing but ranting my frustration because there's, as you guessed right, nothing concrete to criticize about in this two and a half hour long alarming amount of pretension on the name of a battle! And at last Superman is dead and all you are left thinking is "I don't give a f*** about it!"

I wanted to love this movie, it had potential to be a great superhero film but it was pretty God awful. The plot was confusing, the cgi was bad, Doomsday appeared WAY TOO EARLY and Superman DIES in his second appearance. And the casting was bad. I mean Jesse Einsberg as Lex Luther? The good things about this was the acting, it was pretty well. Wonder Woman was also AWESOME but overall this is a very poor movie. Save your money for Captain America Civil War instead because it will unfortunately be a lot better than this.

Don't bother seeing this unless your a fan of DC because there is a lot of eye candy and Easter eggs.

This is, hands down, the worst piece of entertainment i have seen in my life! Forget about coherence, forget about story, forget about humor, you find non in this junkyard. Batman vs Superman is about two wannabe bodybuilders who try to build up a heated and involuntarily gay atmosphere in 2.5 hours only to fight for 4 min with CGI rubble flying around. It is Brokeback Mountain meets Crossfitt commercial. Poor Ben Afleck never looked dumber! I am trying hard to find anything positive with this movie but it is really really hard. download this masterpiece,see 5 min and turn it off. Go do something nice with your buck! P.s. Avengers was crappy in its own right but this one takes the word to a new height!

P.P.s If your looking at the user review section to see a better feel for what people think of the movie, just beware of the fact that warner brothers hires people to make thousands of fake accounts to score this movie 10/10 to raise the overall score.

I was skeptical about this one from the get-go. Zack Snyder, basically a more talented and flashier Michael Bay, taking over the DC Extended Universe and pinning two of the greatest superheros against each other. I wasn't sure he could make it work. And I'm still not quite sure if he did. The reason I say that is because the movie is missing scenes. Like most of Snyder's work, it was meant to be a rated R, three hour long movie, and in order for a wide release it had to be trimmed which means some crucial scenes were modified or cut completely, and you can tell. The editing is choppy, even frustrating at times, and the pacing is nonexistent. There aren't any build ups. It just goes from exposition to AMAZINGNESS to exposition to BADASSERY to exposition to AWESOME HOLY SH*T EXPLOSIONS, etc. I won't blame Snyder until I see his version so as of now I'd pin that on the writers and editors (if there were any editors because holy hell some of the cuts are atrocious). When the big moments come, like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne's first meeting, or Lex Luthor's birthing of Doomsday, or hell when Batman and Superman finally go at it, they just happen. There's no emotional weight attached to any of it. It's freaking awesome to look at, but there's no pathos to give it the extra oomph that pushes great movies into the extraordinary.

Having said that, Batman v Superman is highly entertaining. The action set pieces are gorgeous and the titular showdown is indeed awesome when it finally comes. The heroes themselves are amazing. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is one of the most perfect choices in casting since Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. He IS Bruce Wayne. You never question it when he's on screen. Henry Cavill is great as the man of steel. He doesn't have much to work with but he shines when he needs to. And Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman steals the screen whenever she comes on. She's perfect. And when these heroes come together to fight the common enemy, Doomsday, it's truly a sight to behold. That is the main thing Dawn of Justice has over Man of Steel, the heroes. But while Man of Steel succeeded in the villain department with the commanding presence of General Zod, that is where Batman v Superman suffers most.

Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor didn't bother me as much as I thought it would honestly. For what he had to do, he was fine in the role. The problem is that the character is written as an obnoxious rich sociopath with a penchant for mayhem, so he's basically in the shadows for a majority of the movie acting as a puppeteer to pit Superman against Batman. He poses no physical threat of any sort. Hell, seeing him stand next to Batman and Superman you can easily see either of them crushing him like the cockroach that he is. But there is something unsettling about his unassuming manner. The courtroom scene in particular is a chilling one, and his rooftop monologue actually hits all the right beats and he borders on threatening. Again, it's less against Eisenberg and more on how the script wanted the character to be. Doomsday is fine also. The only reason he exists is to have an epic fight in the third act and it delivers, but as a character he's just... an anti-character. That's exactly what he is actually. The antithesis of Superman - a godless killing machine, a creature with no conscience, an unkillable force of nature. So he served his purpose, but there was no charismatic villain for me to be rooting for (or against). It's just a waiting game for the heroes to get into action.

The movie is also too long. Mind you, a sh*tload of stuff is crammed into the two and a half hours to warrant the runtime, but a few subplots could've been scrapped and the movie would've been better for it. I feel like if a good editor swept through the movie, trimmed the fat, put all the pieces in the right place and kept it at a tight two hours, Batman v Superman could be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. As of now, it's a beautifully fun mess. Entertaining as all hell but lacking in depth. And again, Zack Snyder's ultimate cut may be the perfect superhero movie, but we'll just have to wait and see. 

Which brings me to my main point, and that's Batman v Superman is a comic book movie. It's meant to entertain. Dissecting it and critiquing it as a piece of cinema is too easy and is an exercise in futility really, which is why I dismiss most of the critic reviews claiming it's a cinematic disaster when its entire premise is based around fantasy and the absurd. It's incredibly fun, and that's all it's supposed to be. The fact that it has some truly awe-inspiring moments and intermittently amazing dialogue is just icing on the cake. Batman v Superman is a flawed movie, no doubt about it, but it accomplishes what it sets out to. It gives us Batman versus Superman. It gives us the dawn of the Justice League. It gives us a big screen adaptation of Lex Luthor and a juggernaut of a villain in Doomsday. All the pieces are there. The question is whether or not you're willing to shut off your brain and sit back and enjoy the comic book epicness happening on screen. If you are, then Batman v Superman is an absolute must-watch thrill ride. If not, then why on earth are you seeing a Zack Snyder film in the first place?

This movie is such a let down, I watched a hour of this horrific peace of writing and cannot believe that they made such a stupid movie. The scenes were jumping from junk to more junk that made no sense. I absolutely love batman and superman and this movie is just insanely off what it should of been like... Good actors playing super popular parts but no story line what so ever. I was super confused throughout this whole movie. How is lex luthor not bald, and why is he being played by this quarky guy who should be like the riddler or something. I feel like I waisted a hour of my time watching this garbage and I would never put this in my top batman movie ever.

A Batman who behaves likes a hissy teenage girl taking the fight to Superman because there's 'a 1% chance he will destroy earth' when he was shown up to be of not much use when a nuclear warhead was fired or when Doomsday was totaling the city; a Batman who was all set to write his legacy by killing Superman (who doesn't know for a fact if Aquaman and the lot are friend or foe) only to become his friend just like that even saying cringe worthy lines like 'Martha will not die tonight' and the even worse 'I will not fail him in death'...

A Superman who could hear Alfred talking to Bruce Wayne at the party from miles away but couldn't tell that a bomb was ticking away less than 5metres away; a Superman who overdoes the love sick puppy bit stopping just short of tears (to an aging Amy Adams gawd); a Superman who gives Batman a face to face warning because that always works with foes (perceived or not)...

A movie that has borrowed from James Bond (from Bruce Wayne's aging brooding looks that were probably set for 'smouldering' to the red herring L'Americain-White Portugese to 'key' action sequence linking back to a location from the earlier movie - former MI6 Building v Man of Steel destruction site - to the Aston Martin etc) and Avengers (nuclear warhead, enhanced Iron Man suit, dream sequences - gawd how many were there!?!) with a Jim Carrey/Riddler-like Lex Luther but in an infinitely more annoying Jesse Eisenberg...

Actually, 2 out of 10 may be too much for making us suffer two and half hours of a self-important drama but seeing how Warner Bros seems to have bought sooo many 10/10 reviews here, it's about right.

Only Gal Gadot looked like she was having fun albeit her brief appearance and therefore, she should be declared the rightful winner of Batman v Superman.

It seems as though viewers of Batman v. Superman are split solidly into two camps: completely loving it or totally hating it. As simplistic as this may sound, this is because the movie has MANY elements that are either absolutely amazing or cringe-worthily awful, with very few scenes of true Hollywood neutrality/mediocrity.

Normally I would shy away from doing this, but because of the nature of the film, I believe a hate/love list would do the most justice (ba- dumb tiss).

LOVED:

- The movie tackled some quite sophisticated themes for the modern- day Hollywood, let alone for being a superhero movie. There was a deeper, intellectual debate that made me surprisingly introspective. MORE IMPORTANTLY, the main characters also choose opposing sides on these matters, and Snyder kept the themes prevalent throughout the film.

- Dark nature of the film makes the impossible idea of a superhero- laden universe just a tad more believable. At least, it's a step- away from the relentlessly light-hearted Avengers movies where the most emotional trauma suffered is from that of the death of a very minor side-character.

- The new, "bulky, shock-troop, vengeful" Batman is VERY convincing. I, too, was skeptical of Ben Affleck being cast as the new Dark Knight; however his performance/portrayal will leave you pleasantly surprised (subjective, but I was rooting for him!).

- Hans Zimmer does it again! The soundtrack was characteristically amazing. It's sad to hear that he is mulling retirement.

- For those with a more primal focus (I kid!), the action sequences were very entertaining, despite the fact that some of the CGI was lackluster. My favorite scene was hands-down the (K)nightmare.

HATED: 

- I'm trying VERY hard not to give anything away, but the big character-switch of the movie was completely unconvincing. Not only did this character have a long-standing, fervent opinion on certain matters, but they uproot their beliefs on how things should be done and completely switch sides in literally a matter of seconds. A sloppy, lazy character "development" that they tried to justify with a very weak excuse aimed at the character's past.

- Keep your pitchforks in the garage, because Wonder Woman was great, BUT! she stole absolutely imperative screen-time from Superman. The Man of Steel rarely found combative success in the movie and could have used more time in the spotlight (it is Batman vs. Superman after- all). 

- Main "villain", a.k.a., the CGI Punching Bag, was such a boring cop-out. My problem with monsters as villains is that they are completely un-empathetic and their actions aren't twistedly justifiable. You'd think that after the Joker's success in the Dark Knight, they'd have figured it out.

- Batman vs. Superman was horribly predictable. If you've seen it, you'll know what part(s) I'm talking about. This may be typical in the superhero-film industry, but come on, get a little risky every once in a while.

Side-Notes: 

A) Any (superhero) movie is far better when experienced in theaters, I suggest you check this one out while it's still playing.

B) 2 1/2 hours may seem like a long time, but as long as you have comfortable chairs, a lot of popcorn, and an appreciation for thorough plot-detailing and hidden Easter-eggs, you'll be just fine.

Love it, hate it, or come away having both feelings at the same time, should you choose to see Batman vs. Superman, you'll experience one of the three. It's hard to walk away from this film with the mere feeling of, "Eh, that was okay. Might see it again, who knows?"

Just as with every previous film, Snyder's grandiose visuals supersede and essentially suffocate any opportunities for intriguing plot, character development, or anything beyond CGI extravagance. The film presented too much and not enough simultaneously. The visual effects, dream sequences, and other traditional tropes of an action drama stood in the way of getting to know or care much about what is going on in this "universe."

PROS - Ben Affleck was a decent Bruce Wayne / Batman. - Henry Cavill remains a solid choice for Superman. - Aqua Man was barely shown. - Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburn, and Jeremy Irons were all solid in their minor roles. - If you're into special effects, you'll probably enjoy the absurd amount showcased in this film. 

CONS - Jesse Eisenberg - Snyder apparently forgot that Batman does NOT kill people - The "battle" between Batman and Superman lasted approximately five minutes of the 151 minute run time. - Batman's origin story is repeated and used to accent a major point within the film. - Far too much focus on Lois Lane (three heroes and she still shows up and plays a role in nearly every major battle sequence) - Lack of story and character development - Various plot holes - Ad naseum...

This is likely the last superhero film I will waste my time viewing, as the superhero "team" concept is already abysmal. Showcasing numerous heroes / super humans in one film takes away from the development, and therefore, the connection to the hero. "Oh well" says Hollywood; we're still making a killing!

I'll be the first to say that I hate hype. Hype to me is pointless and manipulative. The reason I hate is because where anticipation arises for the film after they see the trailer, they always found it disappointing once they saw it. This is the reason why I avoid trailers. Because I want to be open minded about films. Sometimes great movies can live up to the hype (See Star Wars 7 and Mad Max: Fury Road). But while people say that the concept is going to be awesome, I'm more worried about the execution of the final product than the idea itself. But sometimes when I see the film that people loved, I usually get baffled by it. 

Batman vs Superman is one of those films. 

Trying to explain the plot would be a nightmare, so because I was uninvested in the film, I'll instead provide a link to the Wikipedia synopsis (please be warned, there may be spoilers. So, tread lightly): 

You done? OK. Now to explain my reasons why I hated the film.

#1: No character development. Now, you simple-minded morons might be saying "Who cares about the story and characters? We want to see Batman and Superman fight!". I'm going to say "I freaking care about story and characters". If there is no character development, then it's not a good film. All of the characters in the film are very underdeveloped and very boring. Why? Because the audience wants to be invested in the film and if you have lame, underdeveloped characters, it just turns down the patience meter to 1. This is why I love the films of Frank Darabont, David Fincher, Jonathan Demme, Sam Mendes, Quentin Tarantino, etc. they put more effort into the story and characters and make sure the audience is invested in them. Speaking of story...

#2: Its unfocused narrative. OK, is this Batman vs Superman or Justice League: The Beginning? It only takes about 2 hours to see Batman and Superman fight. I wouldn't mind that except if the plot was more focused. There are so many subplots in the film that it becomes hard to care about this film. First, it's about Batman wanting revenge on Superman. But then, we get stuff like The Justice League, Wonder Woman, Martha Kent, Mark Zuckerberg, The Daily Planet, Lois Lane, General Zod's dead body. There's way too much to focus on. Good movies like Seven, Philadelphia and Shawshank have only 1 or 2 subplots (and the characters were more interesting). BvS has enough to fill a miniseries. Nothing is focused and the main objective (Batman fighting Superman) is only 15 minutes out of this bloated 151 minute film.

#3: It's.....too................sloooooowwwww. I'm serious, this is the perfect film for anyone who has no patience whatsoever. Long movies can be good (Saving Private Ryan was 169 minutes and it was great), as long as everything else is flawless. Would it kill Zack Snyder to cut out 2 subplots, as well as rewrite the scri...Ah, forget it. No-one cares characters anymore. They only care about making money and pissing off the audience. I just was bored by this supposed "action" film. Don't get me wrong, I like action films. The Terminator films were great (except for 3, Salvation and Genesis, all piles of crap). But Snyder however succeeds in making an action film that is boring as hell. I was so bored that I thought about leaving, but I stayed (because I don't like leaving while the movie is playing). You could sleep through an hour and you won't miss a thing.

Bottom line, I hate this film. I freaking hate this film. Not to sound hypocritical, but before the film came out, I predicted that exact same opinion and I was right. This is an example on why hype should never be trusted. It's a stupid, monotonous, boring, poorly developed, ADD- ridden, biggest pile of rubbish I have ever seen. Nothing's interesting. No-one manages to even save this film, not even Ben Affleck (How could you, Ben? You were in Gone Girl, for Christ's sake!). I'm surprised on why people love this film solely because of Batman and Superman duking it out. Well, to that I say, You're completely wrong. Just because Batman and Superman duke it out, doesn't mean that it's a great film. We have to know the characters before they duke it out.

Please, avoid this film. Plain and simple.

I thought I had seen it all when it came to bad comic book movies -  from the clumsiness of the Sam Raimi "Spiderman" films to the raging  dumpster fire that is "Batman & Robin". Then I saw "Batman v Superman:  Dawn of Justice" and got a rude awakening: I had no idea just how bad a  movie in the caped avenger genre could be. I didn't know a movie of any  kind could be this bad.  
Everything about "Batman v. Superman" is awful. The story is so busy  and overstuffed with characters that, in the end, it's hard to remember  what it's about. The fight scenes are bloody and loud without being  exciting, mistaking violence and noise for thrills. Worst of all, it's  no fun; there's not one single moment of excitement or adventure in two  and a half very long hours. I walked out of the theater dazed and  upset, as if I had just been mugged. This movie actually ruined my  night. 
The plot is almost impossible to follow, let alone recap, but I'll try.  Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) become enemies for  reasons that are never clear. They reluctantly join forces after Lex  Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) unleashes a Kryptonite monster and threatens  to kill Lois Lane (Amy Adams) if the two heroes don't fight each other,  which will help him take over Gotham City... or something. And then  Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) shows up out of nowhere for a loud, bloody and  utterly pointless climactic battle. 
Yes, this movie is confusing. Very confusing. But that's not even its  biggest problem. The worst thing about this movie is that it's no fun  at all. The pace is leaden, the "realism" is just boring - there's a  scene with a Senate hearing on C-Span, for God's sake - and the  characters look perfectly miserable to be there. Who could blame them? 
I have never seen comic book characters enjoy themselves less. Affleck  and Cavill treat being a superhero as if it's a burden, not an  adventure; they frown, grimace and speak with long, tortured pauses, as  if they are playing the lead in a high school theater production of  "Hamlet". Adams and Gadot aren't given a whole lot to do, but while  they're doing it they manage to look as if they're waiting in line at  the DMV. Even Eisenberg's giggly, hyperactive Lex Luthor smacks of  desperation; he mugs for the camera like an ignored middle child acting  out to get attention. 
A comic book movie without fun is the definition of failure. Comic  books are not Greek tragedy. They are stories designed for children,  and children at heart. It's in vogue these days to make "dark and  gritty" superhero movies, and it can be done well, as in Christopher  Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy. But those movies worked because they  balanced darkness with excitement, grit with joy. They had the kind of  magic that lets the 10-year-olds who live within even the most hardened  adults out to play.  
There is no joy in "Batman vs Superman". It doesn't know what magic is.  It's the only superhero movie I've ever seen that made me sad.

I'm sick of reading apologetic reviews for this film of the "If you can just get through the bad stuff, the rest of it is AMAZING" ilk.

We shouldn't have to endure dialogue this bad, acting this awful and plotting this lazy to get to the good stuff. Let's take a few examples:

- Cavill has zero chemistry with Adams. None. The scene where he leaps into the bath with her is so awkward it's embarrassing.

- And why is Amy Adams in the bath anyway? It's hardly a playful scene - she's talking about death and responsibility. I can only think it's played that way for "Phwoar! Amy Adams in the bath!" reasons.

- People in this film don't "do" motivation. Superman turns on Batman for being a vigilante above the law. Which he is too. The public turns on Superman because of crimes they KNOW were committed by other people. Lex turns on Superman because... well, I'm still not sure about that.

- Batman, the World's Greatest Detective - acts like an idiot for most of the film. Despite all evidence pointing at Lex, he allows himself to be manipulated into fighting Superman. Why didn't he use his detection skills on "Who sent those notes?" and "Who blew up the Senator?" and "Hey, why does Lex want all that Kryptonite anyway?"

- Batman is also kind of a sadist. No, I'm not complaining about the Bat-brand, I can live with that. But he takes his time toying with Superman. I'm not sure why. Again, motivation issues.

- I don't actually have a massive problem with Superman & Batman killing people. Although you have to admit, it makes you wonder how Lex & The Joker are still alive. But this movie doesn't care about plot holes. I believe there's actually a plot "black hole" at the centre of this film, sucking in all logic.

- Mmm! I'm not sure I can entirely blame - mmm! - Jesse Eisenberg for Lex. I mean how can you deliver lines as embarrassingly bad as these without sounding like a complete idiot? Yet no character in the film ever comments on the fact that he acts like the guy on the bus you see muttering to himself. It can't be his wealth. I know Lex is a billionaire, but then again so is Donald Drumpf and people call him crazy all the time.

- Plus "crazy" isn't the same as "scary". There's no menace, no sense of malevolent power in Lex. He's just an irritant. Someone to move the plot forward for no good reason other than to fulfil the promise in the title. Again, not Eisenberg's fault but why did they write him this way, instead of the power-obsessed, morally bankrupt businessman we've seen in Lex before? We didn't need Less-Interesting-Joker-Lex. 

- The arrogance of the film reminds me a little of "Prometheus" - another film that attempted to address big issues, but had no idea what to do with them. There's no philosophy here, no intelligence - having characters rant and rave about gods and mortals doesn't give them a coherent philosophy or moral outlook. In "The Dark Knight" The Joker had an actual philosophy - a corrupted viewpoint that ran counter to Batman's. Here, I can't tell what anyone stands for. What does Lex even want? 

How much of this mess can be blamed on Snyder is debatable - I think the bulk of the blame should be placed on Goyer & Terrio who should never be allowed to write anything ever again, including greetings on birthday cards. However, I will say that if Snyder were a half- competent director surely he should have binned this script and brought in someone else.

As for the film, I know it's made a lot of money which is actually a terrible shame. It means all of those responsible will feel it's acceptable to produce something this bad, so long as it has a big budget and impressive CGI (see also: Transformers). 

For me, it just isn't good enough, with this budget and these actors we deserved something better. With these iconic characters to finally show together on the big screen, we deserved something astonishing. The film-makers should be embarrassed.

I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the "Extended Edition " on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.

They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.

First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?

I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a "fan boy" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.

I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.

So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.

Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. 

The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!

I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.

Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes.

Well, I think it's safe to say that this movie was somewhat of a disappointment especially for the comic-book fans. Not saying that it's garbage or anything but this film is basically the definition of mediocrity and the term: "all flash but no substance".

Let me start up on the things that I liked about this movie: some scenes, especially the action scenes were actually pretty good and visually pleasant, the movie has a solid amount of grit as well, also Ben Affleck's Batman was kick-ass especially on the warehouse scene but sadly all the good stuff ends there, moving on...

Now for the things I disliked and hated about this movie. For starters, the movie felt rushed and disjointed, it basically crammed multiple comic-book story arcs in one movie, the pacing was also pretty damn bad, going back and forth on scenes all of a sudden, not to mention the stupid amount of plot holes in this movie. I also hated how they handled most of the characters, especially the main villain Lex Luthor(Jr?) or should I say "discount Heath Ledger Joker", he was just an annoying character in this movie with no actual motive whatsoever and unlike the ACTUAL Lex in the comics who is manipulative, cunning and intimidating, he ended up as a weird, spastic, socially awkward twerp that isn't scary AT ALL. Then there's the cave troll looking Doomsday, just.... ugh, honestly speaking, he was basically shoehorned in the movie because of reasons unknown and the character was pretty much wasted in the end(great f*cking job Zack and co.). Lois Lane's character was pretty bland as well, she basically did nothing in the movie and her little adventure on finding where that bullet came from didn't help either and speaking of bland characters, Superman/Clark Kent was also quite shallow and like Batman, is brooding for most of the time ever since Man of Steel, even though his character is not intended that way(again, great job Hack), he wasn't even that much of a character in his own damn movie. I even have problems with Batman's character even though he was quite badass but where's that world's greatest detective I grew up with? he got outsmarted by a retarded version of Lex Luthor for Christ's sake, not to mention that this version of Batman has no willpower or essence of justice and won't hesitate killing those who he deems guilty, unless their mother is named Martha(don't get mad, I know the meaning of that scene but it's still stupidly executed). Maybe the only character I actually liked to the fullest was Alfred so kudos for Jeremy Irons delivering a solid performance on a not so solid movie, Gal Gadot was also decent as WW but in the end I didn't care for her that much, honestly, she felt kinda shoehorned as well but it was nowhere near as bad as Doomsfail though. The fight between Bats and Supes was also somewhat disappointing, yeah it has some awesome visuals and kick-ass cinematography on the beatdown but it felt REALLY short, it didn't even last 10 minutes yet they call the main title of this movie Batman VS Superman? should've called it BS instead and I'm not even gonna bother on that forced scene on how they made up since I already explained it. They even killed-off Superman already in this movie or did they? either way it was a bad move since they already murdered his character figuratively and literally, and even if he does come back which is highly likely as evident on that ending scene, it'll just end up cheap and remove most of the tension on the upcoming films with him since they already did the death of Superman storyline, so RIP.

Overall, I think Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was a not so decent film, was it bad? maybe, was it garbage? maybe not but it is indeed a disappointment to most comic-book and non comic-book fans out there, unless you're a zealot fanboy or you just enjoy watching these kinds of movies then I have no quarrel with you but I for one did not like this film and demand better quality than just basic fan-service. I just hope DC tries better on their next installations on their cinematic universe because I'm not too fond on how they're handling their movies right now.

There aren't any flaws in the movie it's just there was no time and  they have to squeeze all of these many stories together .If the movie  had been divided into two parts then it would have been better . Batman  had less action scenes then expected (or the action was so great the we  wanted more of it),hopefully we would see more of it in the director's  cut of the movie.I see the the negative reviews and I get it why  critics don't like the movie(too dark,no humor.bad writing,etc)but its  a good frickin movie,i just hope they do a better job in the coming  movies. 
I am happy because this was not like any marvel movie ,it was  completely different and as the fan of both the universes I will get to  see totally different types of live action movie of these universes
