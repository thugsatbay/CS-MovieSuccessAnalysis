### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I came into ParaNorman with a sense of cautious optimism. I absolutely adore stop motion animation, and I genuinely fell in love with Coraline, LAIKA's previous effort, but the trailers for the film didn't capture my interest in the story in the way I hoped they would and this film also didn't have the benefit of being helmed by the brilliant Henry Selick (Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Coraline). That being said, I am extremely happy to report that ParaNorman absolutely delivers on every level you could hope for. 

ParaNorman tells a story about a young boy named Norman who has the unusual ability to see and talk to the dead, an ability which has led him to be ostracized by the other members of his community, including his own family. The New England town in which he lives is famous for a historic witch execution, along with the legend of a curse that the witch put upon those who sentenced her to death. It turns out that the legend of the curse is true, and that Norman, with his ability to talk to the dead, is the only one who can prevent the curse from raising the dead. Unfortunately, Norman is unable to act fast enough and the Witch's curse begins to wreak havoc on the town. 

ParaNorman is a film with many strengths. Stop motion animation is always a beautiful and fascinating process, and with new technological advances the filmmakers have been able to bring it to a level of detail and expression that are simply astounding. While the scope of the story may be smaller than something like Coraline or Nightmare Before Christmas, the scale of the stop motion sets for this town are truly incredible. The film absolutely immerses you in this world that feels like a living, breathing, place. As beautiful as the animation in Brave was, ParaNorman is easily the most visually impressive film I have seen this year. 

As beautiful as the film is, it never falls into the trap of so many other animated films by simply being visual spectacle with no narrative soul. The story of the film is fun, intelligent, and heartfelt, and is supported by a great cast of characters. The odd kid who is misunderstood is a common trope in kids' movies, but what makes Norman stand out is that he's never mopey about it. He is ostracized, bullied, and rejected, but he's come to a kind of acceptance about the whole thing. He's certainly not happy about it, but at this point he's not trying to fit in, he's really just trying to keep his head down and get through the daily grind. This is part of what makes his relationship with the other characters in the film work so well. For instance Neil genuinely accepts Norman for who he is and it's obvious that this throws Norman for a loop and he doesn't really know how to interact with someone who "gets him." This is never spoken, but it plays out naturally through the performances of the characters. 

As the narrative progresses it takes some really interesting turns, and at times is genuinely surprising and emotional. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that a large part of the narrative revolves around assumptions and misunderstanding, and it brilliantly uses the audience's assumptions and expectations about the genre and its conventions against them. 

It's also worth mentioning that this is one of the rare films which decidedly benefits from the addition of 3D. There's some fun play with perspective, and being able to see the dimension that exists in these sets adds a lot to the experience. 

I genuinely loved ParaNorman and it's easily one of my favorite films this year. It's not a movie for everyone, but if any of the trailers gave you even a glimmer of interest I would definitely recommend checking this one out. LAIKA is certainly beginning to make a name for themselves in the animation scene and I'm really looking forward to whatever their next project will be. I think I still prefer Coraline which definitely benefited from the combination of Neil Gaiman's fantastic story and Henry Selick's experienced hand, but ParaNorman is a truly fantastic film and it's definitely worth a look.

This was a rather surprising movie. It's unlike any other modern  animated movie and picks a new sort of approach, that should work  entertaining for both adults and kids. 
There is plenty of 'simple' stuff to enjoy for young kids in this movie  but also the adults shall have no complaints about it. Throughout the  years animated movies often had both stuff for both kids and adults to  enjoy in this movie but I feel that the line dividing the two different  forms of entertainment is getting more and more blurry. Instead the two  things more often get effectively combined, with as a result more and  more movies get released that aren't being too childish for adults or  too mature for little kids. It's being perfect entertainment for just  about everybody! 
I do admit though that I was a bit surprised to see how horror  orientated this movie was. Make no mistake about it, this is a horror  movie. It might be a bit frightening for some children but obviously  most shall be perfectly capable of handling it. Fantasy and movies can  be a great outlet and also stimulant for children's imagination, this  also includes horror orientated stuff. After all, most kids are of  course perfectly capable of making a distinction between real stuff and  fantasy. 
And I do applaud this movie for not being overly fluffy or careful and  protective toward children. Not that that this is being a completely  dark, or scary, depressing movie to watch but overall it's being a tad  bit more dark and daring than just an average animated movie. 
It's really having a style and approach of its own, which just doesn't  goes for its story or the fact that this is being a more genuine horror  flick but also really for its comedy and characters. The characters all  feel rich and very much alive (yes, even the dead characters!) and the  humor is more clever and often dialog orientated, as opposed to having  characters jumping around and falling and bumping into stuff. In that  regard this movie also feels far more mature than just the average  genre attempt. 
And another important aspect about an animated movie; it's a really  good looking one! It's using stop-motion techniques and it shows that  this genre is far from outdated or dead. It's really something that  gives the movie an unique look and feel. I don't know, it's perhaps  pleasant that it's being something that allows the movie to feel 'fake'  and true exaggerated fantasy-like, as opposed to CG animated movies,  that are getting more and more smooth and realistic to watch. 
It's also a movie with a great underlying message in it, that tells you  it's OK to be different and there is nothing weird or wrong about it  and you shouldn't just judge a book on its cover. It's still too bad  this message was lost on some people and I'm talking about those who  had a problem with its ending. It was perfectly suitable and fitted  perfectly into what this entire movie was trying to tell you for the  first hour and a half. 
A surprisingly good movie in about every regard, that above all things  is being perfectly fun and entertaining to watch! 
8/10

ParaNorman looks like a throwback to the good old campy stop-motion animated films. The concept may not sound so original, but the designs and the themes of the story are the main appeal here. The movie is fun and wonderful to look at. While it goes through a crazy adventure comedy, there is a surprising twist that made this so endearing. It is something that we don't usually see in an animated film, but because of that we intend to love it. ParaNorman is funny, creepy, smart, and affecting.

ParaNorman is oddly different as an animated family film. Unlike the others, this one has a dark and mature context, but by sentimental means. Although the story is about spirits and zombies, the true core of this film is the emotion and the message that it is trying to show us. There's a couple of moments that are quite affecting. Usually is when Norman is being alone in his gloomy life. In other parts, the film is ought to be funny. The comedy sometimes feel way apart from the drama, but they still work anyway.

The stop-motion animation indeed looks marvelous. These little figures really brought themselves to life as their voice actors provide their personalities. The campiest part, the zombies, are quite impressive to look at. It's undeniably solid. The music score sure knows which part is suppose to be gloomy, campy, or just ordinary. It's a great effect to the scenes and you'll love it. The rest of the movie is all ridiculous and fun little set pieces that are entertaining enough to enjoy.

ParaNorman is surprisingly strong. The depth of the story made this movie so special. It's still filled with comedy and lightheartedness. In the end, it turns out to be endearing. It's a rare kind of family film that is brave to show what it wanted to show. It might be hard for some to understand its sentiment, but if there's anything else why anyone would like this film then it's because of its majestic animation. ParaNorman is simply great and it's easy enough to recommend.

Focus Features has only had two animated films up to this point; the beautifully crafted, but story-lacking 9, and of course the gorgeous and creepy Coraline. Now, this studio's third animated film gives us both a funny and creepy story about a town under siege by zombies and an ancient witch's curse. It's one of the best movies of the late summer, and should easily compete for at the Academy Awards for Best Animated Film. 

The film in itself is split into two sections. The first shows Norman, an out-of-place kid in a small New England town who has the ability to talk to ghosts. Since he has no real friends, he doesn't mind the undead. He's picked on at school for being different, and we see that whenever another person, like the geek Neil, wants to be friends with him, he tries to push them away. Norman's older sister, and Neil's older brother are the stereotypical cheerleader and football jock, and they torment Norman as well. And then we have the school bully; every film seems to have them these days. 

The second part of the film sees Norman become an unlikely hero after a witch's curse raises the dead back to life and all chaos breaks loose. There are some creepy moments, but the characters are always cracking off one-liners according to the situation, so it kept the film funny as well as adrenaline pumping. The only thing I didn't like about the story was the climax. It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it felt sort of phoned in. Overall, the voice acting is great, the animation is superb as always, and the 3D remarkably works well. I was expecting a great movie, and I got it with this film. It may be a little too scary for kids under the age of 10, but everyone else should have a blast. I hope this film does well, and I can't wait to see what Focus Feature's next big animated project will be. 

Final Verdict: 9/10

Another Animated Hit From The Makers Of Coraline!

A word of caution for parents with younger tots  'Paranorman' might  not go down too well for the faint of heart. But its deliberately  mature- skewing approach is also the reason why this is one of the most  unique animated movies we've seen this year, the latest feat of  stop-motion animation from the same Laika studio artists who had  conjured up the similarly bewitching 'Coraline'. 
Both have at their heart titular characters who are outcasts in their  social circle. For Norman, his ability to see ghosts have made him a  pariah among his schoolmates  and the worst of the lot is a  pea-brained nose-picking bully named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).  Home is not much better. His dad (Jeff Garlin) is none too pleased he  claims to be speaking to his dead grandmother, his mother (Leslie Mann)  dismisses it as a phase, and his bimbotic teenage sister Courtney (Anna  Kendrick) just can't be bothered.  
The film's writer is Chris Butler - a storyboard artist who honed his  skills on Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' and Henry Selick's 'Coraline' -  and his experience with the contemporaries in quirky animation has  served him well in creating a lovable adolescent misfit in Norman.  Before Norman is even confronted with the challenge you know will turn  him into the unlikely hero, you've already fallen in love with this  sweet unassuming kid with the rectangular quizzical eyebrows and a head  of vertical brown hair.  
Instead of sugar-coating the reality of Norman's social life, Butler  states the truth as it is  'You can't stop bullying  it's part of  human nature," says Norman's chubby buddy Neil (Tucker Albrizzi),  similarly ostracised in school on account of his size. The honesty is  refreshing, and so is the plot that follows, involving a 300-year old  witch's curse that invokes half-dozen zombies to rise from their graves  and terrorise the local townsfolk of Blithe's Hollow.  
A twist late into the tale on the witch's identity makes this an  unexpectedly moving and thoughtful parable on acceptance and empathy,  two morals which tie in beautifully with Norman's own story of  rejection. Along the way to the surprisingly intense finale, Butler and  his co-director Sam Fell inject a veritable sense of fun into the  proceedings which unfold like a roller-coaster ride into a haunted  house of terrors, made all the more enjoyable by Norman's motley crew  comprising of Alvin, Courtney, Neil and Neil's jockish older brother  Mitch (Casey Affleck).  
While distracting the younger ones with a cornucopia of visual gags,  Butler packs bits of surprises for the adults in the audience. You'll  chuckle along with the bits of deadpan humour  "Do you think they'll  eat our brains?" Alvin screams in fear. "Yeah, you'll be safe," Norman  replies  as well as the 'blink and you'll miss' tributes to horror  classics from 'Halloween' to 'Friday the 13th'. These will be lost on  the kids, but what parents should really take time to explain is  Butler's message of embracing those who are different from us, a lesson  all too precious in today's increasingly xenophobic world. 
The same attention to story and character has also gone into the  lovingly-detailed animation  while at first sight cruder looking than  today's more commonly seen computer-generated visuals, the distinctive  stop-motion rendering is nothing short of gorgeous, and one truly  marvels at the amount of effort that has gone into the individual  action-oriented sequences that have so much going on at the same time.  The technique has also allowed the animators to sculpt finer detail  into each of the characters, which come to life in a certain pop-up  fashion that fits perfectly in 3D.  
Using the traditional narrative of a misfit turned unlikely hero,  'Paranorman' weaves a fantastically dazzling, consistently engaging and  surprisingly touching story that qualifies it as one of the most  original and certainly one of the best animated movies of the year.  Yes, it isn't as family-friendly as something you might expect from the  usual Disney or Dreamworks fare, but you'll appreciate the level of  maturity and wit that has gone into this impressive stop-motion  animation.

Without spending too much time discussing the plot, this movie is essentially a film about a misfit kid who ultimately must save the town that has misunderstood and mistreated him for most of his life. Yes, Norman sees dead people. However, everyone is aware of Norman's claim of this power and they either ridicule him (other kids) or are ashamed of his seemingly wild claim and erratic behaviour. Of course Norman's extra-sensory powers will soon be required to rid the town of a curse. The resulting events make for a great story and film.

There are several themes in this film that were well developed and ultimately resolved to my satisfaction. The animation is incredible, and I loved the creative camera shots that the director(s) chose in many scenes: much more advanced than the usual animated film. 

I took 2 children to see this movie, a 6-year old girl and a (near) 4 boy. The kids loved the comedic zombie scenes in particular and were laughing out loud for much of it. They were frightened in other parts but in a functional thematic way, not to the point of nightmares. However I did note that some of the deeper themes went right over the kids' heads, and while they weren't too bothered by this fact, I advise that children over 8 might enjoy the film more fully.

The climax of the film is beautifully animated, and very poignant. On the whole a great film. I would state only that the humour surrounding the zombies was hilarious for adults and children alike, and I would have included more of it. Certainly this film is worth the admission. I saw it in 3D, it wasn't mind-blowing 3D but it certainly gave the film more texture.

Yes, like most "kids" movies, it had it's corny, funny, sometimes just plain silly parts, but... Paranorman left me pleasantly surprised. First and foremost, if you didn't like this movie because you compared it to Caroline, that's your problem. This movie stands well on its own and it's completely unfair to make comparisons. By the time the movie had finished, the beauty of it shone through and, without hesitation, I would say it stands up very well against "blockbuster" films designed for mature audiences. It's neither vulgar or obscene, but there are a few parts in the movie that will go straight over the youngster's heads but you will most certainly get it if you're over the age of thirty and haven't been living in a cave. If you take your kid(s) to see this, be ready; there are a few intense scenes that might have them a little frightened. Regarding the poor guy who didn't want to see the Expendables 2, I didn't see it, either, but I sure heard it. They poorly placed this movie the very next theater over from it.

There have been numerous stop motion animation films but only a handful have really stepped up to deliver something special. Coraline was one of those films that delivered unique characters along with a beautifully strange world like no other. Their latest ParaNorman looks to continue this tradition but turning to the ever popular world of zombies and horror. Can it deliver another new unique vision in this style or will it just end up being another generic animated film?

ParaNorman follows a misunderstood boy who is able to speak to the dead. When the town is over thrown by zombies, a witches curse, and an angry mob it's up to him to push his abilities to the limit to save them all. This film not only delivers something new and different with an almost played out genre, it manages to stand out and entertain on numerous levels. Featuring an all-star voice cast of Casey Affleck, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Tempestt Bledsoe, John Goodman, Anna Kendrick, Leslie Mann, Christopher Mintz-Plasse who step into their roles and bring these fun characters to creepy life. While this seems to be an animated kid's film, this was clearly made with all ages in mind. There are moments that some would deem not so kid friendly, but still manages to maintain its place among an almost all ages film. The animation is awesome with some strange character and set design that only adds to the originality and fun of this film. This film is formatted like an actual zombie film, but then takes some twists and turns to take it someplace new. The story is dark and fun all at once and will easily keep both adults and kids entertained. There are some classic monster movie moments that adults will appreciate as well as some subject matter that is a bit glossed over, but clearly takes a momentary step out of the family film.

This is easily not only one of the best stop-motion films to come along in some time; it's one of the best animated films. ParaNorman delivers in every way filled with comedy, horror, and action all wrapped up in a strange twisted visual tale that you will not soon forget.

Nine times out of ten, debating a film's appropriateness for children  is utterly pointless. But in the case of "ParaNorman," a 3D stop-motion  animated film about ghosts, zombies, and a witch's curse, I cannot help  but wonder what age group the filmmakers had in mind. With its morbid  imagery, its broad and occasionally twisted sense of humor, and its  handling of dark issues such as bullying, death, and the execution of  suspected witches, I'm forced to conclude that it may not be  appropriate for anyone under the age of twelve. You, of course, know  your children much better than I do. All I'm asking is that you keep  what I'm saying in mind as you buy tickets  especially if you decide  to shell out the extra cash for a 3D presentation. I should also note  that this is the first PG-rated animated film I know of to include a  gay joke. 
If you don't have any children and frankly couldn't care less about the  issue of how young is too young, you may find that "ParaNorman" is  wonderful-looking, appropriately scary, and a great deal of fun. For  someone like me, it represents a purer kind of horror movie, in which  the purpose is to frighten and entertain without resorting to tacky  marketing gimmicks like sex, nudity, and relentless gore. It's also not  limited to craft, although that certainly does play a major role; a  real story is being told, and it actually sends a message. I grant you  that it's not a particularly original message, but it's good to hear  nonetheless. Specific scenes are lovingly styled after schlocky B-  movies, while others feature clever insider references. Any dedicated  horror fan will be the first to tell you that the ringtone on the title  character's cell phone is John Carpenter's "Halloween Theme." 
Taking place in the New England town of Blithe Hollow, where a  notorious history of witch trials are now used to attract tourists, we  meet eleven-year-old Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), a  zombie movie fanatic cursed with the ability to speak with the dead.  He's surrounded by ghosts, all of which are only visible to him.  Because he always appears to be talking to himself, he's an outcast in  his community. At home, he's berated by his shallow teenage sister  (voiced by Anna Kendrick), patronized by his liberal mother (voiced by  Leslie Mann), and completely misunderstood by his overly stern father  (voiced by Jeff Garlin), who clearly doesn't believe in ghosts. He has  had it up to here with Norman making requests for his grandmother, who  has already died. This is true, but her spirit still lives in the  house, and she and Norman have regular conversations. Despite being  dead, the grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch) made a promise that  she would always watch over Norman, which is why she hasn't crossed to  the other side. 
At school, Norman is already an easy target for a bully named Alvin  (voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a brute and an idiot. Things only  get worse when he begins having visions, which invade his reality like  rips in the fabric of time. His only friend is Neil (voiced by Tucker  Albrizzi), an innocent and portly boy who takes his daily bullying in  stride and thinks Norman's ability is the coolest thing ever. One day,  they're both approached by the other black sheep of Norman's family:  His uncle Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), a hulking bum who  lives holed up in a dilapidated house in the woods. He soon drops dead,  although his spirit visits Norman in the boys' restroom and explains  that his visions are related to a curse put on Blithe Hollow by a witch  centuries earlier. This curse will take effect as soon as the sun goes  down; the only way it can be stopped is if passages from an old book  are read aloud at the witch's gravesite. Norman's sixth sense makes him  the only person qualified to do this. 
Inevitably, something goes wrong, and in due time, seven corpses are  awakened from their cemetery slumber. As they lumber around town as  groaning, rotted zombies, Norman, Neil, and Alvin team up with Norman's  sister and the object of her affection, Neil's teenage brother Mitch  (voiced by Casey Affleck), a dimwitted jock. Blithe Hollow's hall of  records is the scene of the finale, where an angry mob gathers on the  steps with pitchforks and torches. The zombies, meanwhile, are inside  and slowly closing in on Norman, who's close to figuring out the  meaning behind the witch's curse. What it really comes down to is  intolerance, ignorance, and the inability to listen to one another in  times of fear and confusion. True enough, these themes are far from  original, but they certainly add depth and even some sweetness to an  otherwise superficial tale of the macabre. 
For the most part, the film is in the spirit of fun, walking the fine  line between more mature thrills and family entertainment. There are  select scenes, however, that push the limits of where a PG-rated movie  can and should be allowed to go. The most glaring example is when  Norman must pry a book from the lifeless hands of his uncle  Prenderghast; as he struggles to free the book, the body is flung  around like a ragdoll, and eventually, it falls on top of Norman,  causing a huge length of tongue to roll out of the head and slap Norman  in the face. Had this been a live action film, this scene would have  been disgusting and perhaps even offensive. I believe that many kids  will greatly enjoy "ParaNorman," but I also believe that some of them  will find it frightening. Exercise caution when taking them to the  movies this weekend.

I love it. It answers the question, what happens when you put THE BREAKFAST CLUB, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and EVIL DEAD in a blender. You get this awesome movie from the makers of CORALINE. In a world dominated by CGI movies, this one is a breath of fresh air (the same applies to the upcoming film FRANKENWEENIE by Tim Burton). We have people with different personalities: the weirdo, the show-off bully, the cheerleader, the not-so-bright jock and the silly geek. Just like THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but they have to get along in order to survive, just like in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Also, a book is involved in it. A book just like in EVIL DEAD. There is a lot of thrills, chills (lots of them), and laughs (splattered (excuse the pun) here and there). Family appropriate? Of course! What do you think? A kid would be caught dead with an R-rated zombie film with over the top gore. It does a great job spoofing the genre. Give it a watch, I recommend it, it might prepare your kids into watching classic horror films (of course you know, viewer discretion is advised). Bottom line: It's good, give it a watch! Rated PG for scary images and some adult references, that might go over the heads of children under 13.

The movie gets a ten form me. Considering I love these kind of films. I know a lot of folks feel this movie might not be geared towards children under 9. I'm far from a prune, but I would not take a five year old but.............. then again, I've watch children and they are much smarter than we give them credit for. so point? Judge for yourself. There were kids in the theater that appear to be about five-ish or seven- ish and they knew when to laugh and really enjoyed themselves. So again if it just you you will love it. If you have kids under nine It would have to be on you to decide. but I hardly think this movie will turn your kid in to a thug, or the devil spawns. It a good movie.

The thing of it is, ParaNorman is pretty scary stuff for a PG movie, so you've been properly warned. This isn't some over-sanitized Disney movie. Everything from the lighting to the characters to the tense plot adds up to something you wouldn't want your six-year-old to drag you to, unless you don't mind paying for some therapy. But it's a terrific movie, with a style all its own and a madcap sense of ghoulish delight.

Norman (voice of Kodi Smith-McPhee) is an outcast. Know why? He talks to dead people. And indeed, we see them as well, chatting with our hero along his walk to school. Oh, and his grandmother (voice of Elaine Stritch) talks to him all the time while sitting on the couch in the living room. No one understands poor Norman, who's as resignedly freaked out as Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense, so he has no one to talk to, not his parents (Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann), not his sister (Anna Kendrick), and not the school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) for sure. 

It's only when Norman has an episode during the production of a school play (not coincidentally, about an old legend surrounding the town's dark past) that he gains a friend - another outcast, the portly Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), who teaches Norman that it's best not to let people bother you, to not let them get under your skin. Had the story ended there, we may have had a nice, tidy after-school special. Oh, but it does not! From out of almost nowhere, Norman's black-sheep uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman), a heavily bearded, slightly loony chap, informs Norman that he - Norman! - must take the mantle of He Who Holds Off the Witch's Curse. Mr. P. has been doing it for all these years, but he thinks he's about to go. He warns Norman that it's all up to him and he must read from the book and then he dies. That was an intentional run-on sentence, for your pleasure.

Thereby our plot is set in motion! Norman must extricate said book from the dead uncle and then read it by the witch's grave in order to break the curse that no one really believes is real. They don't believe it on account of Mr. Dead Uncle has been reading from the book for his entire life, and someone before him, and so on. But now Dead Uncle is, you know, demised, and just before the witch is to rise from the ashes and wreak havoc! Oh, I should note that the curse goes like this - a little girl was suspected of witchcraft by the town elders and sentenced to death. So you can see why she might want to haunt those elders and the town itself for all eternity.

There are people raised from the dead, and the imagery is quite striking; bones, stringy hair, rent clothing, and the ability to remove an appendage and reattach it. Are these - uh - zombies - out to lay waste to the town? Or are they victims of their own device? It's up to Norman, his brain, and his innate ability to talk to dead people to somehow save the day. Despite being grounded, of course.

ParaNorman works on many levels. Adults will love the stylish, almost Gothic atmosphere; older teens will love the menace of both the zombies and the townspeople, not to mention the witch herself. There are, for an animated film, plenty of scares and dark themes - slightly offset by the themes of loneliness, friendship, heroism, and getting adults to just listen to you. For once! Ahem. Anyway, there's a sort of beauty in ParaNorman, as horror and light comedy are somehow blended to form a rich animated film.

In Blithe Hollow, the outcast boy Norman Babcock lives with his father Perry, his mother Sandra and his teenage sister Courtney. Norman is considered a freak by his schoolmates since he speaks to the dead, including his grandmother that watches horror movies on television with him. However nobody believes that Norman has this ability besides his fat friend Neil. 

Norman's deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast meets Norman and tells that he must protect Blithe Hollow from the witch curse. Soon Mr. Prenderghast dies and his ghost explains to Norman that he should get his book and perform a ritual in the witch's grave. Norman finds the book that is a fairytale and then he goes to the seven graves where the men that condemned the witch are buried. However, Norman is interrupted by the school bully Alvin and the dead arise and invade the town. Soon Norman has a dream and finds that the witch is the girl Agatha that was sentenced to death in 1712 due to her medium ability. Now Norman wants to convince Agatha that her revenge is turning her equal to those who killed her. 

"Paranorman" is a stop-motion animation with a very funny supernatural story. Norman speaking with his grandma in the beginning and Mitch telling to Courtney that he has a boyfriend in the end are hilarious. The story has also a great message against the prejudice and ignorance. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): "Paranorman"

The makers of Coraline and the beautifully crafted but story-lacking 9 brought us another animated movie that did not disappoint. Paranorman was in fact a surprising movie. Unlike any other animated movie, this one picks a new sort of approach, that would probably entertain both adults and children.

The film was shot using a Canon 5D Mark II DSLR Camera. To generate the 3D effect, the camera was mounted on a special rig that would take one shot, then slide to a slightly viewpoint to take another shot. However, to generate all the different faces needed for the characters, the film company Laika used 3D printers.

The movie takes place in the creepy town of Blithe Hollow, whose name is a mash up of two other ghost stories, Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit(1945) and Washington Irving's The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow(1949). Paranorman tells the story of 11 years-old Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit- McPhee), who can speak to ghosts. Unfortunately, Norman has no friends because people think he's weird. Even his father (voiced by Jeff Garlin) regrets how his son turned out to be. The movie is a little too horror oriented, but funny and suitable for children nonetheless.

The characters are well drawn, so you can understand each of their personalities: you have the nice fat kid called Neil (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi), the usual blonde teen (voiced by Anna Kendrick), the bully (voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and the dumb jock (voiced by Casey Affleck). To be honest, my favorite was Neil.

To end with, Paranorman weaves a fantastically dazzling, consistently engaging and touching story. I really appreciated the level of maturity that has gone into this impressive stop-motion animation. A good movie in about every regard, that is fun and entertaining to watch, for both children and adults.

Agatha the angry ghost is magnificent. This whole movie is. The animation is amazing and the story will warm and break your heart. Good for those who love Burton and Selick, or just have a good imagination and a love for films. Unfortunately, I've heard a lot of parents say it was too scary and/or inappropriate for their children. To each their own. But for me, if your kids can't handle this, they're most likely too sheltered and scare too easily. Anything about this movie that adults deem inappropriate, kids won't even understand until they get older. This movie teaches an important lesson, and one even some adults need to re-learn.

2012 was an amazing year for animation. I absolutely loved Wreck-it- Ralph, Brave, Hotel Transylvania, Frankenweenie, Rise of the Guardians and even the not so loved Ice Age 4. ParaNorman is another fantastic film in the 2012 animation category. I'd rank it my 3rd favorite from the 2012 animation list.

This film came at a time when zombies are at their most popular in TV and cinema. However this film takes a zombie story and gives it a great twist and depth in its storytelling with meaningful and heartbreaking themes applicable in today's society. It has some pretty resonating messages about understanding, ignorance, bullying, bigotry, friendship and family and love. The anti-bullying messages are great and hopefully will register with our youth. All these messages are interspersed in a very much original story with sweetness and humor. 

Though at times the humor does get a bit PG and higher. So parental guidance is advised. It is a very mature story. Mature in that the humor can get a bit non-kid friendly with references to sex and to an adult film store, the F word and some more. So in this regard parental guidance is suggested but for teen and adult viewing, it is a fantastic film with perfect blend of storytelling, great messages, emotions and humor.

The film is very different from what we've seen and yet so familiar, i say that in a very good way. Essentially it has few minor elements of Ghost Whisperer, Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby Doo and the Witchs's Ghost, The Sixth Sense and more Scooby Doo and merges them into one but in addition it adds a lot and i mean a lot more to make quite an original story. See the mentioned films above and you will notice elements reminiscent of in this film. This film also is very witty with a lot of ironies and it parodies stereotypes in modern society which add to its humor. There were also references to some films of the horror genre of which i am not a fan but still caught a few.

The stop motion animation is very well done and is very lovely. The stop motion is excellent, colorful and has a large degree of detail.

Some people say it has dark themes, well personally if you watched Hocus Pocus as a kid and loved it, then you are sure to love this one since they have a lot of similarities.

'PARANORMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)

An Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Feature Film (of 2012), and one of the better reviewed movies of the year, this stop-motion animated film tells the story of a boy who can communicate with dead people who's called on to save his town from a 300-year old curse. The film was written and co-directed (along with Sam Fell) by Chris Butler. Butler worked on the storyboards for other spooky animated films like 'CORALINE' and 'CORPSE BRIDE'. This marks his feature film directing and writing debut. The film was produced over the course of three years at a studio in Hillsboro, Oregon and is the first stop-motion animated film to use a 3D color printer to create it's character's faces (and the second to be shot in 3D). The voice cast includes the likes of Kodi Smit-McPhee (of 'LET ME IN' and 'THE ROAD' fame), Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Leslie Mann, Jeff Garlin and John Goodman. I found the film to be a cut above the norm for this type of kid venture but not worth quite the critical rave it's received. 

The film revolves around a boy by the name of Norman Babcock (Smit-McPhee) who is gifted with the ability of being able to speak to dead people. His family and other townsfolk in the small town of Blithe Hollow don't believe he can really communicate with spirits though and he's seen and treated as an outcast freak. A fellow classmate, who's also an outcast named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), is the only one who believes Norman, along with Norman's uncle Mr. Prenderghast (Goodman). Mr. Prenderghast calls on Norman, one day, to protect the town from a 300-year old curse. Norman is informed that the curse was cast by a witch centuries ago and will bring about the living dead. Norman is reluctant to believe his uncle until zombies start walking the streets and it truly is up to Norman to use his special powers to save the day. 

I have a hard time getting in to animated kid's films like this (especially stop-motion ones). Usually due to the fact that these films are all filled with one-dimensional characters and lame kid friendly jokes. This movie definitely has it's fair share of both these things but it also has a little more character and emotional depth than most animated films of this type. It also plays some good homage to monster films and has a nice retro feel to it (at times). The music is spectacular and it is a little more creepy and mature than you might expect from the trailers. It also has been praised (as well as condemned) for having the first openly gay character in a kid's film (which I think is a very good thing). The movie still has it's flaws and it isn't as cool as critics make it out to be but it is a decent, better than average animated kid's film.

Paranorman, the new stop motion animated film from Laika Studios is an intriguing idea for a film that always falls just shy of its premise thanks to a lackluster script and some occasionally jerky animation. The film follows Norman, a lonely boy who can see and talk to ghosts. When a Witch's Curse from back in the Puritan days brings zombies back to life roaming Norman's town, it's up to Norman to save the day. The best parts of the film are the jokes making stabs at classic horror film clichés, such as the zombies being afraid of the humans trying to kill them, rather than the other way around. As well, the examination of bullying and its effects on children is handled fairly well through Norman's journey in the film, but where the film falls short is in all of the two-dimensional characters that surround Norman. All of the characters that surround Norman are Hollywood movie clichés, the jock, the bully, the dumb girl, etc. Then, add on to the fact that the animation of the characters is often jerky, looking as if the animators forgot to animate a few key frames, which in stop motion animation can be headache inducing, and you have a so-so film.

I give Paranorman a 4 out of 10!

I suppose this just isn't my kind of movie. I didn't care for Coraline either. While the animation is really good, as we have come to expect nowadays, and the voice-acting is first-rate, I just got really tired of watching ghosts chasing the boy during most of the middle of the movie.

I suppose my best synopsis is "tedious." It lasts for about 90 minutes but I found myself thinking it would have made a really good 30-minute movie.

I suppose my other issue is that ghost stories with children being able to see ghosts has become tiresome to me.

Paranorman tells the tale of Norman, who is afflicted with the strange 'power' of being able to see and talk to the dead. His local town is one full of legends and curses and with the help of a few semi-friends Norman is the only who can save it from a (not so) wicked witch.

Paranorman isn't quite a kiddie film. Sure, kids will enjoy the animation and a few of the more obvious physical jokes but the subject matter and tone of the film is a little too grown up. Lacking in Pixars fun and joviality Paranorman skirts off piste much like its well meaning but odd central character. Some kids wont get of the more subtle jokes or references (itchy weiners and the music) and i still find it strange that they made a kids film about zombies! 

I had the same feeling watching Monster House a couple of years back. Much like Paranorman, Monster House is bags of fun and its message is one that i really appreciate but i felt that it didn't need to be as grimmly told.

This horror-themed stop-motion flick is in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, though it wasn't directed by Henry Selick (it is from the same studio as Coraline and The Corpse Bride, Laika). It reminded me a lot of last year's Rango in that I liked it a lot, and really fell in love with its world, but I thought there was something lacking in the script. The animation is truly gorgeous, at least every bit as good as Coraline. The characters are beautifully designed and realized - even the writing behind them is quite good. The script as a whole, though... First off, much like Rango, this is primarily a comedy film, but the gags pretty much universally fall flat. The drama of the film, which involves the constantly bullied Norman using the gifts that make him abnormal to save the day, is a welcome theme, but it often comes off as heavy-handed. My favorite character was Norman's shallow teenage sister. She's well performed by Anna Kendrick, but it's the animation and design that really brought her to life (especially love the lip gloss - the detail in this film is really amazing). I'd still highly recommend this and rate it highly, even though I was a tad disappointed (of course I was expecting the second coming of Coraline - I guess I'll have to get my expectations stepped on again in a month or so when Frankenweenie is released!).

ParaNorman is a movie with a message. That message is Listening to Others is good. Fair enough. Good Message. But this movie isn't good. It's lousy. It hits you over the head with the message that no one listens to poor Norman and Norman doesn't listen to other people... in the first ten minutes. It then proceeds to reinforce that message by clubbing you upside the skull every couple of minutes with further examples of failed communication, inattentive parents & teachers, and over the top mockery.

The movie also makes a stand against reactionary mob mentality, both in the 300 year old judicial murder of the 11 year old "witch" of town fame and the modern townsfolk's panic at the rise of 7 zombies who hurt absolutely no one. And why does all this happen? Because no one is Listening! Weren't you listening? 

That said, the humor isn't funny, the acting isn't interesting, and the visuals? meh. They look like Jimmy Neutron, but less so.

Paranorman, the new stop action animated horror comedy, comes from the creators of Coraline, the 1999 Alice in Wonderland-like stop action animated feature, which garnered fairly good reviews. I faulted Coraline for its lack of originality and characters that didn't have enough charm. I'm sad to report that Paranorman represents a big step backward for the creators of Coraline, as it's much more derivative than its precursor and manages to exude significantly less charm.

The film starts off nicely as we slowly pan through the town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, which reminds one of a working-class section of Boston or any of those eastern or central Massachusetts towns that happen to feature rows of houses built in the 20s and 30s. We meet the film's protagonist, Norman Babcock, a boy with psychic powers who can communicate with his deceased grandmother inside the house as well as numerous ghosts out on the street. Norman is one of those 'misunderstood' kids who's ridiculed at school as a freak and forms a friendship with another outcast at school, Neil, an overweight kid, who is also constantly bullied.

In 'Coraline', most of the characters were eccentric but in 'Paranorman', except mainly for Norman and Neil, all the other characters, who are supposed to be funny, are actually either grotesque, mean-spirited or ignorant (some all of the above). The film's animators chose to highlight all the characters' negative attributes by exaggerating their physical deficiencies. For example, Norman's father, Perry, has an enormously protruding pot belly. He's also entirely unsympathetic as he considers his son's interest in psychic phenomena, an embarrassment to the family as well as the community at large. The Paranorman scenarists also fail to get any laughs from Norman's sister Courtney, who proves to be a caricature of a narcissistic teenager who's desperate to find a boyfriend. At the end of picture, we're supposed to laugh when she's rejected by Neil's older flat-topped, super-buffed Ron Howard looking brother, Mitch, who turns out to be gay.

Today it seems whenever we have a story about a young outcast, he'll always be pitted against a school bully. In this case it's Alvin, who sports a pig-like face and bears a faint resemblance to Bruce Willis. The obnoxious Alvin attempts to torment sensitive Norman until he realizes that everything his opponent is saying about a witch's curse that may destroy the town, comes true. Mrs. Henscher, the schoolteacher, is fairly amusing when she attempts to convince her school kids to emote better while they're performing a play about the 300th anniversary of the town, but later turns ugly (sporting a mud cake facial), joining a mob full of vengeful townspeople, who riot when faced with a group of hapless Zombies. There's also Sheriff Hooper, the overzealous police officer who thinks of shooting first and asking questions later (as the only African-American, some folks may find this character overly stereotypical).

Saving the worst character for last is Norman's deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who lives on the edge of town and resembles the town drunk--an individual who everyone in the town tries to avoid. Before Prenderghast has a heart attack and dies, he explains that the town is cursed by a little girl who was hung as a witch and took revenge on the seven Puritan townspeople from 300 years ago, who sentenced her to death. In an awfully tasteless scene, after Prenderghast kicks the bucket, rigor mortis sets in and the lifeless, stiff body falls on little Norman--who must extricate himself, not before being licked by the corpse's loose and gross, saliva-filled tongue.

In addition to all the unlikeable and charmless characters, there's also the amazingly derivative story line. Without the so-called comedy, 'Paranorman' would just be your average Zombie movie. The twist is that Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental. The Zombies were not originally a hate-filled mob who sentenced poor little Agatha to death--they were merely 'afraid'. And now Norman points out, the mob full of Blithe Hollow denizens, have becomes just as bad as their cowering ancestors.

Norman ends up by making everything right by engaging in a 'heart-to-heart' with the now demented and vengeful little Agatha. Once Norman gets through to Agatha, the souls of the seven Zombies, finally make it to their eternal resting spots (along with of course, little Agatha) and Norman's family and the rest of the town, learn an important lesson about being tolerant of kids with extra sensory abilities as well as Zombies who were not actually hate-crazed bigots, but merely innocently caught up in the mass hysteria of their times.

Now all that's left is to figure out how this hopeless production became a hit. Well, of course there are all those kids into zombie movies; but what about the critics? Sadly, many of the critics have the sensibilities of all those kids who bought the tickets. Alas, little Agatha is no more. If only Norman could have directed her to have those knuckleheads (aka 'the critics') give 'Paranorman', the rating it deserved. It looks like Metacritic's completely misguided '72', will remain Paranorman's ultimate final composite rating, for all eternity!

Why is Laika, the studio that has made Coraline and now ParaNorman, "Stop-motion's Pixar" ? Because after Coraline's perfect trip through fear and loneliness, it is time for Norman to impress us all ! 

Just like in Coraline, the stop-motion animation is gorgeous and dazzling. The characters are all beautifully animated and everything feels alive, unlike CGI movies that sometimes may look cold (I'm especially thinking about Dreamworks movies). 

The story of ParaNorman seemed a bit like a great-fun tribute to cheesy B-movies with funny characters. Well, it is by far better than this. The characters are deeper than I expected. And the last 30 minutes are incredibly surprising, thanks to a well-made twist unrevealed in trailers (which is really unusual nowadays) that leads to a fantastic, poetic and even sad climax. I'd say the final fight is the best of the year, by far.

To sum up, ParaNorman is a poetic, sometimes frightening and funny animation movie that everybody has to watch. It is at least as good as Pixar's best films, and I'm already waiting for the day ParaNorman will win an Oscar.

Much darker and more story-driven than most contemporary 'children's' animated films, ParaNorman is a well-written and well-crafted film. Norman can see dead people, of which there seem to be many, and thus ends up having to save the town from zombies, or (spoiler alert), as it turns out,vice-versa. While not new to this film, the 'monsters as victims' is a refreshing spin and provides the filmmakers with a lot of comic potential, as does the transformation the frightened townies into a demented mob. The voice talent is very good and gives the animated characters, despite being imaged in extreme ways, real humanity. One of the directors (Chris Butler) worked on Coraline, which I found extremely creepy and remains one of my favourite animated films. I'm surprised that at the relatively low IMDb score as the movie, which was well received by the critics, is clever, fun and well executed.
