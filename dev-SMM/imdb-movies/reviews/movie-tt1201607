### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.

The movie started off very well, starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.

*Spoilers!* 

The good: 

- Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.

- The Gringott's scene. Very well done.

- The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.

- The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.

- Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.

- Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.

OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.

The bad: 

- They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room, where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it, as I hope they would (I've always wanted to see the other common rooms), but then they don't. Hm.

- Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.

- Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini, and replaced in a different way by Goyle.

- Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories, because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change, in a different time era.

- Hermione and Ron battle Nagini, and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.

- There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is, until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird, considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.

- Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.

- The students are not sent home. No, the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.

- Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.

- Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.

- Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges (ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school).

- Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death = explosion into confetti!

- Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).

- Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No, instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates, really?

- All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.

- Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! 

- Too many attempts at one-liners and humorless jokes.

*End of Spoilers* 

All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action-packed as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with, learned to love, taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean, why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie, when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters, no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie, and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie, and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.

See the movie, and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie, just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die-hard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life.

I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!

The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. 

The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.

We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.

OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.

Spoiler alert: Just some scenes that could have been added or extended: Snapes memories- a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.

Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast, you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.

SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene, rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.

SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences, especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.

Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.

Should have shown more entities involved in the fight, like parents, Hogsmead residence, the elves as lead by Kreacher - rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.

MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.

The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.

OVer all, Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anti-climatic. DH2, sadly, was no different.

I saw this at a preview screening in London.

Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.

If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. 

There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. 

I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.

David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.

Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.

Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.

As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). 

Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.

What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.

Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.

Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10

Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.

But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. 

I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *

** SPOILERS **

THE GOOD :

- Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.

- Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.

- Gringott's scene was nicely shown.

- They added the scene where Hermione & Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.

- They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.

THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)

- My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories. 

- Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.

- The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.

- They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.

- They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.

- They wasted time in Nagini's chase.

- They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.

- No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.

- No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.

- No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.

- They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.

- Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...

- In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.

THE UGLY :

- Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.

- The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.

- Harry & Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)

- Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!

ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes...

I don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.

First off - Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.

What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anti-climatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn't quite do the job. Snapes "redemption" scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it's one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section (apart from Harry having clothes on...) My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war <- This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing - Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Aragog and just felt very anti-climatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him, and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes (its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle). The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.

My girlfriend hasn't read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I'm sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars, but I can't help but feel that another director/team could've handled this a lot truer to the books.

An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. 

Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.

Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.

There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.

But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. 

Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.

Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.

Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. 

The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.

They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.

That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.

Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.

I predict this will be the movie of the year.

I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like "That was great" and "Brilliant way to end the series".

Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you'll find it's easy to clue on whether you've read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.

The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.

Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.

My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn't know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.

By the end I couldn't even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn't even grasp everything that had happened which is why I'll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.

You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one.

This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.

I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.

First impressions of the film? Brilliant.

Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.

The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.

Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.

What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.

Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!

This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.

Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.

I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.

Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.

Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.

1) Dumbledore's brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.

2) The kiss. Didn't happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby's heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the "We're alive! Let's kiss!" movie cliché'.

3) Fred's death should have been on screen. Period.

4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn't make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?). What? 

5) The roles of Matthew Lewis and Evanna Lynch (Neville and Luna respectively) were enough to warrant their names as part of the supporting cast. To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.

(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) 

6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging. Except for maybe Ginny and Draco, none of them looked like they were 36.

I gotta chance to see this movie in 2D (Luckily) since i read the reviews of the 3D being bad . . but after seeing the movie even in 2D and witnessing the end of such an Enormous Mega Series . . i felt this was a very very disappointing end . . the HP Fans Have Been Robbed off their immense trust and money in seeing some modified illogical end to the story ..than what everyone had pictured in the mind after reading the Final Book of deathly hallows

(SPOILERS) HP Deathly hallows part 2 was very shallow. I was surprised that some REALLY special scenes from the book were excluded (robbed) off from the movie and instead they added their own new scenes which really didn't fit into any plot that was being brought up since 1st movie . . 

1)PLOT Mr. Yates . . i think the sole purpose of breaking this last movie in two parts was to do justice to the plot and build to an ultimate finale . what happened ?? I saw this movie with my sister who prefers to watch harry potter movies rather than reading the books . . so here i asked her a few questions after the movie 

Q:-How did harry survive after Voldemort killed him in the forest ? A:-I didn't understand

Q:- How did Dumbledore help harry understand the mystery behind hallows? A:-i didn't understand . . he never mentioned about hallows in Harry's dream

Q:-Who died George or Fred ? A:- They didn't mention it 

Q:- How did Percy come to fight ? A:- i don't know ..

Q:- What happened to death eaters ? A:- I don't know may be they ran out of fear 

Q:- Why did Elder wand didn't work for Voldemort ? A:- couldn't understand 

Q:- Who killed Nagini ? A:- Ron Hermione and Neville 

Q:- WHere were all the Hogwarts teachers ? A:- I guess fighting . . i saw them only once in a scene 

Q:- How did u feel after harry defeated Voldemort ? A:- Nothing special. . they didn;t show any Victory shouts or glory 

This clearly shows immense loopholes in the plot that Mr. Yates tried to explain in his own way . . but really it didn't work well

2) The Final Battle - 

It doesn't take place in front of everyone in the Hall . . In the book the whole magical fraternity witness the Epic Moment Harry and Voldemort in the centre circling each other and harry finally coming to terms and calling Voldemort . . Tom Yes I Dare . . Where The Hell Was This Scene? . . Death Eaters and Hogwarts Teachers . . Students . . Ron Hermione Neville Luna. . Kreachers army . . every one see Harry and Voldemort circling each other and Harry telling Voldemort . . I have knowledge of magic and a weapon more powerful than yours. . that wands choose their masters on their own. . that Snape was never yours he was Dumbledore's 

Nothing of this is in the movie . .Very Disappointing. .all that happens is harry and voldemort fight outside the castle and Voldemort curse backfires,and he turns into smoke . .what nonsense 

3)Dumbledore's Scene

Dumbledore doesn't explain why harry doesn't die after Voldemort killed him . .this is where the whole plot and mystery of entire Potter Series is to be explained . . the elder wand killed only the Horcrux inside harry and how Harry's blood still runs in the veins of Voldemort and so he'll be able to return back

Dumbledore doesn't explain how he was destined only for the elder wand because he was meant to tame it . He doesn't explain at all why only Harry was worthy to posses all the three deathly hallows . . because he is not scared of death . . instead accept it as a friend . . and becoming a true master of death. Giving movie the title The Deathly Hallows . . ask yourself truly what did they do in the movie ? . . Nothing

4) Lack Of Emotion and Glory 

The Trailers say very bright and Loud 'THE Epic Battle' . . ask anyone who saw the movie 'Did it actually feel that epic ??? Did they feel for the characters during the movie ? In the book . . everyone run towards Harry . . Ron and Hermione lift him up they hug him . . there are cheers and cries of Victory . . Glory.. Harry Ron and Hermione go into Headmaster's Office . .where they are welcomed with a standing ovation of Victory . . An Epic Feeling that something huge has finally ended . . 

In the movie . . you don't feel anything . .Harry just walks by in the hall and no one looks at him until Ron and Hermione . . Then he takes them to the bridge and tells them about the Elder Wand and breaks it . .Ha Ha Ha. . Come on Mr.Yates

5) Background Music 

Imagine huge action scenes without a thrilling background music. . neither rejoicing nor scary . . That is not how you make things EPIC.I think the music given to the trailers was really perfect . . it set theme for the final battle . .it was no where in the movie 

Over all i think the movie could had been done a lot better if some plots would had been explained properly .

For those who haven't read the book . . its a Visual Treat 

For those who have read the books . . this is Severe Disappointment for their favourite series to end this way . .

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene, then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval, coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.

Harry, Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible  unless you know a goblin who worked there, which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts, they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn't know, the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.

Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level, they added their maturity to their characters. It's very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless, captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione. 

Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince's Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.

Professor McGonagall takes a stand  several, actually  in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does, the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her, as she sees all the work that they've done go to waste 

And what better actor to portray this generation's most bad-ass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak, seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie, another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. And yet, there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic, indeed.

Steve Kloves is the movie's screenwriter. He captured the movie's essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths, the destruction, the revelations, the build-up. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling's magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again, I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. "Look atme." Enough said.

Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first (Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great), he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn't any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren't ending

We've been to the first session (virtually) of each Harry Potter movie. You expect the movie to never be exactly like a book (when is it EVER?!) but this one really did change a few things that shouldn't have been touched.

There was a lot of good work in this movie. Lily, James, Sirius and Remus joining Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest was well kept. The acting was impressive as usual, something one has come to expect from this group. The visual effects were also excellent, and the storyline was well followed up to a point (this is why the movie got 7/10 from the writer); however, when major changes to this occurred, disappointment set in.

The lack of use of the Invisibility Cloak (which we all know is one of the most important hallows to possess) by Harry throughout the movie (except for when they are at Gringotts) is puzzling, as he used it extensively to get around Hogwarts so he could manage to obtain the diadem horcrux as well as make his way to Voldemort within the Forbidden Forest. Also, when Harry 'falls' out of Hagrid's arms out in Hogwart's grounds (when all Hell breaks loose due to Nagini's demise) he uses the Cloak to escape and cause panic amongst the Death Eaters.

Also, the fact Harry didn't tell Neville it was imperative Nagini needed to be killed, but Hermione instead, diminishes Neville's importance! In the book, it is completely up to Neville to destroy Nagini as he is the only one left who it is thought to be able to. Also, it can be tied into the prophecy that Trelawney made all those years before as Neville killing the final horcrux, causes Voldemorts vulnerability. Thankfully, Neville is the one that kills Nagini, but more by luck than good management.

Harry telling Dumbledore that he had nothing to kill Voldemort with (at Kings Cross Station) was not correct, as well, as he went into the Forest with both the Cloak and a wand, which was what made him so special as he did not raise that wand against Voldemort. He instead died willingly, again showing his great strength and love of those important to him - his friends/family at Hogwarts.

The adaptation by the screen writer, Steve Kloves, of the final scene between Voldemort and Harry of the novel - well...THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! What J.K Rowling wrote was good enough and whenever I've read it I've always loved it and pictured it so clearly in my mind, so the whole battle scene between Harry and Voldemort was ridiculous, and could only occur because they ruined the sequence of events. VERY UNNECESSARY! The wands locking in battle  what the???? That should not have occurred, as they had different cores, different timbers and were nothing like the Twin Core Phenomenon that occurred in book four (Goblet of Fire). You don't even hear Harry say Expelliarmus which had become his 'trademark spell'.

Harry, Ron and Hermione not going to the Headmaster's Office after defeating Voldemort, and there getting a standing ovation from all previous Headmasters and Headmistresses, and Harry not mending his phoenix feather core wand through using the Elder Wand (Death Stick) was very much an anticlimax. Instead, Harry (in the company of Ron and Hermione) snaps the Elder Wand (the possibility of which I would think is questionable in the first place!) and chucks it off the bridge (never to be seen again?).

It would have been nice to have had the connection between the Dumbledore's and Grindelwald explained, especially Adriana's death. This actually moulded Dumbledore into the man he became - a professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts; never Minister of Magic; and a supporter of Muggle-born witches and wizards. It also explained how he came into possession of the Elder Wand.

I was so glad, and there was applause in the theatre when the epilogue occurred as its lovely to see Albus Severus Potter and the short conversation between him and his father, Harry.

Overall, probably not one I will see again at the movies, which is something I have done with the others (though they were disappointments in ways as well!).

Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.

Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.

The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.

No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.

For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.

SERIOUS SPOILERS INCLUDED ***************************** David Heyman, the Producer of the Harry Potter films, made the single biggest mistake of his career when he decided that the Director of each film would be offered the opportunity to direct the next. Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.

Then David Yates entered the scene and proceeded to dramatically change the feel of the films. For lack of a better word, the "magic" was expunged and everything took on a more "realistic" look. Films 5 and 6 were terrible compared with the books. I initially blamed 5 on the fact that Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay, but I now know I was wrong.

The film of Deathly Hallows, Part I was OK, but it was simply the setup for the emotional second half.

I just saw Deathly Hallows, Part II this evening and I was speechless. In addition to adding useless parts to the narrative, critical emotional scenes were eliminated (e.g. final conversation with Dumbledore and the final conversation between Harry and Voldemort/Tom Riddle where Harry gave Voldemort on last chance to find remorse).

Yates even managed to suck the life out of one of the most exciting moments in the book, where Molly Weasley intervenes to save Ginny from Bellatrix and yells "Not my daughter, you bitch!" In the film, Molly calmly makes this statement as if she is some western gunfighter.

The final scene between the 3 main characters (not including the epilogue) had NO life at all.

David Yates - shame on you.

Thank goodness we will always have the books.

Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of "The Two Towers" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director.

If I was to think of this and part 1 as one long movie, it'd be a 7/10. However it's not and part 2 was a shadow of the first. A real 'hollow' film that seemed rushed and had no great emotion or character depth which, to me, is what the final film should consist of the most. 

The bad. 1. Goblins getting stoned from spells. 2. No real dialogue between any of the characters 3. Harry snaps the most powerful wand ever, with his bare hands after Olivander makes wands seem like living things earlier in the film. But yeah. He just snaps it. Poor storytelling. 4. The only good thing in the film (Snape's memory) was rushed. 5. Bad humour to break the tension when the tension should not have been broken. It is meant to be a dark film after all. 6. Not showing characters deaths. Which one of the Weasley's died? I challenge anyone that hasn't read the book to answer that. They showed no close up and didn't really give any notification as to who it was, except for maybe once. Which doesn't really give the characters justice and makes them seem worthless. 7. The Death Eaters just leave and I'm left asking..why? Why is this not explained? 8. The Elder Wand should not duel against it's master Harry, I thought? So why did it do so once the part of Voldemort was out of Harry and just before Nagini was killed? It's as if it went, oh, Nagini is now dead. Voldemort can die. Let's deflect the spell onto him now. So stupid. Substituting suspense with a consistent plot. 9. You'd expect some interesting words from Harry and Voldemort, especially since their feud has been hyped up for 10 years. There was none of that. 10. No screen time for anybody except Harry and Voldemort. 

The Good. 1. Voldemort walking through blood in his bare feet talking to Nagini in parsel tongue. It was dark and brilliant. If there rest of the film had continued like that, it would of been a lot better. 2. Snape's memory. It contained emotion and served justice to the character. Which no other character truly got in this film.

There's loads more bad things about this film. But it's annoying me just thinking about them. There is not other good things I can think of. I feel robbed as a fan of previous films and a fan of the books. 1.

What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!

BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.

Go see this movie!

Yesterday i went to a private screening of the movie and here is what i though.

Harry potter and the deathly hallows is the final volume in the award winning Harry Potter series and boy does it have a good send off. The acting, as usual is sensational and very convincing. Ralph Fiennes does a really amazing job at playing Lord Voldemort as he has done in all the previous movies.Lord Voldemort gets a lot of screen time and you should be please because he is really great.Also as usual, Daniel Radcliffe, Ruper Grint and Emma Watson are great as Harry,Ron and Hermione.Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best choice that could be done for the character as he is nearly exactly what i was imagining what he would be like when i read the book. I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous. Michael Gambon is, as usual, a great Albus Dumbledore.Maggie Smith does a very very good Prof McGonagall...well you will have to see the movie to know what i mean but i am pretty sure you will like everything she does ! The film takes quite a few liberties from the book but to be honest, thats fine with me..one of the prime examples is the scene in the trailer where Harry and Lord Voldemort seem to hug and jump of a roof. In the trailer it looked odd and out of place but in the movie it looks pretty good and a lot less odd.The Battle for Hogwarts takes up about half the movie and is pretty spectacular and on a pretty large scale..well as spectacular as a PG-13 can be..there are so many explosions and things going on at the same time and it is just pure chaos,as the book intended i am sure, and its plain old fun to watch.Quite a few things happen in the battle that do not happen in the book but to be honest thats fine...doing a 100 percent adaptation would be a tough task and might not be as fun to watch.The movie does a great job, as the others did, at being funny seconds after a emotionally charged scene..and there are a lot of them ! I heard quite a bit of crying in all the moments you can imagine (if you have read the books) and also a lot of laughing.The special effects where very impressive, and well made if not a little over used.My only main problem with the movie is it did not need to be 3D.quite a few of the effects where clearly just to say look at me i am 3D !! It just did not feel needed. The sense of danger that Harry and crew face is very real and the director did a great job at making sure you are kept on your toes.The film is definitely the darkest in the saga so far and has quite a few intense scenes..Knowing how uptight censors can be its good that it gets away with a PG-13..I am trying to do the review without giving away too much because i am not keen on giving spoilers away at all but if you have any questions just ask and i will do my best to answer them. If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, you will most likely love it and it will be a whole bunch of fun.if you hate changes being made to the book chances are you will not love it so much...It may have a couple of flaws, which i am going to address below, but other than that its what it should be; a whole bunch of fun and a pretty good send of (or is it the end?) for the saga.The final scene is sweet and in all a good ending. When i left the theater it felt quite surreal as i have been nearly growing up with the Harry Potter saga, and it made me sad to know it was over..or as David Hayman said in the speech he gave before the movie, The end is just the beginning.

My final thoughts on it are that its a pretty amazing end to a pretty amazing saga. (i am trying to improve my reviews little by little)

Yes this film has amazing special effects, and the Hogwarts fight really keeps you on edge for the entire film. The fight between Voldemort and Harry was really well done, even though it deviates from the book, but being a film it has to.

Where this film loses point is where it omits far too much from the book. This goes for the Half-blood prince too. In fact, I think all of Yates' films follow this pattern:

I know they have to make some tough choices by cutting out what is not really essential. Though an extra 10 minutes would not have hurt. Dumbledore's past is only slightly hinted at in both films, but never explored. Leaves you wondering why they even bothered to mention it in either film. One thing I was really looking forward to was the fight between Dumbledore and Grindewald in a flashback of some sort. Aberforth neglected to mention anything though. I was also looking forward to the three-way duel between Voldemort, McGonnagal and someone else (I can't remember who), but that was also omitted. 

The Deathly Hallows aren't really explained, we never know that Harry's cloak is one of them, or that Dumbledore possessed all 3 at one stage. Makes the film's name seem a little pointless. Horcruxs are also rushed. No explanation for their significance. Also, why Harry is able to go back to life, the significance of Voldemort using Harry's blood back in film 4, is all left out. 

Most disappointing of all, is the ending. When Frodo destroys the ring, the movie doesn't just end. But when Voldemort dies, the movie ends a minute or two later. Lets not forget the 100s of death eaters that are still alive....what happened to them? There's no happy endings, rejoicing, no thankyous, nothing. 

This is another point where I think Yates gets it wrong. There really is no interaction between Harry, Ron and Hermione. In fact, Harry doesn't have much dialog either. He doesn't even look at his Dad in the forest. This really make the film feel rushed. As I said, once Voldemort dies there really is nothing else. You kind of expect some sort of happy ending with Hagrid, the Weasleys, the Gryffindor kids. 

But look, the film was still pretty good. I give it a 7 out of 10 and there's a load of review that will tell you why. Go read those. 

Also, the giants looked stupid.

As many people have already seen, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is out in Theaters. I will not spoil this film for you if you have not seen it yet. I will let you form your own conclusions as to whether you wish to see it or not.

As everyone knows, this is the last film in the Harry Potter franchise, started 10 years ago with Mr. Chris Columbus at the helm. Many people credit the third film of the series, Prisoner of Azkaban, as the moment the franchise went from made for children to a more mainstream, mature audience. I have to give major credit to Mr. Columbus though as without him, the visions, actors, and feel of what we know within the films would not have been created. 

Several years later, we are at the end of an epic journey. We have laughed, cried, looked on with awe and inspiration. Mr. David Yates returns to his role and directs a wonderful end to J.K. Rowling's loved works of literature. 

To explain how I felt while watching this film is difficult to achieve. I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story. Star Trek (2009), Inception, and Avatar are a few of the movies in which I have found myself repeat visits due to wanting to see parts of the movie that I have missed along the way. 

The film takes you on a roller coaster ride starting off slow, until you reach the first action sequence, then rushes headstrong into another series of scenes, focusing mostly on Harry and his charge of destroying the horcruxes. This is Harry's story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. 

Along the way, several characters stand out. Nevil Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) makes a stand and Professor McGonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie.

I have to applaud Alan Rickman for his portrayal of Professor Snape. He has always amused me in every movie and he doesn't fail here. Another film to see how great of an actor he is (besides Die Hard and Galaxy Quest); Bottle Shock.

Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialog didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me.

If you read the books, which I am sure most of you have, the story doesn't follow the book as well as it did in Part 1. I have yet to see any movie adaption of a well loved book ever faithfully follow the book to the letter. Even Game of Thrones didn't follow the books to the letter, but it did a good job. 

Enjoy the movie for what it is: A satisfactory end to a magical, coming of age, story.

First of all I must explain that I am a huge fan of the books. They practically taught me to read. This is perhaps why I found the film so devastatingly disappointing. It is worth noting that if you have never read the book you may find this film to be entertaining.

The good: -The scene with the room of requirements is very accurate and entertaining. Especially with Harry saving Malfoy and Crabe dying. 

- Helena Ravenclaw, he scene was spooky and pretty much the same as the book. However it just seemed so rushed.

- Neville was pretty much spot on. Just not enough air time.

- The Gringott's scene was accurate, but again so very very rushed. 

And that's pretty much it for the good.

The Bad: -The constant pointless inaccuracies to the book. I'm well aware that things must be adapted when making a film from a book. But here they seem to change so many things, some important some not so important, for no particular reason. For example some of the Hogwarts students SEEM to be living in the room of requirement, so they can hide from Snape but they still go to the great hall, when he calls them. And when the battle for Hogwarts is about to begin, instead of evacuating all the under aged students out of the castle, they are allowed to fight, and the Sliverins are just kept in the dungeons. I won't list them all, as there are far far far too many to mention. But this is the main thing that really lets the film down.

-Bits of the story that they failed to mention earlier in the films just appear out of no where, and carry on as if we've known about them all along. For example the ghost of Lupin talking about his son. Nowhere in the films is it mentioned that he has a son, and its actually a fairly big part of the book. 

-Fred's death is skated over very quickly. This is so disappointing, because in the book this is pretty much the biggest death. But before you know it, its over and Fred is never talked about again.

-There is hardly any talk about the deathly hallows. No wait scrape that, there is pretty much NO talk of the deathly hallows, and it's the title of the FILM! Not even Dumbledore talks about them, and that is such a massive part of the book, and a massive part of Dumbledore.

-The entire film should have been called "Harry and the lost Cameo" because that's what it is! Every other actor just seems to have cameos. 

- Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).

-Absolutely no Dumbledore back story. This is just such a huge part of the book.

-The final fight scene Between Harry and Vol is just completely inaccurate. The whole point of Harry being the master of the Elder wand but not possessing it is that Vol can't cast any spells at Harry, and there he is shooting all sorts at him.

-Voldemort's death is pathetic, plus its meant to take place in the great hall were everyone can see it. 

-One of the worst parts of this film is the epilogue. It takes place 19 years into the future. So I hoped they would have used different actor. NOPE instead they made a very poor attempt at ageing them all, by making Harry and Ron Fatter and Ginny and Hermione just plain frumpy. It's a horrible way to end a hugely disappointing film.

I can't believe the film is being so well received, and I really can't believe that J.K. Rowling is happy with this film. If you're a lover of the books then please don't do it to yourself to watch this film. Just read the book again.

Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. 

Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. 

Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.

But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.

But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.

My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.

My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. 

In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 

8.5/10.
