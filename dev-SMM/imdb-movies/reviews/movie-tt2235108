### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I give this movie an 8. It is funny, but can be uncomfortable at times. Its a movie I do not expect everybody to get. Like Spike Lee's do the right thing, It will make some feel uncomfortable and immediately go on the defense- which in turn makes them not appreciate the comedy the writing, the cast or the message.

This movie shows real people, real thoughts, real characters. It not glossed over , sugar coated characters ( nor extremist).

The movie offers different view points on what it is like to be a black person in this suppose to be "post racial" country that we live in.

I would give it a look, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

Went into this hoping for the best, but was sadly disappointed. This kind of mockery would be called criminal if it was titled Dear Black People. Taking 5 years to write this, Simien obviously did no research into actual college campus life. It looks as if he was given carte blanche by the divisionist government agenda that keeps racism alive and well in this nation. None of the comedy is witty let alone remotely funny. The satire that liberal critics elude to is fairytale hate that no student in the past 50 years would even dream of doing. One critic even wrote, "A smart, hilarious satire of the Obama age." All actors in this movie are too talented for hate speech such as this. This is yet another attempt to separate people and ideals and set civil rights back to when Muslims first sold Africans to the Europeans. Seriously, people need to check themselves and get backbones for calling this funny, smart, or witty. Martin Luther King would be rolling in his grave if he knew his struggles for peace and equality culminated in this. Spike Lee, in all his divisionist hate, could not even remotely touch this absurd delusional myriad of vile hatred. Watch this as a warning of what's to come in the future of left wing agenda films.

Dear White People is a quick-witted film with a provocative title. For those who have not seen the full film, there is definitely more to it than what's revealed in the trailer. Initially focusing on race, the film goes deeper into the unexpected and unique aspects of each character, uncovering more than what's just skin deep and taking a look at identity. It's a very interesting movie about self acceptance in a world where issues around race, sexual orientation, and general stereotyping still exist. This film is much more than a black film about race issues in America. I highly recommend it for folks who are interested in a bold film with great dialogue and archetypal characters turned multidimensional.

DWP is the feature directorial debut for Justin Simien, having previously raised most of the film's budget from the crowd-funding site Indiegogo. The film is a satirical story about a group of black students at a fictitious Ivy League school where tensions reach a boiling point when white students throw a black, "ghetto themed" party. To be blunt, I didn't like the movie. I went into it with a "sock it to me attitude." What I got was a watered down wannabe Spike Lee joint. It's clear that Simien is a Spike Lee fan right down to the directing style, but when it comes to the in-your-face attitude, it falls flat. The "show down" at the aforementioned party was a joke. Some bottles were broken, a few stereo speakers knocked over, and a face was punched; that was about it. The one star that shined from the movie was Tyler James Williams, formerly from Everybody Hates Chris, playing the socially awkward, gay character, Lionel Higgins. He just wants to be himself while cliques try to claim him as their own. Do yourself a favor and watch, "Do The Right Thing" instead.

To be honest the movie was not all that great. I was really excited for it at first. It's severely over-hyped by my community. Even though it was a satire it failed to portray African American appropriately and was pretty prejudicial towards the White community. and Asians at one point. Additionally the acting was subpar, jokes were flat. All the best scenes were already shown in the trailers. This movie was supposed to bridge a gap and instead it helps instigate the already hostile race relations in the US. Some of the statistics also mentioned are purposely misguided and slanted or taken out of context. I thought the movie would be fair in this regard. 

I was really disappointed. Given the cost of movies too these days and how far you might have to travel to a theater it's playing in you should probably wait for it to be OnDemand if you're to see it at all.

I didn't even finish the movie.

I thought I would give it a chance. I wish I never watched 1 hour of this movie.

First off, it is not funny whatsoever. The dialogue is horrendous, it's really just reference after reference - Exposition after Exposition. The characters are flat. The plot is silly.

The main character is just straight up confusing and unlikeable.

Also, this movie is very racist...against Black people. If a White person would've made this movie, it would have been up there with Birth of a Nation.

Who hyped this movie and thought it was good? It's bad. Very bad. Nothing about this movie is smart, nothing about this movie is funny, nothing about this movie is political and nothing about this movie is Black besides the person who made it and the characters in it.

There are plenty of other black films out there that really entertain and sometimes make a point about race perceptions and relations. (see last paragraph)

The filmmakers scripted a real life situation, A racial Halloween Party in Texas...how boring can you get. Whites in black face... zzzzz..huh, oh I fell asleep. Why make a movie about one incidence of jerky white guys.

Then the movie turns into a black Dinner with White People where people chat on and on.

If you are into b/w dialogue just listen to the audio. Nothing to see here except a few very hot sorority girls. The filmmakers must have said, 'let's bring in comments on 'the weave'. Sorry Chris Rock did an entire documentary and it was great.

Was Dear White People a class project? What was the point. "Hey some fraternity dudes can be assholes." Big surprise.

Rent Hollywood Shuffle by Robert Townsend and then check out the reset of his film. He is good.

Actually, I don't understand this film, I mean the story, what it intended to tell us. Maybe it's for Americans only. I thought it could be some underrated cool comedy, but what I just saw was definitely not expected. I kind of felt it was a student politics and if it stayed like that way I would have had no problem. But they said it is a comedy and I did not get any, in between it became a racism thing. I never understood this American racism, why they're making it so complicated. Especially the condition of the US is not looking good right now and this film pours a more oil to it. I'm neither white nor black or an American, and sorry I did not find it a good film. Even more, I don't get, how a television series is getting ready to follow-up it. So no offense for those who liked it, seems I'm in a wrong place. I just rated and reviewed what I felt it deserves, other than that I'm not against the film. I'm out of here!

Dear Brown People...Yes, I see I have already offended some people with this title. I made myself set through the whole monotonous film trying to something out of it. It just didn't happen. It was like an after-school special that was an hour too long. I believe Justin Simien had to create this movie to remove some pent-up emotion from some traumatic racial episode he has had in the past. I am giving it a 3 only because I am feeling in a generous mood today. I believe Rodney King could have created a movie called 'Can't We all Just Get Along' and it would have been ten times more entertaining than this depiction of racial hatred. I had a bad feeling those who were not singing 'Follow the drinking gourd' in the theater might be escorted out...

As a human being who HAS experienced and seen racism and bigotry, I can tell you these little morons have no knowledge of anything except their entitled, selfish, little selves.

It was in fact one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When enemies of the United States see something like this, it confirms their opinions of us -- stupid, prejudiced, drug-using, taking a college education for granted, and completely oblivious to what the world is suffering through right now. I see some of my Vietnamese friends holding down two jobs and going to school in the evening to get engineering degrees, then supporting huge families. This movie, being a spoof or whatever, was just plain terrible. If the director does have talent, he should use it in a positive way, rather than showing drugs, sex, fanatical partying and violence. Please don't waste your money.

'Dear White People' is first time writer/director Justin Simien's clever and provocative take on how young black students cope with the issue of assimilation on the majority white (fictional) Winchester University campus. The title refers to a radio show hosted by Sam White (played by the excellent Tessa Thompson), a militant student, who delights in slinging bon mots at the collective white student body. 

She comes up with witticisms such as "Dear White people: the minimum requirement of black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two." And then tops it off with, "Sorry, but your weed man, Tyrone, does not count." Other sharp-tongued epithets include: "Dear White People, dating a black person just to p-ss off your parents is itself a form of racism," and "even if Obama cured cancer, white people would still be enraged with him. And he's only half black."

Sam and her Black Student Union supporters are not always averse to being critical of black cultural icons such as Tyler Perry: "Can we have movies with, you know, characters in them instead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma?" And Sam isn't always who she appears to be: although a self-proclaimed bebop aficionado, someone outs Sam for having Taylor Swift on a hidden playlist in her computershe blurts out: "And I was so careful." What's more, her white boyfriend, an RA in the dorm, is kept hidden from her BSU pals.

Simien is less successful with some of the other characters as they're not fleshed out as well. Sam's rival Troy and his Dad, Dean Fairbanks, have a pretty traditional father-son conflict, over the son's plans for the future. Then there's Colandrea 'Coco' Conners (the anti-Sam) who's changed her name to 'Coco' because Colandrea sounds too "Ghetto." She's trying to up her profile with a producer who's looking for actors in a potentially new reality show he's created; and showing up at a 'African- American themed' party (put on by the obnoxious University President's son, Kurt) is all part of her plan for upward social mobility. Insensitivity seems to run in the family, since Kurt's father, President Fletcher, declares that racism no longer exists in America, except maybe against Mexicans! But these one-liners are not enough to create, dynamic, multi-dimensional characters.

Finally, there's the ultimate outsider, the black and gay Lionel who angles his way in at the student satirical newspaper, Pastiche, in order to cover black student life on campus. Lionel doesn't fit in with the Black Student Union (they're not crazy about his homosexuality) and the white kids run their fingers through his Afro as if he's a child (one female student tells Lionel that he's black but only "technically"). 

The main plots in the film involve the University's desire to desegregate the traditional black residence hall which Sam is determined to prevent. Through some kind of computer chicanery, Sam is elected president of the residence hall, defeating Troy. 

The climax occurs when Lionel flips out at the 'black-themed' party thrown by a gaggle of insensitive white students dressed up in black face. After trashing the room, including expensive audio equipment, Lionel and others are brought before an administrative hearing. Sam is tongue-lashed by the University President but the Residence Hall remains all-Black. Sam seems to have misgivings at getting too political and it appears she'll be moving off-campus next semester. 

I'm not sure if Mr. Simien is more interested in proffering an angry lecture about race relations disguised as comedy or truly delivering a well-aimed social satire. Maybe he's achieved both. See Tessa Thompson for her performance aloneshe steals the show. White people may feel uncomfortable with many of her characters' diatribes but considering that black people have been the subject of humiliating put-downs from whites, since the time of slavery, it's understandable that that a reaction formation would be in order: to maintain self-esteem and the upper hand in conversation, a vocabulary designed to facilitate a 'comeuppance' toward whites, appears predictable amongst many black people. On the other hand, assigning collective responsibility (particularly due to the "sins of the fathers"), is a strategy that might be self-satisfying but self-destructive at the same time.

Mr. Simien has written a clever script with many great lines. Nonetheless, in the future, he needs to pay more attention to developing his characters a bit more, along with upping the stakes, when it comes to the plot.

After hearing praise about this movie, especially along the lines of being a good "black" movie, I decided to watch it in the end. To make it short: the movie disappoints.

So the overall story seems to be the lead-up to a "black face party" hosted by a - predominantly white - organizer group that organizes parties annually with varying themes, but could not think of one for now. It is a story full of intrigue, with the main characters being the gay black write with a white core (from the TV Series "Everyone hates Chris"), the ambitious colored son, smoking crack and with a white, whiny girlfriend, of the equally colored dean, a black-panther-like girl that is academically failing apparently and trying to cover this all with (a) becoming house president of the predominantly black house and (b) publicly protesting against measure that would allow white people to join said house - which, in essence, is racism as well.

Now, the story sounds complicated enough, and would be interesting on its own. Unfortunately, the movie does not deliver. Much of the time, the movie is overly draggy and boring to watch; I struggled to get through the whole movie. The story moves along at a snail's pace sometimes (or seems to), and much of the situational humor falls flat.

tl;dr do not watch.

I thought that the movie started off being very humorous then slowly became more and more serious as it went on; heading towards the finish line it felt to me almost like a documentary on race and the consequences of racism and its inevitable reaction.

The acting was generally very good, as were the production values and the story idea. I have watched Black-ish and am not sure if it is my imagination or not, but there seems to be a rise of race motivated comedy and satire: towards the end of the Obama-era and heading into Trump-time.

As a Limey, I found the film hard to follow at points, due the large amount of American cultural references.

I would say that it would not be everyone's' cup of tea and probably doesn't translate too well outside of the USA; but apart from that most American adults would probably find the film worth having a look at.

Justin Simien's directorial debut should be lauded for its ambition, but as both a director and screenwriter, he has a long ways to go. An attractive cast of varying ability is saddled with an overstuffed script that has unnecessary subplots and diversions (while still having a convenient economy of characters), leaving a movie that lurches around from plot point to plot point, with some areas of that plot being underdeveloped and unconvincing.

Meanwhile, Simien the director is all over clever visuals and storytelling devices, yet he has a hard time dealing with various tones of the movie. More importantly, the pace of the film is leaden, which sucks the life out of some of the potentially humorous situations, while making some of the social commentary come off as more strident than need be. A lot of scenes feature awkward staging, with some actors seeming to not know what to do as a scene winds down.

The result is a movie with more than its fair share of nice moments and some winning performances, with almost no cohesion whatsoever. This is a shame, as Simien makes some good points throughout the movie on the state of race relations in America.

Roger Ebert noted that it's not necessarily what a movie is about, but how it is about it. The high praise for this movie represents the flip side of this notion, as it's getting plaudits for what it's about rather than its execution.

I am glad that this film addresses the important issue of racism on college campuses, and I have no disagreement with its political or social justice messages. Any sincere attempt by a filmmaker to make these experiences visible to the broader public is a good thing.

As a white educator who actually attended and later taught at top- tier colleges, I had been looking forward to experiencing a new sharp creative critique of American racism on college campuses as promised by the film's trailer.

This film utterly failed in its attempts to entertain or provoke. It did not provide me even with the typical pleasures of cinema, let alone fresh insight into its subject. It was little more than a leaden slow-moving soap opera with a contrived plot, oddly dressed characters and unconvincing dialogue. In my experience of elite campuses, it is the rare Ivy student (of any race) who routinely dresses like a junior business executive and uses this sort of pretentious speech pattern. Watching this film was like watching a Western in which all the characters had British accents and wore kimonos.

For readers who seek moving and insightful films on racism, I highly recommend Spike Lee "joints" which provide viewers with superior entertainment, dialogue, characters, plot, provocation and insight.

The acting was well done, as was the location, the lighting, the camera work, etc. etc. Even the dialogue worked very well. The subject matter, however, and its treatment made the movie a well-done waste of time.

What matters in today's economy is getting and keeping decent jobs. What the movie shows, however, is overly-privileged students who are more concerned with manufacturing racial hatred than with studying courses and gaining skills that employers want. It is as if Simien, the writer and director, has no experience with life outside his liberal-elite world. Black American culture is one of many shared experiences in America, and there is nothing particularly special or praise-worthy about it, but Simien seems unable to put his racial blinders aside. For goodness sake, we have Jews, Asians (many kinds!), whites, Latinos, Eastern Europeans, etc. -- we're all in it together. This white/black divide was already old a generation ago. If Simien wants to be relevant as a film-maker who appeals beyond his inbred elitist audience, he needs to open the curtains and let in some light.

I was first exposed to Dear White People by its trailer. The trailer was so promising it put the movie to a much higher level of expectation than it actually is so it could have only been a slight disappoint. The film is smart, punchy, and funny, for a film about racism and racial tensions.

The preppy college setting screams for an amazing story about racial tensions and racism. The black characters that the film follows - Coco the girl who wants to be white, Lionel the awkward gay guy that doesn't quite fit in, Troy who fits in but isn't quite himself, and the infamous Sam who is basically a modern day activist with a secret boyfriend - are actually good archetypes of nowadays college educated black people because they are all unique if not for the color of their skin.

With this basis Simien delivered an interesting film about racial tensions between blacks and whites without shaming or blaming one of the two parties involved. But the film sort of feels like a fluff piece that didn't really dive deep into the subject. The white characters are mostly stereotypical, they are the same to be honest, arrogant, and entitled. The film quickly becomes more about about finding one's identity and western society in general than racial tensions. Maybe, that's the point, one of the message behind it is that racial tensions stems from the way our society is, with whites liking the black cultures but not its people? I don't really know but at least Dear White People is a good conversation starter. 

As for the actors, I mean the ones with layers to their characters, they gave a stellar performance. Tessa Thompson portrayed a riveting Sam with talent, wit and insolence. And Tyler James Williams was probably the easiest character to relate to, he likes what he likes and doesn't try to change who he is.

For a first film Dear White People is interesting and if the trailer hadn't been so good I probably would have been in awe after watching it. @wornoutspines

The first 20min was OK... I thought it was going to be funny. Then it gets laughably silly, campy and pretentious. The actors are caricatures of real people. At first you think in the next scene you'll suddenly find more depth and things will come into focus, but no... In the end it's got this sad "Stick to your own people, stop trying to pretend to be white/black if you're not" message which really makes me feel sad for whomever wrote this. What a dark little world they live in. The bits about colleges throwing black-face parties all the time are even a bit ridiculous. The movies based in some fictional ivy league school, but the examples they give are all of tiny colleges no-ones ever heard of. I'm not saying there isn't a race problem in this country, there is for sure. But what this movie is portraying is wildly exaggerated. This is the kind of movie the real racists watch and say "That doesn't happen! It's all made up!" and they're right.

I watched,with great pain,the pitifully biased and nonsensical film that attempted to elevate the discourse on real racism and its presence in our world. Well funded and full of passion,it simply shows whites as the worst people,ever. The black people in the film,ironically,came off just one half a notch less awful. Im a glass half full type,so I have more optimism than the cynic that penned this thing,but the answer to this problem is NOT to write a film that portrays whites as whiskey drinking KKK types with greasy hair and hate in their hearts. The only answer is truth. Pursue it. This is NOT the truth. Just a slant.

There's not much to say, honestly, the stereotypes, the racism, the bigotry, all run rampant. There's a line where satire crosses into racism, and this film crosses that line to the point of uncomfortable spitefulness. I understand why the film was done and what the overlying plot of the film is. The director here is aiming for us to feel sorry for black culture as well as to understand the plight of what the race is going through, but the director fails to realize the most important things, there are no reputable characters in this whole wobbled premise, and everyone within the film, minus the writer, is someone you can actually care for. This film, putting it lightly, is positively excrement in it's purest form. Taking a shot at our institutions of higher learning and labeling it as "satire" is both irresponsible and negligent, and if people honestly believe in what this director has put on screen, with a series to follow on Netflix, full of the same plot lines, it's no wonder why there are so many riots and protests. The public will buy into anything if you put enough hate into it.

The most intriguing aspect of this film is not the film itself but the public's reaction to it. From multiple message boards I saw questions like if this is racist, a new Do the Right Thing, or if this film is even needed. From there it is clear that this film is doing something right. A great film does not try to make you agree with the issue but it raises the correct questions. It does not matter the answer the viewers got from the film as long as the viewers are asking the questions. After this film I too asked a lot of questions about race, and not about black cultures but of all different ones. 

The film does a really good job of balancing the four main characters, and while sometimes the characters seem more stereotypical, there are also couple of quirky aspect there as well that balances it out. Tessa Thompson as Sam White is the centrepiece of the movie, and she excels in her job as she does not overshadow the other characters but often compliments them. Lionel Higgins played by Tyler James Williams plays a very lovable character that faces not one, but two different prejudices. However in the film his skin colour dominates his sexual orientation making this feel more like a gimmick than a fully realized character sketch. Kyle Gallner as Kurt Fletcher and Teyonah Parris as Coco Conners rounds off the main characters and they too felt authentic in their role. Kurt's subplot with his father was very real but Coco's problem about wanting to be white felt so superficial. 

There is a lot of quirky shots as well, and for the first ten minutes I was hooked by it's use of documentary style shots of the various campuses throughout the school. Unfortunately the unique style dissipates after a while, and the film whilst beautiful filled with unique shots never goes back to the quirky, almost meta style it had before. I wish that the level of ingenuity remained throughout the movie. 

Overall the movie is fun and has different styles to keep you entertained and in the end you will want to ask all the right questions while leaving with very different answers.

It's a Satirical Comedy. 

Some people may be offended by the candid nature of the material. I think the writers and cast handled the subject matter in a very mature fashion. 

I was initially jarred, yes. But then I kept watching. I noticed I have had a few shared experiences and feelings regarding some of the things depicted. 

Great cast who carry the material with the grace and care it deserves. 

Definitely a conversation starter. Relationship end-er depending on the crowd.

Some thoughts: 

(1) The filmmakers do far too much hiding of their own opinions in the various opinions presented here. 

(2) I bet however, that they do believe things like "black people can't be racist". Exposing the ever-self-serving corresponding absurdity, being as simple as looking up the word "racist" in the damn dictionary. Instead of putting up a highly-specialized/strawman definition, only to pretend that it's THE definition. 

(3) There are actual slaves in the world. Right now. Millions of them. Moreover, even in the US, there is both very real slavery and very real racism. Not dumb college kids responding to faux-civil-rights-crusader bait and wearing some dumb costumes at some dumb private party. No. People are actually being forced away from their health and freedom based on race and class - in the US - as we speak. Black people, brown people, Asian people, even white people (see: Eastern European sex trafficking), etc. Exceedingly few of these grim realities, have very much to do at all - with what's depicted here. And if one is really concerned about such matters - one would find a way to reflect (at least SOME of) them in one's film. If however, one is selfishly concerned instead with the minutiae of one's own exceedingly-privileged (by world and even US standards) existence, while wanting to disguise oneself as a hard-issue-tackler - one would make a film just like this. 

(4) And if burying one's head this far up one's own rectum is an absolute must - I'd at least ask that there's a clear corresponding point. Which brings us back to (1) above.

(5) Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but when people pretend to care about higher ideals, while their efforts are all too obviously aimed instead at merely serving themselves - I have trouble seeing anything else. Whether it's Fox News with their constant cry-bullying. Or what madness Nazi atrocities and such have been used to justify in the middle East. Or such, admittedly-milder, yet all-too-similar cases.
