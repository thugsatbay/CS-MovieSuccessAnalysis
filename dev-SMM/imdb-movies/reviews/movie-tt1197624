### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This is a great idea. A technical genius who is somehow able to commit revenge murders from his jail cell. He doesn't hide the fact he's a killer; in fact he announces each murder just before it happens.

Technically everything was possible and the method very cleverly hidden so I was kept in suspense until the last 20 minutes when the cat was let out of the bag too early. The ending is a let down. It's true Hollywood: Technically improbable, illogical, and in my opinion it spoils all the character development made until that point and wastes the opportunity for a much darker ending with a more satisfying outcome.

All that said I really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone not disturbed by moderate violence. Go see it!

I didn't have high expectations for this movie and only went because my friend made me. That being said I loved it. I actually wanted to applaud and cheer at one point and I never do that. Clyde now ranks as on of my favorite characters ever. Now for the bad part. Jamie Foxx was horrible!!!!!!! I don't understand why directors and casting directors like to put bad actors against good actors. It seems to be an ever increasing trend in Hollywood. we saw it in "the Italian job" and we see it here. Jamie's acting was the worst I had seen in a long time. He showed no emotion at all. I would have liked to see a better actor cast but hey who am I? Also, listen up producers, the ending was ridiculous!!!! I mean come on. you build this character up only for a huge let down. That was by far one of the most irresponsible endings to a movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. When I tell people to see this I am recommending that they leave at a specific point about 15min before it's over and imagine your own ending because no matter what it will be better. Endings like that is the reason people watch independent films. This movie could have been an all time classic but for Jamie Foxx and the writer's lazy ending. It still may because I loved most of it. I pray someday producers figure out that we want something a little different and allow things to end the right way, the responsible way for their viewers.

Thank you,

The movie was not unlike other movies where you see the good guy go rogue after rough handling by "the system". But I really liked the development of the characters in the beginning, and I am sure I am not the only one out there hoping that the "Law Abiding Citizen" would be able to pull it off.

Then came the middle where plot points become strained, where we have to take a few leaps of faith and leave the world of genius for one of Hollywood. OK, I'm still there, taking the ride with you.

But then we get to the ending which destroys the film and makes it into brain pablum; mental oatmeal that anyone can digest but no one can get any flavor from. Mr. Genius buys several industrial areas -- but why? Only 2 seemed to be necessary for the plot. And why would Panama know the purchase prices? And down to the cent! Corporations don't need to share that information with foreign governments. Nix that link and this movie would have been more interesting. We're expected to believe a genius would leave the cleaning cart in obvious view in the hallway and right next to the area where he put the bomb? We're expected to believe the genius wouldn't have trapped his escape route. And we're expected to believe they transferred this bomb from Point A to Point B without setting it off and in record time, all while Foxx waits in the cell, and Scotty Junior brings up the rear, unseen and unheard.

I wanted Foxx's arrogant character to lose his daughter, to feel what this man went through, and then I wanted him to get away with it.

Anyone agree?

LOL so I went to this movie expecting 2-ish hours of non-stop righteous anger and awesomeness a la "Taken"... the movie built up pretty well with some flaws (why does he need to mysteriously need to escape from the cell and be his own accomplice?). And ended in probably the worst way I could possibly imagine. If I wanted to come up with the ultimate Hollywood BS ending, I could not have thought of what they pulled out of their *** myself. At some point the movie makes the conversion where Gerard Butler goes from good guy to bad, and Jamie Fox becomes the good guy... I definitely did not follow. Why would I want to see a movie where the morally bankrupt lawyer wins!? LOL that's so terrible it's worse than laughable; it's worth about 5 mins of laughing and 15 mins of ranting outside the theater after the movie ends (which I did btw). In a situation where the protagonists' wife and 10-year old daughter are raped and murdered, the entire system deserves to be brought down. If I go to a movie where the system screws over the little guy and that little guy comes back to dish out real justice, I absolutely, positively DO NOT want to see the "system" win in the end, regardless of any Hollywood-ed glossed over change of heart the corrupt lawyer might happen to have. I'd give it about an 8.5-9.0 until the last 15 minutes where it rapidly plummets to a 1.0 at best. Worst. Ending. Ever.

OK so the premise of the ending is that, although the justice system is flawed, you cant just kill people to get your own justice and you are becoming what you hate and it will lead to your demise. So how does the director explain then that Foxx, the supposed good guy of the film, instead of using the justice system he represents to hold Butler accountable for his crimes, does instead just murder him in his cell. How does that make him any different to Butler. But Foxx murdering someone is apparently OK and he goes on to have a happy life watching his daughter play the cello. Murdering someone because they are murdering because of the murder of other people. Irony anyone.

Its a real shame but the stupidity and lack of bravery in giving the film the ending it deserved just ruined it.

This is a movie that's extremely fun to watch in the theaters because you get to hear and see everyone's reaction to each of his killings. The best one had people actually saying loudly "wow" and "oh my god!".

What drew me to the movie was the fact that the hero wasn't going around killing people with his bare hands or face to face. He was doing it with his mind, with careful planning, and deft precision. That was something refreshing to see. I can totally relate to his feelings of anger over the flaws in the justice system and his desire to take matters into his own hands - to make things right.

The ending was disappointing but the rest of the film was not and I liked it overall.

Just watched LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. I don't know why i still bother watching American movies. It's a decade-long Hollywood tradition to screw up good ideas by illogical plots and happy endings. The WHOLE point of the movie, bringing DOWN the legal system could only be proved if Shelton was to walk free after all he did. To show that the legal system was unable to hinder him murdering people though being in custody AND had to set him free, because the DA and the judge broke the law to stop his series of murder thus ignoring his civil rights which would ultimately lead to dismissing all charges. The supposed plot to blow up the mayor and homeland security does not at all fit neither the character of Shelton nor the plot of the movie. Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes. Hollywoods Epitaph.

...This movie would be a real treat...

I enjoy'd this movie really much and i must say that i find my self wondering - why this good movie had to end so badly. The characters are good and there is no question why... Jamie is good and no need to say that Gerard is one of the best "new" actors in "the market". Also the story is good and even better is the story telling, but this is only my opinion.

The best that i can say is: if you have seen "Taking of Pelham123" and liked that movie, then you will also like this one. And both of these movies have two things in common, they both were good movies, with bad endings...

I don't want to be critical and also don't want to say much good things about this movie, because this one of these movies what go to the department of "have to see it my self" And I'm about 75% sure that you will enjoy this movie. But once again, what a shame about the ending...

It was one of the better movies i have seen in last six months, and i still got to repeat that the ENDING was awful. Great actors, great story, and why always justice prevail, my question is: What do you rather watch, be honest, the bad guy who wins the American justice, or the other ending?! I think the first choice is the right answer, i am certain that all of you think the same.

This movie really takes the cake. It's focused on a father (Clyde) who gets beaten and his wife and daughter are killed by 2 crooks. However the crooks' punishment was dimmed down because of a deal made by the lawyers(Jamie Fox). 10 years later, Clyde decides to take out the entire corrupt justice system.

This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the main character Clyde really makes this movie something memorable and just extraordinary. You can compare Clyde to the Joker pretty much, but in my opinion 10 times better. Clyde devises sneaky and cunning ways by taking down his victims and the whole sense on whether he is the hero or villain also adds to the excitement. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer.

There are a few scenes that will guaranteed make you laugh and a few scenes that will pretty much tell you that Clyde is just one kickbutt character, no questions about it. Every scene you will be wondering what will happen next, because you honestly won't know. The movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes 2 very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie. Law Abiding Citizen will not disappoint.

A solid movie. It was not predictable. The actors were great in their roles except for a sub-par Leslie Bibb (TV actress with waning looks). After the first five minutes I thought I made my assumptions of what was going to happen but I was totally wrong.

Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx work perfect against each other. There are a few lulls in the movie towards the end but overall it was a real good movie.

Perhaps the message of this movie can somehow persuade real change in our legal practices. It is worth seeing. The way the film is shot and the sound effects make this an intense movie.

Come on Hollywood, this guy was so clever, tactful & brilliant & yet you expect the audience to believer that he wouldn't even have a bloody security system installed on the very building, which was the only means of exit & entry to his prison cell... never mind that the building housed nerve & command center, from which he executed his flavour of justice!

Here's another plot hole of gargantuan proportion(s); how in the heck did Fox get the briefcase/bomb back to the jail cell BEFORE Butler returned? Oh yeah & WHY would Fox willfully allow Butler to detonate the bomb, even though he had discovered the means, by which he was perpetrating his reign of terror?!? That would be the epitome of anti-justice- especially considering he was the acting D.A.! Why didn't they show him being charged & prosecuted for murder?!?

This is a case whereby you actually wanted the bad guy to get the last word in on the matter!!! But no... Jamie Fox had to come out on top! Actually, I think Fox would/should have been the FIRST person on Butler's list! WHY couldn't Hollywood just grant this movie the ending it righteously deserved?!? It was going sooo well! Whoever is in charge of the ending to this film ought to have been on Butler's list!

Clyde Shelton's ( Gerard Butler ) wife gets murdered in the beginning of the movie and justice doesn't prevail because one of the killers is only sentenced for 10 years. Clyde is angry as hell and will make sure the people responsible for the horrible trial of the killers will all suffer and die. So basically you got yourself a revenge movie here. Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on. Now the fun part is that Clyde is performing the kills from within his prison cell, he even has to sit out in solitary and is still killing people, now how cool is that.

I totally dig the idea of a highly intelligent man orchestrating kills on specific times and places from his prison cell, all planned ahead of time. If you're a smart ass while watching this movie you'll find out there are a lot of plot holes so I recommend you not to think it all through. Heads up for Gerard Butler, this guy is making some mayor progress on this one after some sh!tty movies last year. I think we'll be seeing more of King Leonidas in the future so hurray to that. On the opposite, Jamie Foxx is on a decline. Ray was an excellent movie but after that it's just bad. As Nick Rice the DA he is just one stone face mofo, no emotion no nothing. Jamie and the ending of the movie are the only 2 things that suck. The movie is just handing out it's surprises like candy, like spoiling your daughter's birthday present a week before her actual birthday. Watch it with a time progress bar and stop the movie before the last 15 minutes, then close your eyes and make up your own ending and I promise you it will be way better then the awful piece of movie you just skipped...

What a terrible cop-out - coulda been excellent! This film begins with a great moral ideal of exposing and pulling down a corrupt justice system by a calculating husband whose family were brutally raped and murdered in front of him 10 years earlier, the rapist/killer walking free 3 years after the prosecutor made a deal for testimony against his partner-in-crime. Unfortunately, after a successful killing spree against numerous members of the justice department from within his jail cell in solitary confinement, the star of the show, who is smart enough to arrange all of this, is somehow clumsy enough to allow his methods, nightly exit route from prison and piece de resistance (napalm bomb) to be discovered, leading to an about face by the chief prosecutor (now DA) who suddenly goes from object of hatred to vilified victim/come star as the previous randomly dumped star of the show napalms himself by accident. What a shame, what a confusing and ridiculous ending. To me, this film was like a dark and violent Shawshank Redemption that ended about half an hour too early when the writer had a brain transplant and the production team ran out of money and ideas. Random and just wrong, and like I said,a real shame.

This movie was fabulous until the last 10 minutes. it was full of action and real characters. The characters had flaws. Through the entire movie Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) was not a character that I liked or sided with, while Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) was human and easy to empathize with. Although the entire movie required suspension of disbelief, the ending was unfulfilling and implausible given the rest of the movie. It was as if the villain was actually Rice with his corruptness, while Shelton was indeed a law-abiding citizen driven to vengeance by the corruptness of Rice and the justice system. The real disjustice was the ending of this movie. I kept expecting the intelligence shown by Shelton throughout the movie to come to a head in the ending. I was highly disappointed by the anti-climatic ending. Stop the movie about 10 before the end and create your own ending; it will be better than what was on-screen.

"A Serious Man" was sold out, so I needed to waste two hours before the next showing with another movie. I picked this one. Big mistake. It is about a genius government assassin who gets revenge on a corrupt justice system with the aid of a machine gun, an exploding cell phone and blowfish venom. We do not get much insight into his character, because most of the movie's dialogue consists of variations on the phrase "This is f**ked up." Along the way, a series of strange riddles are raised: 1) Why does the CIA assassin live in a neighborhood where junkies are liable to break into his home and kill his family? Wouldn't his pay grade allow him a home with less riffraff and better security? 2) Why would a CIA assassin be surprised at the fact that the justice system is flawed? 3) Why does the Philadelphia city government keep scheduling meetings to figure out how the assassin is committing murder from his prison cell, yet it never occurs to anyone to maybe install a camera or a guard to see what he's doing in there all day? 3) Couldn't the city at least transfer him to a higher-security prison after he confesses to killing about 12 people? 4) Why do the two lawyers go investigate the Batcave BY THEMSELVES when they can't even get through a full workday without a colleague being killed by an exploding object? 4) How can a bomb under a bed incinerate everything but the bed? 

I think the answer to these riddles is, "Because the movie is retarded," but they still left me feeling upset and confused. It is worth noting that at one point in the movie, certain events are recorded to a DVD seen by the lawyer character's daughter, and the lawyer describes the DVD as "a dumb horror movie that she shouldn't be watching." That sums it up. Even the characters in the movie thought the movie was dumb. 2/10.

Great movie for about 80% of the time ... great acting, great story line, great film-making ... thoroughly enjoyable... BUT... the end is atrocious! I'm sorry, but the end to this completely ruined it for me, and as such, wished I hadn't watched it. If it had followed in the footsteps of "The Usual Suspects" (AWESOME movie) this film could have ranked a 10. Any father, any husband, any "law abiding citizen" would agree. Don't want to ruin it for future watches - but there you are. As I said, the film-making is great, the acting is great, but why does Hollywood insist that the good guy always wins? So sad, that such a potentially excellent script was destroyed by "the good guy!".

This film is gory, but the gore is mostly suggested rather than shown. You can make up your own mind as to how gory you want it to be. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) are excellent as "frenemies." They still sympathize with each other, in a way, as each teaches the other a lesson. Butler is excellent as the crushed father and husband who believes he must use his unique skills and talent to make an example of a justice system that has forgotten the victims. You sympathize with him even as he enacts his vicious lesson plan upon Foxx's coworkers. Foxx is an arrogant self-serving assistant district attorney who is only concerned with his conviction rate as he claws his way up the ladder in the justice system. He has forgotten the victims. But when he has a family of his own, he begins to see Clyde's point, yet he cannot give in to all of Clyde's demands to stop the carnage. Beautifully films in a noir tone with excellent timing on the stunts and effects. Law Abiding Citizen is an adrenaline-pumping experience. Bring your heart meds.

In Philadelphia, the family man Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is violently attacked at home by two punks and his wife and daughter are rapped and murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte). The two criminals are arrested by the police but the ambitious D.A. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) makes a deal with the assassin Darby that accuses his partner to keep his average of convictions in court despite the protest of Clyde. Ten years later, Darby's partner is executed by lethal injection but the defective machine makes him suffer lots of pain. Meanwhile Clyde abducts Darby and executes him in a sadistic way. Clyde is arrested without evidences and Nick negotiates his confession. Sooner Nick discovers that the purpose of Clyde is not only vengeance, but to destroy the corrupt justice system and the head of the city that released the assassin of his family. 

Since I saw the trailer of "Law Abiding Citizen", I have been anxious to see this film. Last week, it was released on DVD in Brazil by Swen Filmes and after watching it, unfortunately I found it a blockbuster movie with a promising beginning and a disappointing conclusion. The plot works well showing the deception of an apparently common citizen with the way the corrupt justice system works. Then there is the first inconsistency: why should a man with his background wait for ten years to catch a criminal that had been released seven years ago? Why should he be in jail to destroy the justice system and the City Hall? Last but not the least, why didn't he kill the wife and daughter of Nick Rice to make him feel the same sort of pain and grief that he had been submitted with his decision? That would be the most appropriate revenge for an intelligent man after killing the murderers of his family, but probably the producers were more interested in the box office than in a reasonably more believable non-commercial plot. Only people that do not think might find this movie amazing as I glanced in some reviews. The exaggeration and accuracy of his plans are also annoying and absolutely unbelievable, and the arrogant character performed by Jamie Foxx is despicable to win in the end. My vote is six.

And this ending was disappointing to say the least. At what point of the film were we supposed to start liking Jamie Foxx's character. We spend the first hour hating that guy and he gets the last laugh, it makes no sense. If they are going to kill off Gerard Butler's character, I think the Jamie Foxx character should have died too! When did revenge become such a dirty word. It's a shame there isn't a film where Jamie Foxx isn't the hero.... It will be the last time I see a film with his name anywhere near the credits.

For crying out loud, he let a child rapist off the hook to further his career, and then they make him the hero in the end. And Gerard Butler's character is supposed to be a super genius that outsmarts the most wanted terrorists, only to get outsmarted by a a spoiled rich lawyer who neglects his family. It's like some amazing writer wrote the plot and then some jerk director comes in and changes the ending. Why can't Hollywood just give me a good ending to a movie.

This reminds me of the start of a great relationship, starts out wonderful, continues to grow, and then out of nowhere, BAM, it ends and you are left wondering what just happened.

As so many other reviewers have stated, it starts out with great suspense, originality, and creativity, and somewhere in the last 20 minutes, you are left wondering, did it really just end that way? Ouch! I found myself incredibly disappointed.

We all love Jaime Foxx's funny side, but really wanted to see something else happen to him in this film. I get the idea of the end, that he learned his lesson so to speak, but it was still really weak for what it could have been.

However, I'll still give it an 8 as it kept me quite intrigued throughout...so hard to find these days in a quality film.

Why, oh why can't we see just one movie come out of the American Stables where the "bad guy" (who isn't really bad) wins? This film, as others have said so many times, is great until the last 15 minutes but then the whole automatic "but you can't take the law into your own hands" moral bull kicks in. I'd like to see just one director have the guts to show that sometimes the law has to be broken for justice to be done because the legal system can be corrupted. This film DID show that the system sometimes doesn't work. It illustrated that very well but it still followed the same path of countless others like it and veered away from the real justice towards the pseudo-moralistic tired old message; the Law is the Law. Sad.

Law Abiding Citizen, in a way, is a movie that became too big for it's own good. The Gerard Butler character was a mastermind. He was so intelligent that no one could figure out how he was doing the things he was doing. So crafty, that no matter what safety precautions were taken, people were still dying. The problem, though, became very apparent as Citizen was nearing the last half hour. How do you explain it all. It's almost as if 3/4 of this movie was made, and then the makers remembered that they had to end this thing. And so they did. Only what we were given, the resolution to it all, was so anticlimactic (and for that matter, unbelievable) that it was almost laughable. I think it would have been better to leave it a mystery then to give the audience what was one of the most outlandish conclusions to a film I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that what came before this was a masterpiece. The dialogue was, at times decent, and at other times sub-par. The characters were never developed enough for people to really care about what happened to them, and the editing left something to be desired. But even with all of that I was still interested. I still wanted to see where all of this was going, and how all of this was happening. I shouldn't have been so eager. They say that sometimes, the unknown is much more intriguing than the known. I guess the makers of this film should have kept that in mind.

I guess every actor sooner or later finds himself in the position that Denzel Washington found himself in with "Fallen" and "Law Abiding Citizen" is certainly Jamie Foxx's low point. I was looking forward to this because I thought it was going to be a drama about an "every day guy" (as advertised) taking the law into his own hands after his family is brutally murdered, but instead it turned out to be about an unbelievable super spook somehow wreaking vengeance on all the wrong people in a truly ridiculous, boring and uninspired tale of misguided revenge. Gerard Butler's interpretation of Anthopny Hopkins in Fracture or Kevin Spacey in Seven only kept the momentum going for a little while until the completely absurd plot took over. This is one of those movies where you are expected to suspend your disbelief indefinitely but unfortunately, the nagging question lingers that if this guy is able to concoct and exact such elaborate plots from a solitary confinement prison cell, then why couldn't he defend his own wife and child in his own home to begin with. Silly, stupid, and a waste of time. Let's hope Jamie Foxx holds out for something better next time.
