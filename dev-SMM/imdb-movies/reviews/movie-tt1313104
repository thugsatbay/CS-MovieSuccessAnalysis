One-sided? Yes. Superbly crafted? Most certainly. A practical joke or fantastically manufactured lie? Despite what many of the conspiracy theorists here would tell you, no, it is not.

The campaigning elements of the film may not sit well with some people, but the facts are the facts, and there's simply no denying the emotional impact this film has. It is a prime example of constructed film-making with an overt agenda, filled with elements that at time make it feel like a heist movie or spy thriller.

Having said that, there's no doubting just how real the horrors are. The annual slaughter of thousands of dolphins in an isolated cove near Taiji is sickening, heart-wrenching and unnecessary. After select dolphins are taken for the world's aquariums, the rest are left for brutal and barbaric butchering. I for one appreciate the risks taken by the film makers in attempting to get this story out, and I would place good money on this documentary being a front-runner for next year's Oscars.

One of the marks of a powerful documentary is the response it generates from the hordes of nay Sayers. Some of the absurdly laughable comments listed here on IMDb are begging to be called out and exposed for the pathetic lies that they are.

Conspiracy theory/lie no.1: The premise of dolphins being slaughtered en masse in Taiji is a complete fabrication.

This belongs in the same volume of crackpot collections as those who deny the dangers of global warming. It is indeed real, and there is a plethora of information available to anyone with 3rd grade research skills. An article by Minoru Matsutani appeared in the Japan Times on Sept 23rd this year covering the issues raised in The Cove. The practice of mass dolphin slaying is indeed confirmed.

Falsehood no.2: That the scenes from Taiji's infamous cove were in fact filmed in Ottawa.

People will fabricate lies without any thought of at least giving the lie some credibility. There is no evidence to support this ridiculous claim. And having personally travelled along the east coast of Honshu in 2001, I can tell you that this is indeed filmed in Taiji.

Falsehood no.3: Dolphins are not native to Japan.

Wrong. Dead wrong. Bottlenose dolphins, for one, inhabit all warm temperate seas worldwide  including Japan. In fact, Mikura Island has a permanent colony of bottlenose dolphins.

I'm utterly delighted that this film is stirring up so much emotion, as this is exactly what is needed to spark change. Most people in Japan aren't even aware of this atrocity, and had it not been for this film, I seriously doubt many of them would have ever known.

Something tells me that this heartbreaking documentary is going to stay with me for a long, long time. This movie depicts in painful detail the horrors of dolphin fishing (yes, you heard me right) which has been occurring for a long time in a secretive place called Taiji in Japan. How secretive? Even the common Japanese do not know that it is taking place in their country. The film takes its time in unfolding the horrors and conspiracy layer by layer and ends with a bang. It plays out like a suspense thriller but is far more effective than any suspense thrillers because this takes place in real life. I certainly will do my best to promote it to the others and support the cause. The direction is fantastic and several underwater shots seem to be taken right off Earth or National Geographic, which looks great on the big screen. This documentary has been made by activists that have been crying out loud to deaf ears for the past three decades. I am certain that this is not the last we will hear of it. This film should certainly make an impact and change a few things in the world.

Enough has been said about this excellent documentary, but I wanted to comment on the negative responses, some of which are posted here and which also can be read on the message board. If you have not seen this movie, DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION to the moronic comments, view this film and judge for yourself. If you are an intelligent, caring person, concerned about the environment and the animals, you must see this documentary. The film was made with great risks involved and all who took part in making it have to be commended for their courage and desire to show the truth. I saw the film several days ago and I cannot get it out of my head. It is the most disturbing film I have seen since "The Witness" (not to be confused with the one starring Harrison Ford). When I saw the movie, the theatre was practically empty, and that was disappointing because people should be made aware of the horrors documented in this film.

It saddens me to watch The Cove, because unless your heart is made of stone, it's unlikely not to become unaffected by it, when it shows how evil man can be. It also boggles the mind when you mull over whether the perpetrators know exactly what they're doing in committing such atrocities, that extinction of species boil down to those who are indifferent, inhumane, and corrupted by the smell of profits that highlights Man's propensity for destruction. To claim superiority over another by explanation of the preservation of culture, is bullshit at best, and it just shows how consciously ignorant we can sometimes get due to either lack of understanding, or just simply refusing to change incorrect mindsets.

I'm sure many of us will agree that dolphins are very beautiful water-based mammals, and the lucky few who have gotten to chance upon them in their natural habitat will attest to the fact that it's awe-inspiring to have seen them in action. From time to time we read about the heroic nature of our mammal counterparts in saving human lives, so what would warrant such untold cruelties toward those blessed by Nature with a smile and an extremely gentle, docile nature, or cursed as the filmmakers would say, because they are unable to project outwardly their feelings of pain, sadness and betrayal by humankind?

Director Louie Psihoyos had crafted an incredible documentary which isn't just another save- this-species film, or just another wildlife conservation flick. Somehow, The Cove stands above those that I've seen which have run along those lines, in that it contains footages that the team had managed to wrangle out in a quest for the truth. It contains scenes of murder most foul, which will start again in the month of September, unless people around the world make some noise beyond puppet worldwide organizations fueled by corrupt bureaucrats bent on smug thinking that half-baked nonsensical answers can keep the truth under wraps.

What also added that emotional weight to the film, is the inclusion of Richard O'Barry, who could be infamously credited with sparking the interest in dolphin-aquariums and shows around the world, simply because of his involvement in the Flipper television series, where he had responsibility in capturing and training 5 dolphins used for that successful series, and henceforth spawned an industry of sorts where dolphins are captured en masse by confusing them and leading them into man-made traps, then allowing trainers around the world to come and choose those with potential. Think of it like the slave trade which we have abhorred, but now transferred to the animal kingdom, with a murderous act of slaughtering thousands of those which don't make the theme-park cut. Who are we to decide those that cannot entertain, only deserves to be chopped up in cold blood for the supermarkets?

O'Barry is now an activist set on releasing every dolphin in captivity, but only because of a personal, profound loss of a dolphin in his arms that have jolted him into action. He's quite forthright in his interviews, and his transformation as explained is nothing less than heart- wrenching. His crusade led him to Taiji, Japan, which is the source of the trade, with over- zealous Japanese fishermen bordering on counter-surveillance, muscling in on local police influence, to try and keep O'Barry at bay from interrupting their profitable trade, and of course putting a dampener on O'Barry's search for redemption.

Most of the film then centered on the filmmakers and their assembling of a few good men and women with specific skill sets, such as free-diving and prop-making, acoustics experts to covert camera operations, in an attempt to expose the truth from The Cove, an area designed by natural geography and exploited by the fishermen to perform their most heinous acts. It's akin to a heist movie with intense preparation work and danger lurking around every corner, but the images obtained are nothing less than shocking  the indiscriminate slaughter without remorse and plenty of laughter, a very affecting sea waters filled with red from the bloodbath, and frenetic cries for help and unsuccessful flight from death. It'll make the most stoic of men, shed tears.

The film also had touched upon another aspect of how Man is offending Nature through our polluting ways, but Psihoyos deftly included that portion in because it's also related, but never letting it detract its focus from the main story. While dolphin meat doesn't appeal, being slyly packaged as something else is nothing less than cheating. Also, the high levels of mercury found in the meat not only endangers whoever is putting it on their dinner plate, but just emphasizes the entire polluted food chain with the fact that we are the #1 pollutants on this planet, and poisoning of marine life, or rapid consumption of food from the sea, is something that will impact us in time to come very soon, unless we wake up.

One of the world's most intelligent creatures getting slaughtered indiscriminately, and you can do something about it. Undoubtedly as a film this is very well made, and have received countless of accolades, but if audiences were to stop at this point then nothing will change and everything will be lost, starting from the efforts from the activists. This film is set to break into my top films of the year as well, but even that rings hollow.

What we can do, at the very least, is to vote with our wallet. Make some noise, talk about it, spread the word and get people go watch the film, and take affirmative action. With demand and attendances to sea-world-like or dolphin theme parks come crashing down because we choose not to patronize them, then demand for dolphins to perform at these locations will no longer be viable.

I believe it is a disgrace for culture as Japan's to slaughter dolphins.

There are many voices here, that claim that we should make another documentary's on cows, pigs etc. Of course, you are more than welcome to do that. That's the freedom of speech and opinion.

I believe this movie shapes our awareness on what goes on in the world. And of course, there are many more terrifying things that happen everywhere every day, but we should not use that fact as a justification for not taking any action.

We came to this world to leave it as a better place. I don't have much money, but I can sign the petition against dolphins' slaughter and hope that my voice can make a difference.

The movie is very interesting and strong. It's powerful.

Words can hardly describe how powerful this documentary is, and the lengths to which human cruelty can extend to. Louie Psihoyos and his team infiltrate a secret cove near Taiji, Japan and expose a brutal instance of animal cruelty. This film opens your eyes to the truly devastating fates of thousands of dolphins, who are slaughtered without remorse.Being an animal lover, and my dream to become a zoologist, this film has really inspired me to be active and do whatever necessary to protect the beauty of our planet. Alongside Ric O Barry, Psihoyos is able to clearly point out the error of these marvelous creatures in captivity, and how they deserve to be free, just like any other creature.

If you are one of those people that see my ways, then you'll be affected deeply too to take action. Forget the damn critics, this isn't a Hollywood blockbuster, this is a way of life for us and what we've become...what we've turned into.

Support the cause to stop this.

The Cove begins in Taji, Japan where we first meet former dolphin trainer Ric O'Barry. O'Barry was the man responsible for capturing and training the five dolphins that played Flipper in the international TV sensation. When the cast and crew went away, it was O'Barry who remained on the set, he lived in the famous house on the lake with the dolphins until the shows end. It was here he learned how sensitive, self-aware, and highly intelligent these creatures are, and more importantly how harmful it was to keep them in captivity. One fateful day his dolphin Katherine, committed suicide in his arms. Every breath a dolphin takes is an intentional, conscience effort, Katherine laid in his arms, took one breath and went under forever. This was the catalyst for Ric O'Barry's journey, to undue what he created, to stop the capture and captivity of dolphins world wide. Sound like a typical "save the whales" boring documentary? This is not your granddaddy's documentary! The Cove unfolds more like a spy thriller than a hug the trees documentary, think James Bond meets Jacques Cousteau .

Ground Zero is Taji, Japan. From the outside the town seems to be devoted to the majestic creatures swimming off it's shores. Statues are erected, boats designed to look like dolphins cruise the shore, and a whale museum is the pinnacle of the town. But in a remote area we find a cove surrounded by barbed wire, keep out signs and security, it is here that the town's dark secret lies. Every year from September to March, fisherman motivated by the multi billion dollar dolphin trading industry and an underground market for mercury-tainted dolphin meat, gather in this cove for the hunt. How this hunt is conducted is so grossly inhumane and dangerous to human health, that the fishermen go to great lengths, even murder, to keep anyone from seeing it. Ric O'Barry needed someone who could put together a team to infiltrate the cove. In walks filmmaker Louis Psihoyos and the Ocean Preservation Society. With the local authorities tipped off to the project, the filmmakers put together an Oceans11 style team. The cast of characters include a Hollywood special effects artist, two world champion free divers, an adrenaline junkie, and an electronic expert from the Canadian Air Force. Their mission: to plant and recover the HD cameras on the cove and under water. To get past guards and police they conducted missions in the middle of the night using diversionary techniques and military grade high definition cameras that picked up on body heat. The husband and wife free diving team placed the cameras under water while the adrenaline junkies scaled the rocky face of the cove to plant the cameras in fake rocks. Several times we see the team seconds away from being caught. Their efforts paid off in a big way, the audience is taken into the cove to see first hand the horrors that happen there. The footage is some of the most powerful imagery I have seen.

This gorilla journalism style of film-making may be what we need to spark the interest of the new generation. I believe this documentary may spawn a new uprising in the "save the whale" movement, starting with shutting down the cove in Taji, Japan. The Cove infiltrated my dreams the night I saw it, that never happens to this jaded Angelino. This film will stay with you and it will make you want to help the cause. 23,000 dolphins are due to be hunted and executed starting in September, what will you do to stop it? The Cove opens in select cities August 7th.

Winning almost every award it was nominated for, including the Sundance Audience Award, this film tells the tale of dolphin abuse throughout the world, but especially in Japan.

If you love dolphins, as I do, this film will bring tears to your eyes. You will find all those dolphins you love are not happy. You will find out what happens to the thousands that are not selected by dolphinariums. You will find out the extreme measures Japan takes to make sure you never see this film.

But, due to the incredible work of some dedicated individuals, you are seeing what happens in The Cove.

It is not an easy film to watch. I had to pause it and leave the house several times during the film. But anyone who cares about these creatures must watch it.

'The Cove' should be more bewildering to watch in its cultural context than for the subject matter it deals with. For me, the questionable approach of this film outweighs its ecological importance.

The exposition of the film presents environmentalist Ric O'Barry. As dolphin trainer for the 'Flipper' TV series, he felt responsible for what he calls the 'captivity industry' based on the desire to be close to dolphins which was inspired by the series. His emotional involvement makes perfect sense when he describes how the original 'Flipper' committed suicide. His focus on Taiji also makes sense as the town is explained to be the largest supplier of dolphins for maritime parks, which also means that it is here where dolphins are herded for slaughter.

In Taiji, the film starts to feel difficult. Japanese interviewees only speak awkward English which sounds automatically evasive. One would think that with a project like this there would be a translator involved. The Americans are being followed around by local people who try to provoke them into violent action so that they can have them arrested. I think it's not exactly hard to understand this defensive behavior when strangers in a rural community are so obviously up to something. O'Barry asks about missing activities of Japanese outlets of environmental organizations like Greenpeace but there are no representatives, just 'Whale Wars' host and Sea Shepherd CEO Paul Watson, i.e. yet another American.

There is some theorizing on why the Japanese government allows or encourages the trading and slaughter of dolphins to happen. It is claimed that mercury-tainted dolphin meat is being sold off cheap in supermarkets under different labels. This is linked to the Minamata-Disease scandal of the 60s, stating that the government would try anything to hush up any similar case. While it certainly true that Japan's government exerts a lot of pressure on the media, Japanese journalism is a competitive industry as elsewhere, sensationalist and driven enough to grab an opportunity to expose a scandal. 

The quantity in question (23'000 annual catch of dolphins at a selling price of $500 each means a commerce of 11.5$ million) isn't enough to build up lobbying power. It is therefore suggested that the government support for an uneconomic industry like whaling is a remnant of nationalistic pride of imperial times; Japan tries to hold on to this one point to show that it is tired to have Western countries telling it what to do. I wonder why no local sources are interviewed for this film to back up these claims. We have a Japanese nutritionist proving mercury content, some pedestrians in Tokyo saying they never heard about dolphin meat for sale, and two town council members of Taiji, but that's it; maybe 30 seconds of footage. 

Also, the subjects of whaling and dolphin drive hunting are actually quite different. It's suggested that dolphins are becoming an endangered species, which is true for China, India and South America, but not in the Pacific or the Sea of Japan. That means the dolphin drive hunt is as of yet legal - one may wonder and contest why, but I find it rather irritating that the film constantly alludes to illegal actions when this is not the case. The scandal is actually just THAT. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or Regional Fisheries Managements Organisations would be bodies to talk to about this, but certainly not the International Whaling Commission, as their chart does not include dolphins, which is actually mentioned in the film. Interesting fact on the side: Red Tuna (used for maguro sushi) is de facto on the verge of extinction, with the EU being a main exporter and Japan being the principal buyer. Any legislation to prevent that extinction will most likely come too late.

It's important to act against the decimation of sea mammals and help preserving them. It's a serious problem, but not exclusively Japanese. It would have been much better to point this out. Why show the slaughter footage to a government official to film his face in shock? Why not hire an exhibition spot in Japan, show it to the people and catch their response? The intrusive approach chosen here makes it very easy for political bodies in Japan to evade criticism. Since this reasoning is actually not so hard to come by, it makes me wonder whether the real issues at hand in 'The Cove' may not be a means of expression for Western supremacy thinking - an argument frequently used by emerging countries (China, for instance) to avoid being 'pinned down' by ecological law-making. 'The Cove' can certainly be interpreted this way, and may therefore do more harm than good in the long run by intensifying secrecy, obstinacy and distrust.

The story in The Cove is one worth telling. The mass slaughter of dolphins is a terrible thing, and I hope the man who has dedicated his life to ending it has some success in Japan. This film, however, is not a good documentary. It's a pretty stupid Hollywood film, made by stupid Hollywood people, who had to turn the whole story (which was interesting on its own) into an over-dramatized reality show. White westerners are made out to be heroes, and people of color either look ignorant, oblivious, or totally evil. The film never really looks at the business behind Dolphin meat. And it totally ignores one Japanese person's comparison of the slaughter to the many animals Americans kill for our own food system, such as cows. Can you imagine how we would look in a similar type of film made by Hindu people about our factory farms? And yet The Cove has absolutely no self-reflection (except for the discussion of dolphin captivity and Sea World). It makes Japan look like a uniquely weird and crazy place, while the white people are all just trying to save the day. The only reason this film won an Oscar is because some of the people involved in the project were a part of Hollywood already, and Hollywood loves to reward itself. The closest the Academy ever came to awarding a good contemporary documentary anything was when Street Fight and The Garden were nominated. Of course, those both have a few celebrity cameos too. But they're real documentaries told with a much more developed skill and passion.

So, what is the reason to be against killing dolphins??? 

Because they bleed when they are killed??? 

>>Cows,pigs, chickens... all animals bleed when they are killed for food. It would be also very sad and cruel to see them bleeding but it is necessary.

Because they are very intelligent??? 

>>How can you verify that cows and pigs are UNINTELLIGENT ENOUGH to be eaten by human? Who would set the criteria? Richard O'Barry has the right to set the criteria and to impose it to others? 

Because they do not need to kill and eat dolphins when they can buy meat of other animals, beef, poke, chicken??? 

>> Can you accept if someone say to you "You must not eat beef because poke and chicken are available now"? 

The reason why people in Taiji have eaten dolphins and whales from old days (for more than 400 years at least, probably more than 1200 years) is because such sea mammals have been source of protein easily-available for the villagers. Another reason is eating land mammals was a taboo in Japan. Most Japanese people did not eat animals like cows and horses because they thought eating them was barbarous. They were considered to be companies working with humans. This idea made Japanse people go out to the sea to secure source of protein. Killing dolphins in the cove has been just part of their life.

Maybe you do not know some tribes in Africa used to eat Gorilla. It was just because Gorilla was available source of protein for them. It is not because they are barbarians. Some people eat dogs. Some people eat seals. Some people eat snakes. (I have a dog and I know a dog is very intelligent. But I know I have no right to tell someone not to kill and eat a dog.) If you try to restrict other peoples activities, you need a valid reason.

Regarding catching and eating whales or dolphins, I do not see any valid reason.

Western countries' attempt to close down the Japanese whale harvest is somewhat comparable to a restaurant patron's demand to close the restaurant after he ate his fill so that no other patron may eat.

The dolphin harvest was not unknown to the Western countries such as Norway, Iceland or Danmark. They too used to drive dolphins to a cove and slaughter them, well into 1960's. British and American whalers decimated the whale population in the Pacific and the Atlanticto virtual extinction. South Georgia Island, a British possession in the southern Atlantic, used to be a practical killing field for whales (and seals). The very reason International Whaling Commission came into being was the belated bad conscience of those countries.

Let there be no mistake--I am no lover of Japan. However, there indeed is an element of hypocrisy in criticizing the Japanese practice. Why didn't the film crews of the Cove first go to South Georgia island and Nantucket and erect some memorial to the hundreds of millions of whales massacred only until a few decades ago?

İ only gave 2 stars instead of 1 because of the undeniable efforts of the activists in this film. 

Japan Government ignoring the fact that they are taking so much, it jeopardizes the ecological balance is one thing, crying for dolphins as they are being eaten is another.

There are some farmers trying to make a living here, they are not enemies of the activists. İn this film we see Richard O'Barry willingly saying how he wanted to physically beat a farmer. This is ridiculous.

The same thing happens in the cow farms or in the sheep farms. Go see a goat farm, people love goats, give names to them, call them with the names and the goats respond (so all mammals are intelligent at some level). And the season comes, people eat goats. İt is this simple.

Human kind must respect life. The activists plays an important role here being individuals that change the humanity in a good way. So why not start with the slaughters and massacres of the humans. İf there are some people out there to teach us respect life, they have to start with the human life. Thousands of humans are being murdered for no reason all around the world and no Oscar nominated documentaries about it!

The crew in this film should have given at least the half the effort they gave here, to make a film about human slaughter. Otherwise, this is a film about an old man crying for food, and two lovers diving in the middle of the night with tight swim suits.

There are few movies that I can say resulted in lasting change in my life or personal behaviour, but a couple of days after watching this movie the visceral response remains with me. I will never set foot on a marine mammal park again. If that was part of the goal of this movie then mission accomplished Louis Psihoyos and Ric O'Barry.

This movie is about the exploitation and brutality man has shown towards a gentle, intelligent and harmless creature. It can be added to a long list of films with a simple message - man is raping his environment, exploiting life, and quite frankly caring for little else than the profit nature holds.

The movie will hold you to the last 10 minutes, at which point it becomes apparent to all why Ric O'Barry's life has changed. It must be seen as the story tellers wanted it to be seen.

If I have any criticism of the film it's the amount of time dedicated to dramatizing the message with the Special Ops segments. I appreciate the risk taken to get this footage however I think the danger element was overstated by the film. You gain the belief all through the film the OPS is being followed closely by authorities, that they're every move is being noted, their purpose known, they're faces ingrained in the minds of the people, yet on two occasions they load up a van full of crew and high tech equipment and head unchallenged into the "great secret". This aspect of the film, along with the early segments showing paranoid Ric O'Barry moments in which he says things like "they would kill me if they could" leads me to believe the filmmakers we hedging between taking the viewer on a adrenaline fuelled trip of espionage and a journey of education and awareness.

It has it's moments of contradiction as well. It goes to some great length to show that Japanese don't eat dolphin meat but this is not adequately reconciled with the fact that the Taiji school program served dolphin meat to it's children as part of it's mandatory lunch program.

An obvious cherry picking of interviewees in the cities of Japan with questions about their food supply chain elicited responses that I would expect to find in most urban centres. I live in Toronto, where I suspect many people would be surprised to find restaurants here serve alligator and other exotic protein. I know that slaughter houses provide my area beef but I would be hard pressed to tell you where they are or the methods employed. The effort to show the Japanese as oblivious to the scandals going on right under their nose failed to be convincing in my opinion.

Still, a very informative and inspiring film. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about these creatures. I have had the benefit of encountering these wonderful animal at open sea and know them to be curious, intelligent, playful, with strong ties to the family unit. They are better than we are and this film helped me realize this.

I've loved dolphins and animals in general my entire life, and when I was 11 years old I was planning to do a dolphin swim during a vacation to Mexico. I was looking more forward to this dolphin swim than just about anything, and had no knowledge of the horrific industry that drives it.

So five years ago, just a few months before my vacation, I saw a preview for this film premiering on Animal Planet. I didn't understand the preview much, but knew it had something to do with the killing of dolphins. The next time I saw it, I showed it to my father and asked him what it was about. He didn't exactly tell me, but encouraged me to watch it. I was hesitant since I love dolphins and am very sensitive when it comes to animals, but we agreed to record the premiere and watch it together.

So watched we did. I understood everything perfectly, with the help of a little explaining from my parents. By the end, I was crying too hard to even speak and was completely baffled by the cruelty displayed in the film. I canceled my dolphin swim and decided that day that I would never support the captivity of cetaceans. I even started an ultimately unsuccessful blog attempting to raise awareness about it. 

I'm now 16 and my feelings are the same. I believe that watching this film was a huge jump of maturity for me, it truly changed me as a person. I encourage everyone to view this film and really think about it and what it means. I think that The Cove and other great documentaries about animal cruelty should be shown in schools, and maybe the world would become a better place.

We called him Flipper, but Richard O'Barry called the five dolphins - that he personally trained for the popular 1960's television series - by their real names. What the television series also created, with the help and support of O'Barry, was the multi-million pound earning sea park industries. However, after an encounter with one of the dolphins who died in O'Barry's arms (what he calls here suicide due to depression), he became an activist against the treatment of the mammals within this industry. O'Barry's interviews in this film highlights his passion for these majestic animals, that have proved self-awareness and high intelligence. So why, in a secretive Japanese industry, are the slaughter of these animals able to continue with seeming support from both the Japanese government and the IWC (International Whaling Commission)?

In an incredibly beautiful cove in the small fishing village of Taiji, Japan, thousands of dolphins are forced by the fishermen into the cove where they are killed for their meat (which incidentally have high levels of mercury within them, caused by industry dumping of course). The cove is highly guarded and activists are readily arrested for trying to see what exactly happens within the walls of the labyrinthine cove. However, with the help of a moulder from Industrial Light and Magic, a series of high-tec recording equipment (including HD cameras within mock rocks), the team begin a highly dangerous mission to film and record the sound of the dolphin slaughter.

In scenes laced with very real drama - in One Night in Paris filming mode (ahem, sorry, night vision) - we follow the divers and rest of the team as they risk their lives to set up the secret filming equipment. The sense of danger absolutely permeates the film, as ours and the teams hearts race. And the footage that they get is utterly astounding, sickening and horrific, as the sea water rapidly turns a deep red colour.

I'm not going to embellish this review with too much of the information from this film, as I feel the film needs to be viewed by everyone, and therefore will speak for itself. I will however highlight the fact that our species (humans) have to be the most despicable species alive, as the search for profit in a world dominated by greed, always leads to the suffering of other species. This needs to stop. So, please all watch this film, then go to http://www.takepart.com/cove and get involved as much as you are able.

If you are one of those rare people that has huge empathy for animal, don't watch this film This documentary will make you cry. There are graphic violence scene in the end of the documentary. It is really bloody scene.

This documentary is about the investigation in Taiji, Japan. The town where people hunt Dolphins to be sold for Sea World, and some of them will be slaughter for food They want to record what those people do in that cove. In the end they got the evidence.

This documentary is impactful and well documented. I do hope in the end we can stop hunting dolphins, at least stop slaughtering them for their meat.

The Cove is a call to action movie about Japan's dolphin fishing culture asking for a halt to mass dolphin murdering use for food. The film tries to show light of Japanese brutal fishing practices, and to inform and educate the public about the risks, and increasing hazard, of mercury poisoning from dolphin meat. The movie produces by Americans fail to do one thing: get the Japanese people involve! The movie is full of Japanese bashing, and there is little room to bring them onboard. The film wasn't even for a Japanese audience, but western culture! If there is something that is view to be wrong in Japan, wouldn't you at less, try to bring in the Japanese people into the cause?? The film seem to be a what western deem wrong of eastern cultures without giving proper notice on why they kill dolphins. The film just kinda hint at it, but the reason why people in Japan have eaten dolphins and whales is because such sea mammals have been source of protein easily-available due to the lack of Japan landmass. Japanse people go out to the sea to secure source of protein. The film likes to show the affect of mercury poisoning, but majority of Japanese people are pretty healthy compare to United States high obesity levels. While eating dolphin is a Taiji fisherman tradition, it's no different between regional variations in custom, language or diet in US where people eat alligators, horses, and deer game. Fishes here have high mercury levels here too, plus TNT. I believe this documentary should have been made by the Japanese people like how 'Food Inc' ( anti-food companies documentary) was made in the US to show, how nation like US giving priority to special interests over citizens' health, buying votes at international organizations like the UN, using state powers to cover-up embarrassing issues, and have irrational policies in it's farming and ranching ways. All similar to the issues address in this documentary about Japanese fishing. Rather than Japanese bashing Japanese fishing, it's Western culture bashing how they eat. How would it be like if Hinduism film US slaughterhouse? The Japanese people are made out to look bad, and negative light in this film. The film is told through an ocean conservationist's point of view, Ric O'Barry whom in the 1960's help capture and train dolphins for the role of 'Flipper'. He became activist when his lead Flipper, 'Cathy' in his mind commit suicide by shutting off her blow hole voluntarily in order to suffocate for reasons due to her captivity. Is there any hard evidence of dolphin suicide? No. Tantalizing information that yet have proved to be a fact. He spent the world, helping dolphins. Ric O'Barry and a A-Team of Mission Impossible film activists come to bizarro land where the town people adoration dolphins to uncover the truth. Why because Ric O' Barry has it against the Japaneses, he like mocking them in some scenes, because for the Taiji's Cove is the Auschwitz for dolphins. Taiji kills dolphins with spears in unnecessary and cruel ways. Yes, that's truly sad. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins to aquariums and marine parks. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. It's sounds like the Japanese isn't the one in fault here. Are we evil cause we love Flippers as a child? I guess-- Flipper and every dolphin fans are, since the show fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. While the film loves to talk about how bad it is to keep dolphins in captivity. Some marine parks, like Sea World, are nothing short of essential. Their main function is conservation. Without captive breeding, many endangered species would now be extinct. To say that, all dolphins shouldn't be in captivity isn't true. I saw the bashing of Sea World, really unfair. It's really sad that dolphins get kill in Taiji, but indeed it's well-told issue that need to come into light, and I for one appreciate the risks taken by the film makers in attempting to get this story out. It work and dolphins/whales hunting has decrease since 2009, but the overused of Japan when Norway and Denmark kills as much as Japan is chilling to the point that the documentary might be a propaganda film against eastern cultures full of conspiracy theorists and nation character assassination for the gullible. The producers did little to fight for more screening in Japan when it came out and cause if it was going to be solve, it should come from the Japanese people, not international heat. It's a shame. Hypocrisy is full in this film.

I wish to thank for those involved in producing and bring this film to the public. I believe there are those who tried to stop this film from surfacing to the mass market. At least, your effort pays in the end. As this film was seen by millions and receive good respond. At least, I am one of them. Dolphins are not the only victims, sharks are killed for the fins, whales are hunt for research as an excuse, tiger for skin, even other animals are captured for circus show. As humans which considered as on top of the food chain, we harm or kill the silent ones (Animals) for greed, fun and profit. Where is our heart or feeling? Is this to satisfy one's desire is enough to explain for this killing? We are not the only one living on this earth and showing kindness to those defenseless animals will make us better and kinder.

The cove was very interesting. I had no idea that this stuff was going on, and that's the problem. The more people who know, the better we can stop it. It was very graphic and successful at making its point. It really spoke to me and made me want to make a difference. The OPS went through a lot of trouble to expose this awful truth and I'm glad they did.It discusses the corruption of the Japan government and their covering up of the slaughter. It talks about the causes and effects of mercury poisoning. It gives an inside look of the horrendous slaughter and encourages viewers to take mart and make a difference. I recommend this video, if you don't have a weak stomach. It gets very bloody at some points.

No matter how subjective or against the grain you want to go. If you want to compare this to African tribes eating gorillas or south Georgia's whale killing history. Or how we eat meat, or how its traditional for certain cultures to eat for survival. You can go on and on. But the point is that this is inhuman slaughter. There is no attempt at minimizing the suffering. Its just plain evil slow killing. No attempt at all. Would you like a spike stuck in your genitals, mouth? then left in the water to bleed out in agony? If you cant see the cruelty you are a misguided individual? The point of this film is to make aware of the barbarity of this practice, which has morphed from traditional custom into an evil commercial execution. that's the point, Don't try to justify it, put your latte down. I have shown friends in japan the link and they are as shocked too. And it isn't a couple of dolphins for a village to sustain itself. Its hundreds.

Though I wonder why they have put so much efforts in making dolphins such an important species as compared to perhaps even human stricken by poverty etc... i realized it's a realization of how evil we as humans can be and how we should learn and see the world with a new perspective when we become selfish.

This film is a must watch! to understand cruelty, greed, political influences, and a story of a team of really passionate group of people who lives with a purpose...

Its a definite must watch, and even while I was tired.. on the way back from work, this movie got me on the edge of my MRT seat...and it was on my mind all the time!

If part of enjoying a movie involves the story and the story is factually incorrect, it often takes away from viewer experience. This is the case with The Cove. The story is so blatantly untrue and unfair that I couldn't help wanting to give a giant rolleyes in every scene. How am I supposed to take a film seriously when its entire premise is dishonest? As you know, As you know, The Cove makes some very serious accusations against the non-existent dolphin trade purportedly taking place somehow in the dolpinless coves of Taiji. True, it may be, that upon release of this film none of these "evil dolphin killers" showed up for the seasonal slaughter, but then, as the event seems to be nothing more than a hoax perpetrated by our greed-happy film-makers, it is hardly surprising to find this to be the case! How ridiculous.

Most of the film-maker's accusations range from the serious to the absurd. Take them with a grain of salt. (I would accept the charges they make if there weren't other numerous, merited possibilities for each scenario). After each accusation is made, we see "the proof in the pudding." They string together an unrelated sound bite, a jazzy sound track and a condescending narrative piece to prove to the audience they're right. To me, it's very transparent.

"Emotion is cheap" would be their mantra to film making. Many of these segments involve dolphins who were hurt by the inaction of the Japanese government. They shows us their pain by filming these staged events - they're crying and they look depressed. And why? Because fishermen are evil. This is the level of sophistication that they base their movie. What a silly, silly venue.

False docs like this one are becoming increasingly more common and have disappointed time and time again. There is so much potential to put together a quality piece of film! They even know when to use the right music to support their statements, they understand the power of editing (but abuse it), and they know how to make a controversial movie. For their next piece, I only suggest that they are fair, balanced and write an honest story.

Ric O'Barry shows Louie Psihoyos and the Oceanic Preservation Society the dolphin slaughter happening in Taiji, Japan. At first, he seems like a paranoid nut but just because he's paranoid doesn't make it untrue. He's followed and harassed by the fishermen and local police. Ric was the original trainer of dolphins starting with five dolphins on the TV show Flipper. It led to a world-wide trade of live dolphins in shows like in Sea World. After one of his beloved dolphins committed suicide, he goes on the long road to end the industry that he invented. The movie shows the international gamesmanship by the Japanese at the International Whaling Commission, the toxic levels of mercury in dolphin meat, and the difficulty of spreading the word especially in Japan. The OPS with help tries to surreptitiously film the slaughter in the hidden cove. This is an eye opening documentary. It's quite effective as a movie. As for its results, this is more of a step more than a revolution. Another film Blackfish is able to make bigger and more effective change. Trying to change Japan continues to run into a brick wall.
