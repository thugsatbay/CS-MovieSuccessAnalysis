### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Adam McKay is not a household name yet, but movie buffs like me know that when he teams up with Will Ferrell, magic happens. The former "Saturday Night Live" writer directed Ferrell in "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" (2004), "Talladega Nights" (2006), and even the popular viral video "The Landlord" (2007). Movies with Ferrell that have not involved McKay have tried to duplicate the success of "Anchorman", but have failed ( i.e. "Semi-Pro" (2008), "Land of the Lost" (2009)).

As director and co-writer of "The Other Guys", McKay brings the best out of Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, and the rest of the cast. It combines action and comedy better than any similar comedy I have seen in a long time.

"The Other Guys" refers to, of course, the detectives who rarely get a piece of the archetypal cops-and-robbers shenanigans that are frequently seen in action movies or on "Law & Order". They remain mainly at their desks doing paperwork, something almost never seen in movies. Ferrell is Allen Gamble, who is somewhat content with managing case work on his computer, and Wahlberg is the far more forceful and ambitious Terry Hoitz.

Their characters are in sharp contrast to the cops that Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson portray in this film (and definitely in other films). Although Jackson and Johnson were also funny here, I hate that the previews gave away their cameos in this movie. It would have been more exciting if the audience didn't expect them when they stepped into the theaters. Then again, that is the fault of whomever marketed this film, not the filmmakers themselves.

When Allen and Terry start working on a case they have a lead in, one they get to before other senior detectives do, a really interesting detective story progresses that would not feel out of place in dramas like "The French Connection" (1971) or similar action/detective movies to that nature.

''When you do a comedy, it does no good to reference comedies,'' writer and director Adam McKay told Entertainment Weekly, ''You want to treat it like a drama 80% of the way. Then, at the last 20%, you f**k it up".

The last 20% made this movie work, naturally. More than that, though, Ferrell didn't get all the funny lines, which is the mistake that many buddy cop movies such as the recent "Cop Out" (2010) make. Wahlberg is as intense as he usually is in most movies, but he has laugh- out-loud hilarious lines that he plays effectively with a straight face. His line about being a peacock may make AFI's Most Memorable Movie Quote list in the next few years, and the hot water his character got into in an incident involving Derek Jeter (making a cameo as himself) made the audience at my screening cheer. Of course, I saw the movie in Boston, but I'm just saying.

However, the 20% of the movie that was funny was further enhanced by the story. Again, many buddy cop movies of recent years that have tried to be "48 Hours" make the mistake of introducing the villain early on, similar to a superhero comic book. This movie has you try to solve the mystery along with Ferrell and Wahlberg, and there are some decent twists and turns that really make you wonder who the culprit is.

I will say that the mystery was a bit confusing, especially since it involves a Rupert- Murdoch-meets-Donald-Trump tycoon (Steve Coogan) and some financial plot. As a critic, I could pretend to accurately interpret everything that I see on screen. However, I'm not a Wall Street expert, and numbers involved in trading, stocks & bonds, and all the rest confuse me. Nonetheless, even if you watch this movie not knowing who's wrong or right and why, you will still love the ride.

The closing credits featured cleverly-animated financial facts pertaining to the recent financial meltdown, which appeared to be meticulously researched but still out of place. Their presence reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's anti-Nazi plea for humanity at the end of "The Great Dictator" (1941). His speech didn't fit the slapstick comedy of the first 90% of the movie, but looking back, it was still necessary to hear. I feel as though this montage of facts may have the same effect.

Overall, though, "The Other Guys" is not just another movie. Some gags seemed a bit out of place, and the tired plot point of the police chief pulling the main cops off the case still seeped its way into the story. However, it helped that that chief was Michael Keaton in what could be a comeback performance, and that he had some hysterical lines as well. The movie tells a great story, everyone in the movie is funny without appearing to try too hard (especially in Ferrell's case), and the ensemble cast works together perfectly. In a year of mediocre (non-animated) comedies, "The Other Guys" lives up to its hype.

I saw the advanced screening tonight in New York City and it was hilarious. The dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between Marky Mark and Will Ferrell is unmatched. They were so funny together it was great. The story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film. The only draw back was the length of the movie, they could have trimmed it a bit but overall it's a solid summer comedy. Dare I say this was Will Ferrell's best performance since Anchorman. It's certainly one of those movies you will be quoting with your friends for a long time. The entire theater was laughing throughout the entire thing..Great movie...go check it out.

Just when you think, "If you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all," think again. Ferrell is back and totally redeems himself from the flop that was Land of the Lost by giving one of his most genius performances to date. 

It does help that Ferrell is partnered with hottie Mark Wahlberg who delivers a superbly-angst-ridden-yet-hilariously-gut-ripping performance. The movie is filled with fresh, sarcastic, and humorous one-liners, non-stop laughter, plenty of action, car chases, and explosions, and a complex plot with a thought-provoking political message. Just make sure you stay through the credits.

I cant't remember the last time I laughed out this loud and this often in a movie theater. One early particular scene in the movie in which Ferrell and Wahlberg argue over whether a lion or a tuna would win in a fight is so well acted and delivered that I was left gasping for air after laughing so hard. And don't be too sure you know who would win such fight, because their logic doesn't go the way any of us could have imagined.

I watched this movie right after I saw the painfully boring Dinner for Schmucks. But that can't be the only reason I loved this movie because the whole theater was laughing and clapping along with me, so much so, that I missed half the jokes due to the sheer volume of both. I don't know what else to say about this movie other than "Go see it--it's by far the best comedy of the summer." Parisa Michelle, www.CelebMagnet.com

Just when you think you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all, think again. Try this on for size: Usual Ferrell comedy plus crazy action plus subtle political and economical commentary plus excellent soundtrack. The Other Guys is a surprisingly hilarious and surprisingly action-packed movie that will keep you entertained throughout without actually dumbing you down. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies, you don't have to shut off your brain in this one; you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy, there is a complex crime to solve. Adam McKay delivers his best writing and directing performance, while the excellent cast ranging from Ferrell to Wahlberg to Keaton provides plenty of laughs, plenty of one-liners, and plenty of entertaining moments that propel this movie past the slowest of scenes.

The Other Guys is about two mismatched behind-the-scenes paper-pushers (Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg) quietly investigating a series of suspicious events stemming from a unique bank robbery. Along the way they try to defeat their personal demons and try to figure out how to get along with each other. Unlike most Ferrell movies, in which it's a simple concept and improv provides the filler material, this movie actually has a mildly complex and heavy script, but still gives the cast a chance for a little improvisation. Written by the director and also Chris Henchy, I'll even go as far as to say that this among the best comedic scripts since last year's The Hangover. To add to that, McKay and Henchy pull a neat trick by slowly feeding you some commentary about big business and its mannerisms. The last mainstream comedy to attempt this was the mildly underrated Fun with Dick and Jane remake with Jim Carrey.

While this movie does not have the extensive magical gathering of comedians like Anchorman (then again, what movie does?), the cast still does an excellent job bringing the comedy from the script to the screen. Will Ferrell is a little more toned-down this time, but still has his usual moments (screaming like a girl, random quotes, random singing, quirky one-liners). Mark Wahlberg however, steals the show with his angry lines, his bitter delivery, and his outbursts. The only thing hindering Wahlberg is the PG-13 rating; who knows what more classic lines he could have pulled off if he was allowed to go uncut (Remember him in The Departed?). Smaller roles fill the bill in the laughs department, including Eva Mendez (beautiful as always), Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, and the cameos.

Even though Farrell has been hit-and-miss with the public and the critics, his best work always has been with Adam McKay. Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers were their previous collaborations and those three clearly top anything else Farrell has pulled off. The Other Guys in terms of directing and pacing dethrones them all. McKay does more than just handle the camera and let the actors mouth off; he stages some great action sequences and does a fantastic job directing a slow-motion bar sequence that displays the coolest slo-mo effects since Zombieland. The first half was so overloaded with funny scenarios, the audience very often was laughing so hard they missed the next couple of jokes while trying to recover from the last two. One scene in particular had the audience nearly drown out the sound of the audio coming from the movie.

The first half was absolutely spectacular and downright comical; the second half never had a chance to duplicate the magic of the first hour. This is where Adam Mckay's biggest issues have been: in the final third of the flicks. All of McKay's movies lose steam and slow down towards the end, preventing them from becoming eternal comedic classics. In the case of The Other Guys, he improved a bit by still providing some of the laughs, even though you will still feel the momentum slowly die down. The cop clichés, while not taken seriously, still mildly hindered the moments leading up to the climax. There were some unnecessary scenes; a little bit of editing could have really helped this movie. But, unlike the other movies, the third act stays afloat thanks to the Wahlberg/Ferrell mix, as well as the continuing mystery that was slowly unfolding. Then stay tuned for the credits, when the commentary rushes at you full-force.

Bottom Line: Honestly, I never thought that Will Ferrell would be involved with Mark Wahlberg, a creative script, hidden commentary (that unveils itself when you least expect it), and a soundtrack consisting of Rage against the Machine. Nonetheless, the combination worked like a great mixed drink that has you asking for seconds and thirds. The one-liners are flying all over the place, and so are the bullets. The Other Guys is the funniest movie of the year so far, and clearly the best surprise we've had this summer. Adam McKay continues to claim the throne as the best comedic director in the business, and this movie is more evidence. All McKay needs to do is cut back on the overall running time. This is the first Will Ferrell movie that you must pay close attention to (in terms of visual humor and crime-solving), and is overall one of his best movies.

OK first off I will say that the story was just OK. But that usually happens in comedies. So you have to rely more on the film trying to make the viewer laugh. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy and Mark Wahlberg, then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film. Ferrell really gets to act like himself in this film. I mean he is playing a character, but he gets to use his typical humor. Wahlberg plays a really angry cop and some of the things that come out of his mouth will really get you laughing. I actually laughed more at Wahlberg than Ferrell. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops; like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.

I saw the film with my 60-year-old mom and my teenage son and we all cracked up throughout the film--sometimes at different things and to different degrees. That's touching a true cross-section!! Although the latter 1/3 of the movie isn't quite as funny as the first 2/3, it still brought the laughs. I can't imagine why anyone who enjoyed Will Ferrell in Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers would give this movie anything below 7 stars. 

Maybe the reviewer who said that everyone didn't get the comic references was on to something...although I can't imagine why people wouldn't. There are humorous references about modern technology, sports, pimpin', geriatrics, !! Who can't find something in one of those to laugh at?!? lol 

I say DEFINITELY check it out for yourself! I needed a good laugh and I got one...even some true tears of laughter.

Yet another underrated movie given only a 6.6 when a minimum should be an 8. This movie will have you laughing throughout the entire movie. I've watched this movie 3 times already and definitely bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. Will Farrel is a genius at finding some way to make everyone laugh as usual and Mark Walburge is just the touch needed to make the dysfunctional team even funnier. I love Sam and Dwayne's(the rock) part in the movie all though I thought they should have gotten a bigger role. Overall a great movie and no complaints by me at all. The casting was perfect also. I hope there's a second movie after this or something similar to this because I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Great comedy.

This movie is very stupid.... but I love it! Will Ferral and Mark Wahlberg are both hilarious in this. People tell me this movie is bad all the time... but I don't care. This is a movie that I watch over and over and over and over and over again and don't get tired of it. I watch it constantly while trying to go to sleep. I think I have seen this movie more than any other living person. I have memorized most of the movie (included the soundtrack) and can't get enough of it. I enjoy most of the characters in the movie and think its great. I would definitely recommend this film to most people. It's funny, cool, and awesome. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The movie is funny to start and rolls along nicely but quickly loses all steam and finishes quite weak. Having every single character be an off center borderline nutjob loses something without any straight men to set them up or play off of. Mark Wahlberg played the straight man part well for the first half of the movie but turns as loony as everyone else before it's over. A few laugh out loud moments save the entire experience but it really could've and should've been a better film in general and certainly funnier across the board.

Not nearly as bad as Step Brothers but not half as good as Anchorman. Probably Semi-Pro and Jackie Moon levels here.

Will Ferrell is back since the disappointing "Land of the Lost"! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? "The Other Guys" is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre, but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.

Ferrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But let's not forget the other supporting actors (too many to list here), as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.

The jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory, while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging, as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core, but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well, this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries "Date Night" and "Dinner For Schmucks". Sorry Steve, this year Will and Mark stole the audience.

Having said that, the production design, cinematography, editing, stunts/special effects are good, and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors, and here is another memorable feather in his cap.

Overall, if you are in need of a laugh, see this movie A.S.A.P. This one is one of the funniest movies in years, and that's being honest.

Overall rating: 73/10

Hello again, another review from Thailand, sorry for the gram and spelling mistakes :) I always try to be very open minded about movies. And not to be to black and white about how a movie is. As always you can find things you dislike about a movie. Then you weight that out to the good things and then come to a nice average point to give to the movie.

Humor is a very hard emotion to please everybody with. Some ppl love the hard cussing in movies (Samuel L Jackson trademark) And some love the high intellect humor of say a John Cleese or a Rowan Atkison that are able to give you a smile from ear to ear without even speech.

The thing is when i started up the movie, you see Dwayne Johnson,who i really love as a actor! Really a great asset to the cinema. And Samuel L Jackson (the man is a old granddad and still going strong) i was like THIS WIL BE GREAT! Samuel the great Go beep yourself personality, and The rock as a duo perfect fit. Now i was not expecting a Danny glover and Mel Gibson chemistry (Lethal weapon 1 to infinity) But it felt good.

Sadly but true, the die pretty early and there replaced by a Will Ferrell, and a Mark wahlberg my mood degraded with the minute it is really bad.

Mark was not able to play the "angry" cop, he came over to me as a annoying person with no real convincing skills to make me laugh. Samuel l Jackson that made in his 15min (CAMEO i call it) with the rock 2 sentences that made me laugh like hell.

1st beginning when he lands his car in the city bus "Uhh did someone call 91 holy sh*t!" 

2nd When he tells Will Ferrell to shut up "Ai aij! you shut your mouth, if i want to hear you talk, i put my hand up your *ss and work you like a puppet" 

I can assure you, the rest of the movie is utterly boring. There is no chemistry between Ferrell and Mark at all. The don't fit as a team up the have a lousy sense of humor. Will is as usual LOUD very loud..

I wanted to turn it off after the TUNA story (trust you even for fans its a idiotic scene that made no sense and its supposed to be funny). I still cannot believe that the killed of the Rock and Jackson like that. Or even that the rented themselves out for such a bad movie.

1 point its really awe full..

I typically only take the trouble to go watch a movie if it has an IMDb rating of greater than 7 out of 10 and fits my genre preferences. So when I saw a 7.1, I was expecting a fairly decent comedy out of two seasoned actors. However, the movie fails on a number of counts:

1. Parts of the script play out like a broken tape recorder i.e. mind- numbing repetition of the same lines and similar jokes. It's as if the script writer got permission to put only 10 funny lines in a comedy movie and tried to squeeze every last drop of humor out of them. Constant references to TLC, Wahlberg's "I'm a peacock" line, the constant portrayal of Will Ferrell as a paper-pushing dork etc. made me feel like my mind was turning to mush as the movie progressed. 

2. They weren't kidding when they rated it PG-13 for "crude ...language". The movie is overwrought with misogynistic comments and jokes. It literally reminded me of being in school watching a bunch of prepubescent guys belt out one liners like:

"I didn't know they sold tampons on wheels" (referring to the Red Prius that Will Ferrell drives), or, "I feel like i'm sitting inside a v****a" (referring to the Prius again).

Orgy loving hobos, a grandma passing sexually explicit messages between her daughter and son-in-law etc etc etc. The list is long and I could go on all day. They really overdid it on that count. 

3. The plot is weak and devoid of details. It looks like the filmmakers were hoping that no one would care about the story or central theme with the "in-your-face" "comedy". Ferrell and Wahlberg are paper pushing cops (for feeble reasons that are revealed in the movie, and really not worth my time to list) who accidentally stumble into a case far larger than either of them imagined. Contrary to what the plot summary says, nobody wants a part of this case, and the only reason they get into it is because Ershon forgets to file for scaffolding permits for a few buildings he owns. Their investigation ruffles a few feathers and everything goes downhill from there. All of this while these two mismatched cops try to "find themselves", resolve their differences, and fill the shoes of the two knuckle headed "red-bull high" macho cops who randomly jump off a building at the beginning of the movie. Throw in a few car chases, bullets flying willy-nilly, and a stupid wooden gun that Will Ferrell totes around (which is supposed to be soooooo funny for some reason), and that's the summary of this movie for you. 

Don't waste your time with this one, unless.... actually, don't waste your time on this movie, period.

I really thought this would be good. The idea sounded like it had potential for laughs. Unfortunately there were no laughs in the movie.

You'd think with Will Ferrell, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan and Samuel Jackson the performances would be good but they're not. Wahlberg is as bland as ever. Even Ray Stevenson, an actor I normally like, is poor in this.

Its supposed to be funny that Ferrell's character is surrounded by super sexy women who can't resist him. That's not funny and the "joke" is rendered even more lame because the women in the film are far from supersexy. 

Coogan is wasted and what is the deal with Wahlberg's hair?

If there's one thing I grow tired of it's people posting a "Worst Movie Ever!!!!" thread in pretty much every forum on IMDb. No matte whether it's Avatar, The Godfather or Transformers, it's apparently the worst thing put on celluloid. With statements like that you need to consider some things; Amongst others; What are your guidelines? For example, I absolutely consider the Twilight movies amongst the worst pieces of crap ever made, but they are masterpieces compared to the Asylum/Syfy movies that are constantly spewn out...Does that make them good movies? No, horrible movies but ones that needs to be measured a bit differently.

With that said. I hate The Other Guys, and it's one, if not THE worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. It's misogynistic, crude, stupid, pointless, annoying, badly written and with acting that would embarrass a Porn Actor. 

When you have seven good actors in this movie(Keaton, Wahlberg, Jackson, Johnson, Mendes, Coogan and Stevenson) and you kill of the two who could have brought some fun into this movie within ten minutes(Jackson and Johnson) you better damn well make sure your replacements are up to it. Guess what? They aren't. Wahlberg can be excellent, but here he's whiny and with the emotional range of Seagal. "I'm a peacock! Let me fly!" Yeah, dude...If you're as homophobic as you pretend to be...Lay off that comparison. It's stupid. Ferrell...If there is another comedian as unfunny as him this side of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson then humanity is in deep sh*t. Nothing he says, does or tries to get across is funny. His acting is "ISpeakWithAMonotonousVoiceLikeThisHaHa" or "BLARGHABLBLAAAA!/#""!!!!" . Stevenson is surprisingly adept as the violent bad guy in the movie, I just wish he'd shot the Other Guys when spotting them. Mendes is...Urgh, a supermodel hottie who takes verbal abuse from her husband and smiles...And shows him her tits to motivate him at work. Keaton, oh poor Keaton...Why? Why are you in this?

The "Comedy": The only thing I giggled at is the vulgar crudeness of the hobos having an orgy in the car, and the dedication they show to do it again. It's stupid and pre-teen stuff, but it is just too idiotic not to chuckle at. Pretty much every other joke doesn't fall flat...It smashes through the ground, yodeling while doing so.

Action: ...It's a stupid, silly action comedy. Macguyver had better stuff than this.

Story: Inept, silly, stupid. Words that sound familiar by now? They should. The plot isn't really there, it's mostly trying to find somewhere to sneak in in between a mix of stupid scenes.

Overall: I hate the guys who made this movie, I hate the actors for being in it and I HATE the pretentious sods who gave this move such high a score. You make even Uwe Boll cry!

I really don't know what the thousands of people that gave this movie a 5 or above were watching. I like some of Will Ferrell's stuff and most of Mark Wahlberg's. I went into this film with the excitement of seeing a very funny movie. This has got to be one of the dumbest comedies that I have seen in quite awhile. I laughed MAYBE 4 times throughout this whole dog of a movie. The acting sucked and was forced. The chemistry was non-existent between Will and Mark. The whole movie was so unbelievable and juvenile that you would either have to be drunk, stoned or under 16 years old to think that this film was funny in any way shape or form. I bet that the Rock and Samuel Jackson were grateful that they only had small parts in this movie and were out of it after the first 15 minutes or so. I would have been happy if I were them too, when the script read for them to jump off of a building together and basically commit suicide. They got off lucky by being killed off as soon as they were. I'm just kind of surprised that they didn't survive the jump, seeing as how unbelievably stupid that the rest of this movie was. Do yourselves a favor and pass this dog up.

After reading some of the reviews on this film - I'm beginning to wonder how anyone can say that this film was hilarious. All I can think of is that they said that just because, maybe, like me, that sat through this pile of rubbish and wanted to get their own back on people.

I've watched 1000's of films, and believe me, I couldn't wait till this thing was over. Not funny at all, and worse still, the constant dialogue was just non-sensical verbal diarrhoea and extremely boring. Even my 12 year old grandson, who normally laughs at silly stuff, said the film was rubbish.

ALso, with a star cast like this, they all must have been hard up for cash. Now I know why Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson made such an early exit out this film, like after 10 minutes or so they are gone. No Wonder !!!! I'm just hoping that I can give this zero star rating because 1 star is too much.

BE WARNED - THIS IS BORING UNFUNNY CRAP !!!!

As hope springs eternal, I looked forward to finally viewing a funny movie featuring Will Farrell. Unfortunately, I was disappointed once again by "The Other Guys", a motion picture so repugnant that I was unable to watch it to a conclusion.

At the outset, the combination of Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel L. Jackson offered much promise. But the moment these two super-cops met their demise (about five minutes into the film) -- and especially the way their deaths occurred -- told me the writers' sense of humor was badly askew.

The next 15 minutes confirmed that impression. I won't say the humor was flat or not funny; there WAS no humor. I was embarrassed for Farrell and the other actors and finally had to turn off the DVD at the 20 minute mark. What offered great promise ended up as another Ferrell Flop.

"The Other Guys" surpasses water boarding for truly excruciating torture. It has convinced me to never again rent any movie featuring Will Farrell, and for that I award it one star.

Saw some reviews saying this movie was Hilarious. I like a comedy but the whole thing just seemed to be a very long advertisement for a Toyota Prius. It started OK, but then the same dry humour seemed to repeat itself. I suppose seeing about 20 people leave the cinema before the movie ended made me understand it was not just me that found it extremely boring. Maybe this is a cultural thing and people in the states like this type of comedy, in Ireland the whole thing just seemed pathetic. I can't understand how Mark Wahlberg made it to play in a comedy. Script bad... Just because you see Samuel L. Jackson on the list of actors does not mean he is in the movie (5 mins .. not much)

We went to see The Other Guys following a funeral. We were looking for something funny and uplifting, and had very low expectations of The Other Guys. The Other Guys failed to deliver on any positive level. Let's go through the reasons why. 1. When 2 of your 6 best actors are "killed off" in the first 5 minutes, you minimize the number of actors left to carry a movie. 2. When your only funny interaction between actors is between the male lead and the female lead, and it lasts for only 5 minutes of the movie, you minimize the number of laughs your comedy can have. And finally, 3. when you put every single laugh into the trailer, and leave absolutely zero remaining laughs for the other 102 of the 107 minutes of the movie, the audience will not laugh and will look for a way to leave the theater. I personally saw at least 2 separate groups of people leave and never return. My wife asked me numerous times, "Is this ever going to get funny". This movie failed on so many levels, with what should have been a great cast. Wahlberg was terrible, Mendes only was on screen for 5 minutes, Michael Keaton was given very little to work with and Ferrell was lost in a pool of "Huh?" This movie left me with questions though... why didn't they keep Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock alive, and have them compete against the other guys? Why didn't they have Mendes on screen more? Why didn't they remember to include any laughs in the movie? Questions, all left with no easily found answers. To say this movie is a waste of your money is one thing, but to know that it was a waste of almost two hours of your life, much worse.

One of the worst, if not the worst movie I had the forgettable experience of actually paying to go see. I don't know what everyone here is smoking, but has to be good, because this movie was as lame as a day at the doctors office. First, the plot. We've seen it so many times, it's gotten to the point of insanity. Two cops, one the straight edge, the other the wild man are teamed up and miraculously solve a crime that has confounded top investigative for years. Not only is the plot terrible (something about a ponzi scheme looting the NYPD pension fund, *yawn*) boring but this movie commits the cardinal sin of movie comedies: IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY! The jokes get old 5 minutes in. The running gag about how beautiful Will Ferrel's wife is and him not appreciating it wasn't funny the first time, and was even less so the fifth time! The two main characters have zero chemistry, and Mark Wahlberg is really annoying in this movie. The supporting cast tries, but they can't do much with this terrible script. I was hoping Michael Keaton would steal the show as the duo's boss, but it wasn't meant to be. The best part is, is that the scriptwriters of this dud and the executive who greenlit this project will be hailed as heroes in Hollywood. That says it all!

There are two types of Will Ferrell comedies the excellent ones like Step Brothers and the rubbish ones like The Other Guys. This film sees this team of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as a team of Cops wanting to make a difference and uncover a big plot. Now both Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are both stupid characters in this film and they both just play there usual roles and they don't bring anything to the table that really makes the laughs. Also their chemistry is just off as Ferrell acts stupid and Wahlberg just shouts a lot and none of it is funny. Eva Mendes is annoying and stupid as Ferrell's wife and it just totally distracts from the whole film. Michael Keaton is pretty good as the Police Commander and he is the funniest character in the film. The best moments in the film is the first 15 mins involving Samuel L Jackson and The Rock. They're characters are awesome and it's great but for some stupid reason are only in the opening moments of the film which is insulting. Now the story is sometimes ignored in comedies but I still think it needs to be slightly interesting and this story is non coherent and stupid like this whole film. The script is okay especially for Keaton, Jackson and The Rock but falls flat for the major characters and really takes away from the comedy. The style is okay for what they were going for a totally unrealistic film that I must emphasise takes away from the film. Overall this is just a poor comedy that barely made me laugh.

The problem I find with a lot of comedies today is that directors often have too much faith in their leading comedians to be naturally funny and almost no faith in the comedic value of the script. It's almost as if the screenwriter hasn't bothered to write any dialog figuring that the actors will just make up funny stuff anyway so there's no point. How often have you heard a director say "I just rolled the camera and witnessed improvisational comedic genius take after take" in a making of which is usually followed by " I just didn't want to cut any of it out" and unfortunately they usually don't. 

Comedy works best when its found within the circumstances of the plot not forced out of every moment. Comedy also usually works best when it's balanced with drama. The filmmakers have to realize that not every moment can be funny, you have to have a release before the next build up. Same goes for any form of audience mood manipulation, one cat jumping out of a closet will probably scare your audience, the fifth in a row almost definitely wont but these days when it comes to comedy everything is over played for laughs. It's almost as if the actors are ramping it up more and more in each scene, shouting out hey look at me I'm soooo funny right now. 

Ferrell is a funny guy, there's no doubt about it, but of late he's been let off his leash far too often and ends up rambling, falling back on his ever faithful man-child persona. 

Wahlberg on the other hand is not a naturally funny guy and he's left to compensate by exploding into an over the top performance in every second scene, so much so that Ferrell's character even points this out and verbalizes what the audience is thinking - "we're so sick of it already", yes Mark, it's not working. 

The other downer is that like Cop Out there's not that much chemistry between the two cops, though at least both actors appear to want to be there rather than just going through the motions as Bruce Willis did with Tracy Morgan.

To top it off, for what is meant to be a comedy, we're presented with a rather convoluted and surprisingly involved plot about financial embezzlement and corporate greed committed by the most boring, unfunny bunch of non-villains I've seen in a long time. 

There's a few laughs here and there and the production value is great but ultimately there's very little to like about The Other Guys.

I re-watched this movie yesterday and while it did make me laugh a couple of times, I still think it was an awful mess of a movie. Even for a mindless fun kind of movie. The plot was generic Hollywood buddy-buddy formula, but with some (not funny at all) twists to make it less been- there-done-that. 

Most of those twists are about Will Ferrell's character, even though there's one made with Wahlberg's character too. Those twists, contrary to the intention were the thing that made this movie really awful and a hot mess if there ever was one. It seemed like genre-wise it tried to be many things, a comedy, a moral story (the financial fraud part of it), and a good action movie. For me it failed on all three fronts. Comedy - tried too hard, the end result was more OMG what are they trying to do, this is not how you reinvent the genre! 

Also, the sexist "jokes" by mostly Wahlberg's character (also the weird treatment of Eva Mendes' character by Will Ferrell's character ) made it even worse for me. Moral story - seemed like an unnecessary part of the movie, but they went there. For the f... of it I guess? Action movie - The over the top Samuel L. Jackson & The Rock scenes were pretty rad, but then the movie started going in many different directions genre-wise so it was hard to watch it as an action flick, it seemed more like a mish-mash of different genre sketches. The main characters were not that bad per se, they were amusing enough, but nothing new, especially Will Ferrell's. He could've been from any other of his movies. Mark Wahlberg's character was typical rage filled cop with additional helping of sexist jokes, Wahlberg himself seemed kinda wooden. Maybe he's just not meant for comedy roles. Anyway, I gave this movie a 3 because I feel like it did nothing for the genre, it was immature and I mean in "Poop jokes are the best! Let's make more poop jokes!" kind of way. I guess that was the demographic this movie tried to pander to: people who think poop jokes are awesome.

The Other Guys could have been a blockbuster hit if Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson and Samuel Jackson were the main characters in the movie.When these two characters are stupidly taken out the movie,the viewers are left with the non-comical combination of lame Walberg and his big brother lamer Will Ferrell.This has to be on the list for one of the worst movies made, but had promise for a good movie.If a reviewer told u this was a good movie don't ever talk to them again.Please don't waste your time or money on this garbage.I hope Hollywood will start making good comedies with good acting and scripts.If this is the result, I want bother to watch movies anymore.I still don't understand how this director had the Rock and Samuel Jackson together and went ahead and made the movie starring two of the most boring actors in Hollywood.Wow what a shame.

It must have sounded like a good premise at some point. There are the hero cops, and there are the other guys, the cops who do all the dirty, nonglamorous work. And this is their story. Wait, that's not a terribly good premise at all. Who cares about the other guys? What kind of an action movie would focus on the other guys? This one, which pairs accountant-like Will Ferrell with hotheaded Mark Wahlberg, each with an implausible past necessary to keep their characters out of the limelight and on light or otherwise boring duty. Each is envious of their precinct's hotshots, played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. But then the heroes are taken out of the equation, and it's up to the other guys to step up and solve some high-handed financial scheme.

Ferrell and Wahlberg have no chemistry. They're just another set of mismatched cops with differing views on everything. Wahlberg pines for his ex, a ballerina; Ferrell is married to drop-dead-gorgeous Eva Mendes (whom he pretends is a Plain Jane, har har), and that's about the most plausible thing about the movie. One cop is straightlaced, the other is not. One cop drives a Prius, the otherwait, Wahlberg doesn't even own a car. So the only reason Ferrell drives a Prius is that it's easy to make fun of someone who drives one. Both cops are constantly berated and insulted by their coworkers for no discernible reason. They're not wacky, they're wacked.

Is The Other Guys a comedy? Couldn't prove it by me. There's not a joke to be found, really; the paper-thin characterizations wear very, very quickly. It's as is the writers decided that Ferrell and Wahlberg would each be a particular type  but then found nothing funny to write about them. And let's face it, having one guy scream all the time and the other guy nerding up the joint doesn't automatically make things humorous. There are no gags, although you will gag at the ineptitude with which this movie was written (partly by Ferrell stalwart Adam McKay). There are no hilarious set pieces, no random bits of absurdity. It's a faceless, directionless pile of pablum that can't even muster up the energy to lampoon cop movies.

The supporting cast is wasted. Johnson and Jackson are out of it early, conveniently enough, but even their scenes are one dimensional; they exist merely to show what Ferrell and Wahlberg aspire to be. (It should also be noted that the stunts in this movie strain credulity past the breaking point, with the lone exception of an early Johnson/Jackson scene.) It's as if the film were a movie about the making of cop movies, with all of the cops played by bottom-of-the-barrel stuntmen.

Mendes is terrific and beautiful, and she actually gets some of the best lines in the film, as does Michael Keaton as the guys' boss, Gene Mauch  so named because Ferrell, in real life, is an Angels baseball fan, and Mauch was the name of their longtime manager. On the other hand, Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans, Jr. (oh, no, not another one) are as hilarious as constipation; they serve no purpose other than to be annoying, cruel, vapid, and stupid.

It's saying something that the only real punch a movie provides is during its end credits. In this case, a series of increasingly alarming stats rolls across the scene, focusing on bailout money and bonuses paid to already-rich people who helped caused financial destruction in the United States. What that has to do with this movie is a connection that can be made only tenuously.
