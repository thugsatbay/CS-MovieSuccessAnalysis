### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
By about 2009 when 'Fast & Furious' was released, the franchise had slowly began to veer away from its initial focus of street racing and instead began to turn its attention to the action genre and over-the-top big budget sequences. However along with this change of style, the franchise was actually getting better and better with each film. Today I saw the most recent instalment in the cinema... talk about action-packed. 'Fast & Furious 7' is a no-holds, over- the-top and mindless action film, but this aside, it is an extremely entertaining and fun film to watch. With an all-star cast and some brilliant action sequences, 'Fast & Furious 7' is proof that certain franchises can continually make great movies. The most notable moment however in the entire film is the emotional and respectful ending during the send-off of Paul Walker, the film finishing with a montage of Walker in the previous six films, finishing with just two words, 'For Paul', this is the first time a Fast and Furious film has affected me emotionally, and it is arguably the best in the franchise.

I saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker shocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&F movie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using CGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than Furious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are looking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and violence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in Dubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars being driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah! What wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious and Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes with a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez feels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson is the worst, with his "cool guy" attitude and "bad boy" cliché character. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be watched.

The films belonging to The Fast and the Furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel, while the screenplays have been getting more tangled and apparatus in order to guarantee the numerous cast to have enough moments of individual showcasing. Furious 7 isn't the exception, and I found it very entertaining, while it elevated the level of drama and motoring stunts beyond any reason or logic... which is exactly what we expect in a film from this franchise. Besides, the sad death of actor Paul Walker's brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself. I think that, until now, I could found the validity in the wordiness about "family", which has been repeated many times by Vin Diesel in the films of this saga (I counted at least four instances in Furious 7). I wish that this new emotional weight hadn't been due to such tragic reasons, but it undoubtedly influenced my perception of the film. Anyway... what people want to see are the action scenes, and Furious 7 completely fulfills the expectations in that regard, with a series of outlandish stunts which are totally improbable but very entertaining. Screenwriter Chris Morgan found an appropriate balance between action and story, and director James Wan made a fluid and dynamic work. Editorial comment: the quantity and complexity of the stunts displayed in Furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the Oscars; and I think that's an excellent idea. There's undoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes (erasing of cables, face replacement, general retouch), but there's still an extraordinary mechanic, pyrotechnic and logistical talent involved in the shooting of those scenes, something which would deserve a formal recognition by the Oscars. There are currently two categories dedicated to the technicians who mix the audio of car crashes... and none to the drivers who risked their lives? Ridiculous. End of the editorial comment. The veteran actors of the saga do their usual stuff in Furious 7, as it can be supposed. As for the additions of the cast, Jason Statham makes a perfect work as one of the villains, but the great Djimon Hounsou is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal a magical application of digital espionage. Kurt Russell brings an appropriate style and personality to his character. And the female fight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is inferior to the similar ones in which Gina Carano was involved in the previous film. I don't know whether this saga is going to continue without Walker; it probably will, considering the huge quantities of money these films generate. My favorite movie from this franchise keeps being the fifth one (Fast Five), but I can recommend Furious 7 as a very competent action film, and as a solid tribute/final chapter in case they decide to stop here.

"This time it ain't just about being fast."

James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that "cars don't fly" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes. 

By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles. 

Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining. 

The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favorite after Fast Five.

I watched this movie first day, first show. It started with a bang and ended with a bang, and in a way that would have crumbled even hearts of steel.

This has everything one might need in a blockbuster movie. There were smoking hot chicks, electrifying dialogs, fantastic humor, awe inspiring stunts, and a menacing addition - Jason Statham.

This is a movie which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one you are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely beautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time and memories.

In terms of cast and crew, Vin Diesel proves to be the man of the series aided by brilliant performances by Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne Johnson. And finally the unforgettable Paul Walker. Walk into the sunset, walk through the rain... Walk straight into our hearts, and never abandon our memories again. For Paul... May your soul rest in Peace.

If you are expecting this movie to be realistic and logic, then you are making a huge mistake. Put it in your mind set that these peoples are video game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to make sense.

I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more about Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the event. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward action movie with no surprising plot and twist.

For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those tanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars, tower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic Toretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom is not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see people is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the heck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet powered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can just develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become absolute? 

Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this movie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting this movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.

As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional moments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or doesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it whats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch it. What a long journey it is~ 

For Paul

Just got back.

Here is my short review:

If you've been following the series from the start, watched it grow, seen how the cast have become a family you will absolutely love it.

The tribute Paul at the end is poignant and very touching and will just cut you up.

As for the film as a film, they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces.

Statham is Statham  all that Transporter / War fight training is still present, Dwayne, missed you fella, always need more Rock.

Kurt was fabulous , see how his role expands for 8 New chick is okay, guess she'll be promoted to regular

But this film was all about Dom and his relationships with Letty and Brian.

The action, hey take it or leave it, call it stupid or enjoy it. The fights are absolutely amazing..But the character beats especially the last 10mins (Dom & Letty and the goodbye on the beach)..Tej as (Ludacris) and Roman as (Tyrese Gibson) were amazing and they had their moments..Everyone did a wonderful job! the stories in this series might be questionable but the character work and the relationships.. NOTHING comes close to matching The Fast and Furious Family

The ending had the entire theater crying.. RIP Paul

Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.

This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies  Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).

Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother.

Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker.

I'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I enjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to action movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but the real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really saddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long way as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the limit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations were pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my expectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty of emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this puppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had nowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could they top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is like 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were possible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably exhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the 5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes another action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved every second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a couple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff. It's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another involves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but they are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a great actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always reliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was really happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very moving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It sucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics were a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing Michelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun villain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass and taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was good. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do well in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony Jaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His fight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. 

I hate sitting in a theater for over two hours, but it was completely worth it. You don't have time to get fidgety in your seat. There is so much going on that you'll be glued to the screen. I'm not sure if they should do an 8th movie or not. If they make one, I'll be more than happy to see it! But I think this was the perfect ending to this franchise. Whether it's the end or not, thank you for some great entertainment.

If you didn't know actor Paul Walker perished in a fiery car crash back on November 30, 2013, you'd never know it by watching "Furious 7, the latest installment in the "Fast and Furious" franchise. "Saw" director James Wan and "Wanted" scenarist Chris Morgan had about half of this mammoth $250 million movie made when tragedy struck and claimed Walker's life. Altogether, "Furious 7" emerges not only as a cinematic eulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled, super-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, "The Fast and the Furious" (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal road-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin Diesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker carried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of 2003's sequel "2 Fast 2 Furious," but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his blessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence "Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift" (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider "Tokyo Drift" the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that "Tokyo Drift" surpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued fueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise could put the brakes on "Furious 7." Mind you, "Furious 7" doesn't qualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the James Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a contemporary franchise with as many sequels as "The Fast and the Furious?" Whether we see an eighth entry, "Furious 7" has knocked the bottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some preposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but look extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and Asian "Ong Bak" martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original cast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If "Furious 7" marks your initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching up with the rest of us. "Furious 7" ranks as the top of the heap in a franchise that has never throttled back. 

In "Fast & Furious 6," Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of "Hercules") persuaded Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel of "xXx") to assemble his crew, including former LAPD cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of "Running Scared"), Roman (Tyrese Gibson of "Transformers"), Teg (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Han (Sung Kang of "Ninja Assassin") to help him nab a band of global mercenaries. The criminal mastermind of the group, ex-British Special Forces commander Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of "Dracula Untold"), likes to think big. As just compensation, Hobbs promised pardons to Dom and his gang. Meantime, Hobbs showed Dom a photo of our protagonist's long lost squeeze, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of "Girlfight"), and this strengthened Dom's resolve to seize Shaw. When "Furious 7" unfolds, we meet Shaw's indestructible brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of "The Transporter"), who has just murdered Han in Hong Kong. Later, he wipes out an entire team of guards at the British hospital where his crippled brother clings to life. The indefatigable Deckard vows to make anybody who had anything to do with his brother's calamity pay with their lives. After he ices Han, Deckard heads to Los Angeles and hacks into Hobbs' computer. Hobbs catches him in the act, and they tangle, swap sledgehammer blows, and virtually demolish DSS headquarters. Hobbs narrowly escapes death when Deckard detonates a grenade. 

Not long after his larger-than-life brawl with Hobbs, Deckard has a package delivered to Dom's house. The explosion doesn't kill anybody, but little is left of the iconic house where Brian and Dom's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) met and washed dishes together. At this point, Brian's wife Mia has given birth to a toddler, Jack, but she hasn't told her husband that she is pregnant with another child. Brian is struggling to get the hang of taking Jack to day care in a mini-van, and Brian's first scene at day care is hilarious. Although he is confined to the hospital, Hobbs summons Dom to his bedside and tells him "like a brother" to take Deckard down. Deckard stalks our heroes at Han's funeral, and Dom and he crash cars head-on into each other. Before they can do additional damage, an army of soldiers supervised by the natty Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of "Escape from New York") intervenes and saves Dom from certain death. Mr. Nobody and Dom share a mutual friend, Hobbs, and Nobody is prepared to help Dom locate the elusive Deckard. Nobody shows Dom a sophisticated gadget that can track anybody anywhere. Basically, it's reminiscent of CBS-TV's "Person of Interest" computer. Mr. Nobody refers to it as "God's Eye," and he assures Dom that the government would have caught Osama bin Laden overnight had they had such a doodad. The problem is that the individual with the key component to "God's Eye" is a mysterious somebody named Ramsey. Ramsey, it turns out, is being held captive by notorious terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou of "Amistad") who wants the same gizmo. Several outlandish action set-pieces later, our heroes get what they want, but neither Deckard nor Jakande make it a picnic.

Director James Wan rarely lets the episodic action loiter, and he integrates the late Paul Walker seamlessly into several exciting escapades. One incredible cliffhanger scene occurs on a switchback highway atop a craggy mountain where our daredevil heroes struggle to extract Ramsey from a fortified bus armed with six Vulcan mini-cannons. At one point, Walker's Brian O'Connor finds himself dangling from the wrecked bus as it teeters precariously over the edge of a precipice. Brian must scramble across the top of the bus before it plunges into the canyon below. Wan orchestrates several suspenseful, careening car chases. Another staggering stunt has our heroes propelling a priceless sports car through two luxury, skyscrapers in exotic Abu Dhabi to recover Ramsey's device. "Furious 7" rivals a James Bond extravaganza with its breathtaking, melodramatic mayhem!

When Justin Lin announced he would be stepping down as the director for Furious 7 following Universal's decision to fast track the sequel before the release of Furious 6, a lot of fans like myself were wondering who could possibly replace him!? The franchise wouldn't be what we've come to know without Justin, he has been around since the Tokyo Drift (which is way too under-rated) and saved the dying franchise from being released direct to video. 

Fast & Furious is never just about street racing but family & heist. Before you hate me, watch the first movie and Fast Five again then compare it yourself. You see the evolution of the characters and from robbing trucks with DVD players to heisting 100million. 

Now back to Furious 7.. When they announced James Wan will be taking over the franchise, a lot of us were worried as he was most well-known for his work in horror genre, particularly SAW & Insidious. Nevertheless James has proved he is perfectly capable of big budget action movies, just look at the air drop or the Abu Dhabi sequence!

Spoilers ahead..

The film started off with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) talking to the coma-tonic Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), promising to avenge him. Just pause and think how he could have survived the fall from the plane!? If that's the case I think Gisele & Han can too.. I mean they did bring Letty back right?

With all the hyped built up from the post credit scene of Furious 6, I was genuinely interested to see how Deckard Shaw hunt down the team and continue where Tokyo Drift left off. Instead we were introduced another villain, Mose Jakande, played by Djimon Hounsou (which is unnecessary and dull), Shaw was pretty much cast aside as a secondary character. We never get to see the team from the hunted to the hunter as Shaw kept showing up from time to time. Other than the impressive action sequence, it didn't really add much to the overall story. Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black showed up for 1 minute or 2 talking to Dom and you would at least think he might want to avenge Han right? But no we don't see him for the rest of the film.. I guess we just have to wait for the sequel. Shaw brothers might be teaming up, you never know!

Furious 7 was originally intended to be the first of a new trilogy but plans were scrapped due to Paul Walker's untimely death and instead the filmmaker decided it was all about making this movie for Paul. A lot of moviegoers like myself were very emotional by the credit rolled. It felt like the end of the journey with these characters you come to love and it was the perfect send off to Walker's character, more importantly farewell to Paul himself. The crossroad scene is definitely the highlight of the film and the reason I am giving this an 8 out of 10.

Part of me wishes they end the franchise here but with the highly impressive box office number, a sequel is nothing but guarantee. . I am very curious to see where the franchise is heading without the essence of Paul Walker. It just does not seem right without one of the core family member.. What do you think?

One of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the best in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific visuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping cars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts shivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street fight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get enough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if this wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional and the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved! Those last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the best action flick so far this year.

I saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have noticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more about the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual cars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many of us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action whilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the characters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision in not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be changed because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's usual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul Walker

The summer blockbuster season is just beginning and (for me) there could be no better film to kick it off with. From a franchise that seems perfectly suited for the 'popcorn movie' months "Furious 7" delivers all the fun, massively scoped action and excessive chaos that you could expect from two movies. The cast returns in what will be the last film for the late Paul Walker and as posthumous film appearances go, this was by far the most over-the-top and outrageously memorable send offs an actor could close with.

The story-line is absurd and for the most part makes no logical sense throughout, but if you haven't learned by now to expect the monumental amounts of ridiculousness from this film franchise then you must have been in a coma for the last ten-years. Entering its seventh entry in the series, the 'Fast and Furious' franchise have done just about all you could think of as far as what a car can do in a stunt-sequence, yet as another film hits cinemas you can only sit back and enjoy the catastrophe and high-adrenaline action that only surpasses its predecessor.

Yes the dialogue is what you could expect but regardless of its cheese-factor there are is enough bulk of a story-line to serve as a buffet for repeated eye-popping sequences with cars taking out helicopters, dropping from planes, launching out of massive skyscrapers and oh yeah, they still manage to add some great chase- sequences as well. This was something that was nice to see re- implemented in a franchise that seemed to forget where it started in the more recent films. 

Usually by this time in a franchise, entering its seventh installment, you could expect to feel the monotonous repetition of a possible stalling out. The "Fast and Furious" series only seems to be growing from each film and not only continuing to try and find creative ways to enthrall crowds with edge of your seat adventure, but manages to outdo itself with each new title. I am sure this film was much more hyped by the passing of Paul Walker last year and rightfully so, but even if he were still around this would have been a hugely popular movie among a massive target demographic and still held its solid blockbuster factor.

The family moniker this film carries is enhanced with all the cast returning, as well as cameos from some of the fallen characters from the last film. The Dom/Lety triangle continues to evolve and even delivers a nice little Easter-egg during the perfect weekend for it as we learn more about what actually happened in the events of the past couple films between them. Paul Walkers role of family man is expanded and helps create a very respectful and fitting way to send his character off into the sunset with class and a homage to what he has done for this franchise. 

Jason Statham was a solid villain for this film but other than his fight scenes and routinely popping up conveniently all over the world, he still felt forgotten in the extremely busy script that pulls you from Los Angeles, to Tokyo to the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi. With Luke Evans from the last film getting more layers to his characters, despite the lack of physical prowess, was still the more entertaining villain simple from the conception of his character in the script. 

Djimon Hounsou was literally useless to the story-line and his addition only cluttered the already busy casting line-up. Kurt Russell was great and with his few moments in the film he was able to fit in with the younger characters with ease and effortlessly delivered his suave and intimidating 'Russellness' to the point I would have liked to have seen more of him.

Statham's scenes with Diesel & Johnson were as visceral and rage filled as you could hope and Statham continues to show why he is the best in Hollywood regardless of being smaller then the men he is sized up against. Walker also had some very good scenes with Tony Jaa and the two showed great chemistry and worked to make some very impactful fight scenes that were good enough to say they slightly bettered those of Statham/Johnson/Diesel.

While there were some good moments of hand-to-hand combat with some nice shots, the overall cinematography had its issues. The camera- work tried to pull the most out of the choreography putting you the viewer in the right spots at the right time without over- editing. But the tumble technique was highly over used. The camera spinning with the actors and even rolling to pull you into the action was over done. It was clearly noticeable in the Tony Jaa scenes where at times it was as if the camera couldn't keep up with the speed of Jaa while still trying to stick to the predetermined techniques. 

This film definitely didn't let just the guys have fun either. Michelle Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey delivered a great fight scene as well. Both dressed in fine attire tearing room up they showed everyone that females can make up an excellent fight scene as well much like the Rodriguez/Carano subway fight from the prior film. 

Overall this one had a little bit of everything. From start to finish this film never stops or even (pardon the pun) tries to pull its foot off the gas. People will always laugh at movies like these but just as a Holiday biopic tailored for an Oscar nod, films like this have their place in cinema as well and the massive amounts of money they generate help fund many of those future projects.

After the success of the last movie Universal decides to go ahead and make another "Fast & Furious" movie, but Justin Lin decided to walk away from that and now we have a new director, James Wan who is more known to the horror genre. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Jordana Brewster, Lucas Black, Tony Jaa, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham Fast & Furious 1 and 2 were about tuning cars and street racing while occasionally chasing criminals. Then the third movie "Tokyo Drift" jumped a few years ahead in the story, it felt like it had nothing to do with the first two because it didn't have Paul Walker or Vin Diesel, even though he had a cameo in it, but it did have one of the original gang in it. 4-6 were used to fill in the gaps between the second and third movie. As time went for these movies they became more about huge action set pieces, heists, car chases and stunts while creating entertaining characters that you couldn't help but enjoy watching over the years. Fast and Furious 7 (aka Furious 7) is where everything it brought together and all the loose ends are tied. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O' Conner (Paul Walker) and co recently took down a dangerous criminal in the UK. Unfortunately for them, his big bad brother found out and now they are being hunted by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Shaw is out to pick them off one by one so obviously they're going to throw massive car chases and stunts and big punchy fight scenes at him over the course of two hours. 

Everyone should know what to expect when see a "Fast & Furious" movie, car chases, racing, people beating themselves up and good looking women. I've been a fan of the franchise when I was 13 years old the time when the fourth movie was released. This one gives you memories of the franchise from where it started, there are several references from the previous movies and it even takes you back to the first movie like the fourth one did. To me the one character that steals every scene is Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce. The big elephant in the room is the death of Paul Walker who plays Brian O' Conner, just a few months into filming. The film was delayed for months and has definitely had much of its content changed, especially the ending. Vin Diesel has said much about dedicating the film to him and it's easy to see. The remainder of his scenes were completed using his two brothers Caleb and Cody as stand-ins with some CGI on top. The added scenes do start to become obvious as the film goes on but if anything it makes everything more emotional and hammers home the series' message about how important family is.

Overall this entry in the franchise is entertaining from start to finish and it even has a emotional, but great exit to Paul Walker's character and to me it's my favourite in the series. I know there are plans to make an eighth one, but I feel like this one wraps everything up nicely.

It's difficult to talk about 'Fast and Furious 7' or how it's billed 'Furious 7', without mentioning the tragic accident that cost actor Paul Walker his life back in November. This accident was not part of filming, but did drastically change the story line and halted production for quite a while. Walker had not finished filming his scenes, but you wouldn't know it, as the filmmakers used a combination of amazing CGI and stunt doubles to add him through the entire film. It's seamless and flawless in that aspect, and yes, there is a very moving tribute to him at the end of the film, which might cause you to choke back a few tears. I know I had too.

It has been 14 years since the first 'The Fast and Furious' film graced our screens, and who would have thought that it would be the powerhouse franchise it is today. The first film back in 2001 cost $38 million dollars, which is pretty cheap for a big action film. Cut to today with 'Furious 7', the budget has gone up to $250 million and has added a string of A-List actors to this high octane world, including Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and The Rock. Whether or not you've seen any of the 'Fast and Furious' films, you're going to have a great time with 'Furious 7′. Do these films have smart dialogue or lengthy story plots? No, but that's not the reason for seeing these movies. Instead, you get a treasure trove of fast cars, big explosions, fantastic actions sequences, and fun performances by each actor. 'Furious 7′ picks up right where part 6 left off, where an over-the-top villain who seems to be able to take on armies of people with his barehands by the name of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after the 'Fast and Furious' team for putting his brother in a vegetable state in a previous film.

He has promised to kill each and every member of the team. Meanwhile, there is a security surveillance program called the 'God's Eye', which can tap into any satellite or camera and find anyone with in a matter of seconds that an underground branch of the FBI wants. This branch is run by Kurt Russell, who tells Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) to rescue the hacker who created the program (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a group of terrorists, which in turn they can find Shaw before he can kill them.

I know, I'm exhausted after explaining that too. 'Furious 7′ spans a few different countries and an avalanche of multi-million dollar cars that would make James Bond excited in more than one way. Director James Wan ('Saw') has perfectly concocted one of the ultimate action films that uses fast cars, big guns, excellent fight choreography, and giant explosions to keep the 132 minute film keep its super fast pace. There are a few melodramatic moments from time to time, but it's done in a good way, so that we can grow closer to the characters. If you can get through the stinky cheese one-liners throughout, which make you laugh more than anything, you're going to have an excellent time here.

On a side note, I'm so glad they added Thai film star Tony Jaa to this film. I've been waiting for him to show up in the US for so long, and I hope he is here to stay, because his fight choreography and talent is some of the best out there. Don't believe me? Check this clip out. 'Furious 7' keeps its laughs, charms and cameos flowing, and even though Paul Walker is gone, there is no sign of stopping this franchise, which is a good thing. Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer. Go see it.

Fast & Furious 7 was special for me because of two reasons. First, it is the last movie of the Fast & Furious series and second, it is Paul Walker's last movie. Paul died tragically in a car accident in 2013 during the movie break, leaving a huge void in the cast and in the hearts of his fans. This movie which was still in its production stage when he died, is a tribute to this great actor as seen throughout the film with its multiple references to "One Last Ride" and scenes in the graveyard where actors talk of loss, goodbyes and one last adventure together. There is a sadness and a sense of loss present all through the movie which speaks volumes about the place that Paul held in the hearts of his fellow actors who not only became his friends but also brothers. The end is a heartrending adieu to the actor and had me misty eyed and wishing Paul was still alive and well.

Director James Wan of Insidious movie fame has taken up the director's chair in this movie and does an exceptional job of piecing it together while also managing to raise the entertainment bar. Nowhere was it evident that the movie had been cleverly edited for the scenes that were done after Paul's death. The movie entertains and excites with its superbly done stunts with flying cars and dangerous larger-than-life scenes. The acting is as usual memorable and it was great watching all our beloved characters coming to a final point in their lives.

This movie is beautifully stitched with The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift and takes up from its ending. Jason Statham makes his presence felt in the role of a vengeful brother and his fights with Dom are memorable. Dwayne Johnson has a comparatively smaller role in this film but still is no less commanding and heroic. His catchy dialogues bring humour and the thrill of the breathtaking action to come. Ali Fazal of Fukrey fame also makes an appearance in the movie and manages to make us laugh in his very small role. All the actors complement each other and the acting flows fluidly with nowhere to show that all this is acting and not real!

All in all, I loved watching Fast & Furious 7 and while it was hinted several times in the movie that this may very well be the last movie of the franchise but still I hope that we will get to see another Fast & Furious movie in the future. Go watch this entertaining film which is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.

Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, "The Rock" is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.

What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to "The Rock's" lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for anything more.

The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. 

The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it "real" acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song "See You Again," which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. 

If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters.

For two years ago, I walked happy out of the cinema full of energy to get in a car and just road rage through the city - even though I didn't have the license. This time, I drove home, with the license, full of emotional memories. Paul Walker (and not forgetting his driver who deserve some love too) died two years ago, during the filming of the seventh film. This caused some delay on the movie, and the some scenes, including the ending had too rewritten again. This ending is one of the best endings in a movie I have ever seen, and for me it marked a perfect conclusion to the franchise. I hope. It will make me furious (no pun intended) if they decide to make an eight movie. There was simply nothing that I noticed during the film that can possibly trigger a new movie in the franchise.

But enough nagging, what about the actual movie? The plot this time around is as following. The brother of Owen Shaw, Deckard Shaw, wants revenge for what Dom and his team/family did to Deckard's brother. Dominic and his family are thereby hunted and they have to find a way to stop him. They end up teaming up with what I recall was the government, leaded by Mr. Nobody. He and his team are willing to help Dominic find his hunter, and make a stop to him, if they can retrieve a girl named Ramsey and her program, "The God Eye", which can connect to every technical advice in the world to find wanted persons. When they get this program, they can use it to track down Shaw. This is the main storyline of the movie, however there are some side story, such as Letty struggling to regain her memory, and Brain who tries to begin a normal life as a father and a family man.

As many already know, Paul Walkers brothers were hired to finish the last few scenes as body-doubles for Paul, with the help of CGI. The use of CGI to make Paul look like himself is remarkably good. I looked up online and found out that scenes where I thought he was acting on stage, was entirely done by his brothers and CGI. While I'm talking about CGI, the special effects are also a blast to watch. The movie does also a good job by giving a lot of SFX when the highlights are being shown, and stops when enough is enough. There are a lot of fast cuts in this movie, which pushes the speed of the scenes and makes the movie a lot more intense.

The acting is as always great. Tyrese Gibson, hilarious as always, do always has his moments to shine when he is on the screen. Vin Diesel is a great leading roll with Paul Walker on his side. Scenes with these two together are great, and we can truly see how close these two friends were in real life when they have scenes for themselves. The rest of the cast are great as well. Jason Statham is a cold, poker- faced villain who fits perfectly to the roll. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is not so much shown this time around. But when he is on the screen, he is the most bad ass character of them all. The only actress that I find a little bit weird is Nathalie Emmanuel. She is OK, but does sometimes feels like she is bored or something. She is also the most annoying character in the movie.

All in all, I think this is a great film. I had a blast watching it. Personally I hope they will end franchise with this movie. They couldn't make a better ending to the franchise then this. It has been a fun ride, but it is time to park the car.

The opening scene in the movie showed Jason Statham who should be the main villain but his character was not shown much power after the terrorist showed up. Like always Vin diesel's entry was good. The digital face making of Paul was an excellent job. The action sequence from the Ehthiad towers was mind blowing. For me it was the best scene. The ending part was too long nd at some point it was like when is this gonna end. But the way they ended the movie with a Paul Walker tribute was epic. Many of them cried at his short video...Me too. I I hope there will be a continuation to this movie because till now Jason Statham is not killed he is just prisoned and the way they showed his character i think there will be and 8 part waiting for Fast and Furious Fans #forpaul #rippaul

Even i have never see the other Fast & Furious films series to know the story line. Even it has the many Clichés of Action Films. But for what it is,is a Pretty Awesome Film (Especially for the Series)

If you not are fan of this series,that OK (but don't you dare to say something bad about Paul Walker) If you are not familiar of the series i cant help you with that ,all i can do is tell you to see the films series

This film is still on Theaters so i am not going to spoiler most of the middle & the ending because is really worth it to see it with out knowing much.

So what is so good about this film? Let's have a look

Story:This film taking place after Fast & Furious 6 Ending. In this one is about Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother and that is the hull story ,is the hull revenge story cliché and well it really works for this film because the main villain of this film is really good ,you know why is angry and why he want to kill Dominic Toretto and his family the story it has is really sad and you fell so sorry about this guy. speaking of which

Characters:Most are the original actors you like of this series are still here and we also have some new actors in this film and all of them are awesome. But let's talk about the big once (in my opinion) and that is Jason statham & paul walker Jason play as the main new villain of this series it was really cool in this roll,i was a little afraid it was going to sting in the roll of a villain because i have never see him play the roll of a villain but after i watch this film it was awesome in this roll it was a really good choice i enjoy every min of him. Paul play as Brian it was also really good and it was a good thing to see him one last time,i was really worried what are they going to do here because Paul died before will make the news there going to do other Fast & Furious ,to make a film without one one of main actor it was impassable but what they did,they have done amazing job. As for the rest of the others they all great and they did amazing job too. (and as for Nathalie Emmanuel is really hot)

CGI:The CGI is Unbelievably Awesome if i watch this film on 3D it will way more awesome & look really real. This one has the most awesome car chases,the best fight scenes & the most awesome action scenes of this series.(in my opinion) My favorite of them all is when the fall of a plane and they were after a truck with mini-guns.

Overall this new one of this series is in my opinion the best of this series and it is really enjoyable to watch it with friends and 3D when he come on 3D. Even it has a lot of the clichés we see in other action films,it makes something new and fresh to be enjoyable & watchable AND MOST IMPORTANT IT USE PAUL WALKER PERFORMANCE RESPECTFULLY THAT FOR THE FANS IT GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.

5/5 10/10 98/100 and 5 stars and will give it 5 Oscars to use the death Actor Performance respectfully

With still having strong memories of being left absolutely terrified by Insidious,I was thrilled to discover that director James Wan's first full-on non-Horror title would be the latest Fast & Furious film.After waiting an extra year to see the movie, (due to the tragic death of lead actor Paul Walker)me and a friend decided to buckle up for a fast & furious midnight screening.

The plot:

Finding his brother (who tried to bomb London) Owen Shaw to be left near dead in a hospital,former special operatives agent Deckard Shaw decides to get revenge on the gang who have attacked his family. Going to Tokyo,Deckard tracks gang member Han down in a street race and kills him.Wanting to make an entrance,Deckard sends a bomb to Brian O'Conner and his family,which they barely escape from being killed.

Horrified about the attack on his friends, Dominic Toretto receives a call from Deckard,who reveals that he is going to kill them all.Furious over the brutal killing of Han,Toretto decides that he must stop Deckard before he strikes again.As Toretto and his friends set their sights on getting revenge,they are shocked to find out that Deckard has decided to wipe them out by teaming up with a ruthless war lord.

View on the film:

Facing the challenge of ending the movie on a tribute to Paul Walker,the screenplay by returning writer Chris Morgan ends the movie on a poetic note,with the films theme of "family" avoiding the risk of being cheesy,by Morgan making the films final moments be filled with a real sense of warmth & sincerity.Along with the graceful tribute,Morgan makes the epic 2 and a half hour (!) running time speed pass,by giving each member on the heroes & villain's sides their unique moment to shine,from Toretto's wife Letty helping the team members successfully escape,to Deckard henchmen Kiet being set on killing O'Conner.Keeping the titles pulse running,Morgan lights the screen with an extraordinary cartoon atmosphere,which jumps from parachuting cars to drone hacking around LA with an infectious passion.

Making his first,full-on non-Horror movie,director James Wan displays an impressive confidence,with Wan using tightly held close shots,which allow the viewer to clearly see ever punch & street turn taking place.Despite a change in genre,Wan skilfully adapts his Horror film style,thanks to Wan using long,winding tracking shots which strike the action scenes with a full force,and also using minimal lighting in confrontation scenes,which give the title a tense,brittle atmosphere.

Entering the series as its first returning villain, Jason Statham gives a strong performance which gives the baddies their strongest presence in the entire series,thanks to Stratham giving the movie a shot of vengeful anger,as Deckard aims to take all of Toretto's pals down,whilst Tony Jaa marks his English-language debut as quick- witted baddie Kiet.For his last ever performance,Paul Walker gives a charming performance as Brian O'Conner,with Walker giving Conner a real sense of a close friendship with Toretto.Delivering the final lines in the title, Vin Diesel gives a wonderful performance as Dominic Toretto,thanks to Diesel perfectly balancing a frantic energy to the action scenes,with a quiet melancholy mood to the loss of a loyal "family" member.

This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.

With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, "Fast And Furious 7" finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like "The Expendables" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. 

The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.

"Fast And Furious 7" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director.

FURIOUS 7 starts its engine quietly, depicting cast members now back to their normal lives in the United States. But the wheel doesn't stop there (Statham), and with the arrival of a new enemy, the engine immediately roars anew and gears the movie toward an unprecedented high-velocity escapade, giving way to the most explosive, and probably, the most heart-wrenching chapter of the series, yet. YET, yes, because the saga doesn't show any sign of retirement, and with the new heights reached in Furious 7, the signage is quiet clear: the franchise is nowhere near its final destination.

There's a haunting poignancy in how the movie reiterates "family" and sticking together, while keeping the blazing momentum of the speed and action unperturbed, if not ever progressing. Centripetal to this theme, is Paul Walker's character's retirement, fueling the film's emotional core with piercing capacity . The level of action are thrust into all new-heights, and visual drama are brought into breathtaking levels. Whether action and emotions are immiscible or not, that theory is totally dismissed here, as both blends well to bring the attempt into a glorious result.

While the narrative is far from perfect, there are lots of reasons to shrug off such shortcoming. The movie vaunts a solid assemblage of action stars led by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. Jason Statham, plays as the main antagonist here, and he makes a decent job, so does Vin Diesel as the leader of the crew. There is no shortage of visual extravagance, as every high-octane action stunt is delivered with breathtaking CGI-trickery, magnifying the thrill into several seismic folds. At such instances, the visual artistry overshadows the real intention of the moment, and when it does, the narrative falls with no more than rudimentary appeal. But then again, with the level of adrenaline employed to fuel up the death-defying action sequences that looms up every now and then, it will be totally forgivable to lose thought of the said flaw, and just enjoy the ride.

Regardless of its faults , FURIOUS 7 is a ride worth taking over and over again, not only because of the level of action it presents, but more strikingly, of how its core is imbued with resonating message of family and brotherhood. Evident to this, is how it pays tribute to Brian (Walker), dotting the movie with flashbacks of him, to further build up his character. And towards the end, as the momentum further spikes, the film places Brian on spotlight, bringing the movie into a highly sentimental send off and a heart-rupturing finish. This film deserves 9/10.
