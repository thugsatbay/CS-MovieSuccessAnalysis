### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
So, here we are. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's latest collaboration is pretty much the definition of high concept - a runaway freight train loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, eight carriages of a highly toxic chemical and a worryingly curvy track ahead of it, versus two train operatives armed with little in the way of stopping impending disaster bar a one-car locomotive and their vivid imaginations.

It's not without its faults, but Unstoppable is a brisk, solidly entertaining thriller from start to finish. Scott has little time for characterisation or back story, preferring instead to kick things off via a pair of laughably incompetent rail yard employees roughly five minutes in, and then letting his leads fill in the blanks as we go along for the ride.

Washington and Star Trek's Chris Pine play it straight for the most part - their characters are the reluctant Johnny Everymen found in most films that rely on extended peril for thrills, and they've both nailed the mixture of brooding intensity and occasional comic relief that typifies movies of the genre.

Enough about the acting though - when you're watching a film of this nature, you want the action sequences to impress rather than worry too much about the story, and on this front Unstoppable delivers. Scott's track record in the field puts him in the perfect place to deliver the goods, and there's very little of the distracting, overdone camera-work that has plagued his recent output.

There's perhaps a little too much ShakyCam for my tastes but for the most part everything is shot with enough scope to be extremely impressive. The near total lack of CGI means the film looks suitably gritty and the pace is utterly, utterly relentless - there's no time to breathe here, just set-piece after set-piece with only brief conversational respites to quickly set up the next danger faced by our blue-collar heroes.

This type of film never goes down too well with critics and you can predict the reviews already - yes Unstoppable IS cheesy, it IS forced, it IS derivative and has all the depth of a puddle, but if you want to switch your brain off for 100 minutes and sit back for a magnificently enjoyable slice of escapism, you couldn't do much better. Highly recommended.

If you've read the synopsis above, you pretty much know the long and short of Tony Scott's "Unstoppable". Based on the real-life story of an unmanned train that went careening down the tracks in Ohio after a railroad employee failed to set the air brakes while switching tracks, this dramatization of that little incident amps up the thrills for a white-knuckle 100-minute non-stop roller-coaster ride- just think of it as an adrenaline shot that pretty much grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish.

The setup is plain and simple- on one end of the track is rookie conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine), paired with veteran railroad engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) on his first day of work. Frank and Will each have their own share of family problems and each bear their own reservations of the other- so there's a fair bit of tension between the two of them as they begin their shift, especially since Will is seen as the company's new blood employed to replace the older workers (including Frank) who have one by one been forced to retire.

Then on the other end of the track, some bumbling employee gets off a train in an attempt to switch tracks, puts the stick in throttle and sends the massive locomotive whizzing down rural Pennsylvania towards the more heavily populated areas. Corporate- represented by Kevin Dunn's VP of operations- and local ground operations- represented by Rosario Dawson's rail commander- can't agree how to stop it, the former as usual weighing the options in terms of dollars and cents on the stock market.

It is only halfway through the film that Frank and Will cross paths with said locomotive nicknamed "The Beast" and come out with a plan to link their engine to the back to it and gun it in the opposite direction. Tony Scott spends the first half of the film doing two things- one, emphasising the working-class backgrounds of Frank and Will; and two, laying out bare the peril of the situation. Both are deftly played for the nail-biting finish, which is guaranteed to leave you wide-eyed and open-mouthed.

By portraying Frank and Will's as everyday men with real concerns over livelihood and family, Scott and "Die Hard 4.0" writer Mark Bomback make the point loud and clear later on that that real-life heroes are really just ordinary men who do extraordinary acts of courage in the face of danger and calamity. Indeed, though it is apparent that both Frank and Will are the heroes of the story, playing down the chest-thumping heroics of their act proves to be a wise choice in painting them as regular people who rose to the occasion to save the lives of thousands, including their families and loved ones.

Scott instead stresses the magnitude of the occasion in repeated failed attempts at halting "The Beast", each and every attempt highlighting the destructive force of the locomotive at that weight and at that speed. Choosing to film the high-octane action sequences in a more straightforward realistic manner than his usual flashy visual style (i.e. jump cuts, shaky camera, zooms and colour-correction) also lends the proceedings an authentic and an altogether genuinely riveting feel, further underlining the gravity of their heroic act. Special mention goes to the sound design of the film, which in a proper theatre with good sound system will set the hall rumbling with the sound of the locomotive.

Because much of the focus of the film is on "The Beast", more screen time seems to be dedicated to the train than to our two lead actors, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Still, the ever-reliable Denzel Washington delivers a low-key but no less commanding performance as the dutiful railroad worker Frank. He also shares a nice buddy chemistry with Chris, and it's interesting to watch how the initial tension between the two gives way to mutual cooperation, understanding and finally respect.

Unfolding at a breathless pace, Tony Scott makes the most of a simple premise to deliver a relentlessly exciting action movie that plays like "Speed" on tracks. It wastes no time in getting to the meat of the action, and doesn't once let up right until the end of the thrill ride. In between, you get the story of two men, folks like you and I, who display an outstanding act of heroism when faced with imminent danger. Precisely because they are so relatable, "Unstoppable" becomes so much more gripping, and you'd be advised that this high-octane action movie is just the adrenaline fix you need for the week.

Unstoppable plays out like a basic action thriller that keeps us engaged the entire time. With the train as the center of the story, in a way we get transported back to the days of great entertainment, where the storyline is simple, characters pure, and the dialogue isn't overdone. Here is an action film that stays on track and keeps you glued to the edge of your seat until the high-intensity climax is over. It operates at gut-level mode, as we get to follow all the twists and turns of the main character, runaway train #777. Unstoppable is a summer movie action blockbuster released in a winter spot that doesn't pause for a breath as it picks up steam, and most likely you won't either. It's one of those mindless thrillers that was made so well you probably will miss a lot of the detail as the movie literally sweeps you away, which is what a great action movie will do.

Unstoppable is based on a true story that comes out of Ohio where we have a low-level employee who fails to set the air brakes on a train while changing tracks and the issues that ensue as a result. The director Tony Scott, no newcomer to the action genre, sets the stage for the high-octane second half by letting us get to know the 2 main characters: Rookie conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) and veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington). The two both have their share of family issues, which adds to the difficulty of being able to work together initially. Another dynamic we discover is that the company is forcing employees to be laid off, as evidenced by the fact that Barnes is being replaced by younger engineers such as Colson. The 2 characters provide solid low-key performances and we see the tension that initially exists turn into mutual cooperation to work together for a solution, and then at the end, respect.

Solid performance also given by Rosario Dawson, who is both the eye-candy and sounding board for our heroes, planted where she can see all train activity.

As the movie progresses, we come to find out that this runaway train laden with toxic chemicals is headed towards heavily populated areas, and our stomach starts to sink about the devastating possibilities that may occur should everything go wrong. The plan? to link up to the phantom engine from the back and pull it the other way, coming to a full stop.

It is fascinating to watch the failed attempts to stop the train, which seems to add to the power, giving the audience a realistic idea of how "unstoppable" this train truly is with it's 10M pounds of force going full-steam ahead.

In the end what we are left with is ordinary men putting on extraordinary acts of courage. Where there might be chest-pounding there are a couple of family guys doing what they felt should have been done by anyone in that situation, and a humbleness that brings a more realistic quality to the movie.

I'm glad that the sensationalism was toned down so that the thrills that the movie had to offer truly thrilled me. As others have stated already, Unstoppable is truly a "Speed" on tracks and definitely one of the year's finer action movies.

This film is about the attempts to stop an unmanned train full of dangerous chemicals travelling at high speed, endangering the lives of thousands of people living along the tracks.

"Unstoppable" gets right to the point, action already starts ten minutes into the film. After that, the thrills get better and better. As a result, the film keeps you glued to the screen with increasing intensity.

Early on in the film, I wondered if there was enough to fill the screen time, but there was actually enough to make it action packed, without slow, pacing scenes to interrupt the action. "Unstoppable" is a good action film, relatively free from blood and violence which is rather rare for an action film these days.

Loosely based on a true story from 2001, UNSTOPPABLE is a tension packed, heart-racing juggernaut of a movie  about an unmanned, runaway train carrying a payload of highly flammable fuel and toxic waste that is heading straight for the densely populated of Stanton, Pennsylvania at 70mph.

Several human errors by an incompetent train driver Dewey (Ethan Suplee  "Randy" from My Name is Earl) and his colleagues allows the out of control train to leave the depot without air brakes and security cut out systems  and from then on, the race is on to try and stop this out of control half-mile long train "bomb" from devastating a city.

After several attempt fail  train driver Frank (played by double Oscar winning Denzel Washington - Training Day, Man on Fire, Malcolm X, Cry Freedom), and rookie conductor Will (Chris Pine - Star Trek) find themselves isolated as the last resort to try and prevent a disaster of epic proportions 

Ably directed by Tony Scott (who has something of a history with trains and Denzel Washington  Taking of Pelham 123, Man on Fire), UNSTOPPABLE features some really good camera work, low ground shots, blur in movement, close-up action  and a very imaginative use of sound and music  (this film can be really loud in parts)  are things that really emphasizes the feeling of locomotive power, speed and imminent destruction  I could swear that my seat was shaking as the train speed increased  

Throw in some human drama, agitated animals and a train load of school kids in peril  not to mention the annihilation of a whole city  and you have all the ingredients required for an edge of the seat action thriller 

There are very good acting performances also by the supporting cast, namely Rosario Dawson as Connie Hooper the senior train dispatcher who does an admirable job in keeping the tension up and she is the "glue" that holds all the dialogue, characters and plot lines together  Kevin Dunn as Oscar Galvin as Hooper's boss and Kevin Corrigan as Inspector Werner  a train safety inspector.

UNSTOPPABLE is very recommended and is a film that really needs to be watched on the big screen in a cinema that has really good surround sound to get the full benefit of the camera work and soundtrack.

UNSTOPPABLE is 98 mins long, is an 12A certificate and will be on general release from Weds 24th November 2010

Unstoppable is a pulse-pounding runaway thrill ride with iron-sided save-the-day heroism on display courtesy of Washington, Pine and Dawson.

Spoil sports have been grousing that Unstoppable can't possibly be "inspired by true events." In fact, the runaway AWVR777 in Unstoppable is based on the real-life CSX8888 (crew) Y11615 incident that took place in 2001.

CSX8888 was a single engine pulling 47 cars, 22 of them loaded, for in-yard car switching. The Final Report on the CSX8888 incident is available on the Internet along with other accounts and documentation.

All six "gross errors" committed by the engineer responsible for CSX8888 are reproduced in Unstoppable, one of them being sugar coated with magic pixie dust, when the engine selector handle auto-magically pops out of "dynamic brake" and into "power" mode, with the throttle handle set to 8, the maximum setting.

The dynamic brake should never have been set during yard operations (gross error #4). Dynamic braking is optimal at speeds >=40MPH and it is ineffective at speeds <10MPH (except on AC locomotives, of which 8888 wasn't).

The independent brake of the locomotive was also set, which nullified the alerter switch system, which would have otherwise acted as a circuit breaker to the incorrect selector and throttle settings.

All six gross errors really happened and had to be made in the proper sequence in order to result in a powered runaway.

Two CSX employees chased CSX8888 in a private vehicle to a grade crossing, because they feared that its engineer had suffered an heart attack at the controls. The engineer had already stepped off the moving train back at the yard (gross error # 3). The CSX employees intercepted CSX8888, but were unable to board it.

The runaway CSX8888 did have hazardous cargo on board, variously reported as two cars of molten phenol acid (CNN) or molten sulfur (local Ohio news sources), the latter being less hazardous than the former, although both are toxic. The two hazmat cars were in the middle of the train and they were not considered to be at risk if the train had derailed. The hazmat cars were far enough in, for the surrounding terrain, that they should have remained on the track even if an engine derailment had succeeded.

CSX8888 had an average speed of 30-35MPH and may have been going as fast as 47MPH at one point. Four attempts were made at derailing CSX8888, three by diverting it through sidings and one by using a portable derail. CSX8888 dislodged the portable derail and threw it from the tracks. All attempts to derail CSX8888 failed.

CSX8888 was eventually stopped by a pursuit locomotive, running in reverse, CSX6462 (crew) Q63615. Avoiding a collision course, CSX6462 had to run in reverse, which blindsided the engineer during right hand turns. That required the conductor to setup at the rear of the locomotive, now the front, so that the conductor could spot for his engineer. The maximum unloaded speed rating for CSX6462 was 30MPH. It had to achieve speeds in excess of 50MPH to catch up with CSX8888. This meant that the conductor's end of CSX6462 swayed 18" from side-to-side at times. Had CSX6462 derailed, there would have been no way for the conductor to survive. Life and limb were definitely at risk.

CSX8888 was stopped without loss of life, limb and/or property.

When CSX6462 caught up with the runaway, it coupled from the rear and then the engineer applied CSX6462's dynamic brakes, to slow CSX8888 down, exercising great care not to break the train apart between the two locomotives. Once CSX8888 slowed to less than 11MPH, a prepositioned engineer was able to run alongside, board it and take control of CSX8888, bringing it to an orderly stop.

Almost all of these elements are incorporated into the story of Unstoppable, albeit in Tony Scott's ScottFree way. It's reality x2 and all of that's in the service of delivering a ripping yarn. 

The same people complaining about Unstoppable probably swallowed everything Scott & Co served up in Top Gun without chewing.

Unstoppable does make a point of belaboring the fact that the hoses for the air brake system were never connected, but that happens to be SOP for in-yard flat car switching. You can't properly "kick" cars if their hoses are still connected. (That's my only beef.) 

There are plenty of other things that never happened, or couldn't have happened, but none of that matters thanks to the acting talent on board.

Denzel Washington's Frank Barnes is a seasoned engineer and 28-year AWVR veteran who never shows any of is his inward concerns, whether they be about job security in downsizing times or worry for his two daughters working their way through college. Denzel's Barnes is all about the j-o-b and doing it right. Chris Pine's Will Colson is relatively new to the ranks of conductors. Rumor in the yard is that Colson's a beneficiary of union boss nepotism. Will's also got domestic problems at home that distract him from the job. This sets up professional tension when Barnes are Colson are paired to crew AWVR1206 for a routine run. Although Barnes has seniority, Colson's technically in charge. Pine & Washington have a lot of tension-cutting fun with this.

Rosario Dawson plays Connie Hooper, a rail control supervisor, who has got to plow through considerable BS, not only to find out what's going on with double-engine AWVR777, but also to figure out how best to deal with it, once it's determined that 777 is a fully powered runaway. Even after "corporate" cuts Connie out of the CBA/CYA loop, Dawson makes us believe that Connie is going to do the right thing, no matter what.

Kevin Corrigan deserves special mention for his turn as FRAMPE Inspector Werner. He convincingly supplies crucial factoids needed to solve the problem of 777, with a Spock-like just-in-time manner. 

That's Entertainment!

Even though I did not care whatsoever for the fates of any of the stick-figure characters that populate Tony Scott's new movie "Unstoppable" and despite the fact that I still have some qualms with his directing style, I must confess that this new runaway-train movie won me over. It works on the principles of late afternoon escapism and it's quite efficient as a nail-biter. Kicking off to big bursts of kinetic action almost right from the beginning and lasting for a taut ninety-eight minutes, it proved itself as one of the more wholesomely entertaining action movies I've seen in the last half of the year.

The movie is based (loosely) on the CSX 8888 incident of 2001, in which a freight train ran amok and unmanned across the state of Ohio for two hours. Here the setting is switched to Pennsylvania and it's running at such high speeds that it threatens to destroy Stanton should it derail itself on an elevated railway and smash its toxic cargo. Of course, for the conventions of the action/escapism movie plot, we've got two troubled heroes who are just going through the motions of their not-so-happy lives when they assume the Superman personality and race against time to stop the train.

The train is the real star of the movie. More interesting than the people trying to control it. Director Tony Scott gives us several impressive and creative shots of the half-mile-long mechanical monster as it rampages around. Listen carefully to the soundtrack and amongst all the crashes and grinding sounds you'll hear noises reminiscent of the tyrannosaurus in Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park." The movie almost seems like a big-budget homage to Spielberg's early-career movie "Duel" in which you had an innocent man being pursued by a giant tractor-trailer.

The characters are modeled after Action Movie 101 Writing stereotypes. You know, the veteran and the rookie. One of them is splitting up with his wife, the other is having a hard time maintaining a relationship with his daughters. You've got the noble yardmaster wanting to save lives and the greedy, vulgarity-spitting corporate executive whose more concerned about how much dough he's lost. And, of course, it takes a major catastrophe in which lives are risked in order to glue everything back together again. And no, morbid as it sounds, I didn't care who lived and who died.

However, *however* the filmmakers are smart enough to play with this to their advantage. They do not waste any more time than they really need to with this flat caricatures and instead devote as much of the brief running time as they can to very gritty action sequences. I must commend Mr. Scott for his ability to coordinate his pyrotechnics crew. Although I still detest his overly extravagant dolly shots and irksome "quick zooms" (in which the camera inches in and out of people for no reason at all) he does hold your attention when letting loose a wave of inertia. The last quarter of the movie is consumed by an enormous, very intense action sequence that develops suspense and nail-biting tension reminiscent of "Back to the Future." Complications are thrown in and as they kept on coming, I gradually discovered myself nervously toying with the zipper of my jacket. He also does a fantastic job of balancing sequences with "Live Television" shots as news cameras record the incident.

"Unstoppable" is not a work of art, but heck, it's not trying to be. Movies are meant to be one of two things: art or escapism. "Unstoppable" is the latter. It achieves exactly what it is targeting: ninety-eight minutes of blood-pumping action, smart-alec dialogue, and a barrel of fun for all who participate. It's more fun (and less painful, for me) than any roller coaster I can remember being on at the fair. On the basis of it being a solid matinée thriller, I liked the movie.

Denzel Washington, as the wise old train veteran, is his usual self: sincere and convincing. Chris Pine is also in fine form as the goodhearted but troubled rookie whom he finds himself both bickering and laughing with. Rosario Dawson, an underrated actress, turns in another strong performance as the yardmaster supervising the disaster. And Kevin Dunn is sinister despite the two-dimensional character he's given to play. Supporting roles are played mechanically but well by Ethan Suplee, Meagan Tandy, Elizabeth Mathis, and Jessy Schram.

P.S., the movie almost shoots itself in the foot at the end, but just ignore that, as everything before it works just fine.

I will make this short and sweet, which is exactly what the movie could have been if anyone with half a brain had been in charge of stopping this train.

The acting and direction were adequate, and the movie was not a complete waste of time, but it was just absolutely ridiculous that the train could not be stopped sooner. *Minor Spoiler* There is a scene about 40 minutes in, were they attempt to stop the train by putting a moving train in front of the runaway train and to gently try and bring the speed of the runaway train down by using the brakes of the front train. Now this seems sensible if it weren't for the man dangling from a helicopter who will be lowered onto the roof of the train when the speed drops below 40 miles per hour...HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! If the front train and the runaway train are touching each other then you could literally walk across from the one train to the other. A 1 year old could have crawled between the 2 trains. There are so many shots of the 2 trains touching that I lost a lot of respect for the movie after this. It was a completely over engineered rescue just for the sake of suspense. My grandmother and I could have stopped this train...and that's with my grandmother doing all her own stunts.

Simple, Thrilling, and Very Entertaining. Unstoppable never tries to be anything more than it is. It follows a runaway train that occurred in Pennsylvania and the two men that try to stop it. First off, I gotta five Tony Scott credit for making a film about trains, that in itself is pretty interesting. How many people know about and use trains regularly? Then take that and turn into one of the most suspenseful, entertaining films of the year culminates into a really good time. The film's opening credits starts with how the train was lost and runs away, so right off the bat you know that it's not going to be a dull film. Before any of the main characters are brought into the story the antagonist and therefore the action get underway. Your then introduced to Will, played by Chris Pine, and Frank, played by Denzel Washington. Will is the rookie conductor that is placed under the veterans Frank's wing. Then you have Connie, played by Rosario Dawson, as the head of all the trains currently running, basically a conductor that oversees all operations, who is in charge of finding a solution to the runaway train, while also dealing with the corporate suits, mainly Oscar Galvin, played by Kevin Dunn, who are more interested in stock prices and money losses then the overall safety and physical damage the train could cause. So, after some failed attempts to stop the train, Denzel comes up with a plan to stop it, and this is where Will and Frank become involved with the runaway.

Tony Scott does a pretty good job of making the runaway train look menacing, almost like a monster that no matter what you do always keeps coming for you. The majority of special effects and stunt work were done realistically with very little CGI being used, which for me is always a plus. With it being based on a true story he definitely uses a lot of tactics to make it feel less like a film and more like your actually watching the action happen presently. There's a lot of bird eye shots of the trains making it feel like a news helicopters are shooting it, while also cutting to news broadcasts following the runaway train through the majority of the film creating a more realistic view of the whole story. He also filmed on location in Pennsylvania, which was pretty cool living in central PA and having the opportunity to talk with some of the crew. 

As for the characters, the first half of the film, is where the majority of the very little character development comes into play. Will and Frank bicker back and forth at each other, when unsurprisingly they find a common bond through broken families with their wives and children. There are also many conversations, which mostly turn into arguments, between Connie and Oscar about how to stop the runaway train and the potential problems it could cause. Yet, due to the pacing and strategic place of key conversations you end up caring about the characters and are pulling for them to get out of this disaster alive. The most important and character revealing dialogue occurs during the more explosion filled scenes with the train. 

Overall, it's a pretty fun time, and never has a boring moment. Just when you think the dialogue may be getting a bit to breathy and boring, Scott crashes the runaway into some object causing a major explosion. It's one of those no brain activity films that you can just sit back and enjoy. The characters are there and Scott makes sure not to fill the runtime up with too much dialogue, but with just enough to develop Frank, Will, and Connie into people we want to see succeed. Lastly, it doesn't try to be anything more than it is. It's a film about a runaway train and the people trying to stop it, that's it. Unstoppable is a thrilling ride and a guaranteed enjoyable viewing.

I am a railroad buff. A Lifelong railroad buff. I love trains. Love anything to do with trains. And so I went to see this movie expecting to at least enjoy a movie about trains. But if I save just one person from spending money on this junk I have succeeded. This movie was just plain stupid. Stupid because every element of the train runaway and chase was removed from the real world of trains. Even someone that knows little about the railroad should see this. The most glaring example was the attempt to stop the train with the pair of engines out in front. This engineer slowed until he was into the runaway train and then instead of staying against it, kept pulling away and then slamming back against it. This scene alone should insult the intelligence of any fifth grader. So just skip it.

This would be a PERFECT movie for Mystery Science 3000. 30 seconds into the film I was squirming in my seat from the unrealistic dialog and scenarios. I've totally lost respect for Denzel Washington as an actor appearing in such a piece of trash.

From what I can remember of the hard to believe scenes of the film: 1) A young, female, African American is the head yard master. Sure, that's believable.

2) A small regional railroad has a yard master building jam packed with jumbo flat panel screens and elaborate hi-tech equipment. Was any research done on this film? 3) Only a passing mention of the "dead mans" device in the locomotive? A device that would bring the locomotive to a halt in seconds regardless of whether the loco had its air supply connected to the rest of the train.

4) The train making the turn at high speed and lifting off the side of one rail at a sever angle, then plopping right down on the track again. At this point I felt like I was watching an animation.

5) News helicopters at a 45 degree angle inches away from the train (on both sides!), going 70 miles an hour. Sure. Happens all the time.

6) What on earth did the fact that the daughters working at Hooters have to do with anything in the film? Maybe a little ad placement, eh? What amazes me the most about all of this is that so many people gave this relatively high ratings. I don't understand how anyone could watch this and not see the absurdity in it.

Saw this last night in a suburban London cinema where, to the film's credit, it was unusually a full house. Then the opening titles rolled, and that's it for the positives.

Now being a bit knowledgeable about the rail side of things, I'll just leave all the impossible aspects to one side. All I will say is that all the professionals in the industry will cringe on seeing this.

I suppose the overriding impression is that both editor and continuity must have been out to lunch instead of attending to their tasks. Claimed speeds completely different to what the film was showing, and so on. If railroads were run by people with such a lack of ability or attention to detail there would be train wrecks every day. News helicopters shown flying so close to the train, and to each other, and performing aerial stunts as if they were at an air show; they would have immediately crashed.

The way in which vast numbers of emergency, law enforcement and television news crews were all rustled up in minutes all along the tracks just looks beyond belief. The extras bill must have been most of the movie's budget.

Then there's the direction nonsenses. In attempting to deliberately derail the train, being right next to the tracks there would be the last place you would want to be. And yet a whole line of police cruisers were parked feet from the tracks. They were of course all destroyed. Meanwhile our hero in the pickup truck chasing the train is "assisted" by a yet more police cars following over rough ground, one of which spectacularly overturns just through stupid driving. This is meant to be a movie drama, not The Dukes of Hazzard.

It would not be much for me to say that above, having Denzel Washington re- teaming up with his frequent collaborator, director Tony Scott, on yet another movie involving a train very soon after last year's "Pelham 123". Comparisons, no matter how many people try to avoid it, is futile. One is always going to end up better than the other.

Fortunately, "Unstoppable" is better than "Pelham 1 2 3". The main reason is that while "Pelham" works as more of a crime thriller, "Unstoppable" like the title suggests, is an action film. It has exhilarating action sequences laced with heart-stopping suspense and white-knuckle thrills the moment that train is let loose. It is cliché to say it, but it's terrific edge-of-your-seat entertainment. For those who are short on thrills after bland after-summer borefests (here's looking at you, "Takers"), this movie is for you.

Is it going to win any Oscars? With a movie like this? No, of course not. This isn't "There Will Be Blood". It's not exactly intelligent, but it is mostly believable. Inspired by true story, writer Mark Bomback's ("Live Free or Die Hard") script is fueled on one simple, very basic premise - a runaway train of doom (complete with highly toxic and explosive material packed in the last of its carriages). There are no human villains, just human heroics, stupidity and carelessness, plus a speeding and out of control giant bullet that can cause certain doom for many people. Those human qualities are what gives this film a realistic and believable edge.

The heroes are just everyday guys like you and me - Denzel Washington especially proves himself adaptable to every role assigned to him; in fact you can say that Washington plays himself in many his films, with that friendly smile and gentleman-like charm. He is tense, and worried when the role requires him to, and you feel for him and root for his character all the way.

But Washington is not alone in trying to stop this missile-on-wheels. Chris Pine here shows star power, and he has many heroic moments. I'm not saying that all looks, no substance. The guy shows, like Denzel, emotions when he needs to. The chemistry between him and Denzel is great, the buddy moments were there as well.

Both of them are the two main characters, but others are busy trying to stop this giant behemoth (most to useless effects). Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn and Lew Temple all give solid supporting performances as they try to stop the train at all costs.

Yes, the script could use some reworking, especially in the cliché- filled dramatic parts, but Mark Bomback's script is ultimately an extended chase sequence that doesn't relent the moment it starts. The aforementioned dramatic moments take place during the action, so the film's pace is about as tight as a bullet. It's short, simple (we're talking bare-bones simple here, don't expect any hidden meanings to be unfurled like the vastly superior "Runaway Train" by Andrei Konchalovsky), and straight to the point. And perhaps that is why "Unstoppable" works - it has a very nice touch of simplicity, with an easy to understand plot and like-able, everyday guys who have no choice but to save the day before pandemonium breaks out.

Technical wise, it is outstanding. All of the films action sequences are filmed with REAL trains and REAL destruction and mayhem, making it perfect eye candy for action junkies drained of an adrenaline rush. Twisted metal and explosions are (almost) always a joy to watch, ESPECIALLY if they are real - but in this film some may cringe with the action sequences, knowing that it may destroy a town - the danger is there. Not a tinge of CGI (perhaps only the sparks?) is seen throughout the film. The production design - the setting of the film which takes place in rural Pennsylvania, is calm, serene and kind of homely (most of the film is set outdoors, for obvious reasons). The cinematography, thankfully, is bright, lively, and crisp - thus allowing the audience to see the scenery as well as the action sequences in all their glory - the shaky-cam is sparingly used, and even so, you can still see what's going on as the shaky-cam is used from a distance. The editing is also very fluid, Chris Lebenzon has definitely learned and improved from his dizzying and messy hatchet job on "Pelham", but this is also due to the intervening of other editor Robert Duffy, a frequent collaborator of avant-garde filmmaker Tarsem Singh. Frequent Scott collaborator Harry Gregson-Williams also composes a tense, if not unoriginal, orchestral score that gives tension to scenes when it needs it.

Last but not least, director Tony Scott himself. Here is a man who knows how to make an action film. Having made many action films for nearly three decades, age has certainly done nothing to slow his signature style down. The direction is kinetic and focused, and Scott delivers the action goods in spades. I think, due to the friendship and frequent collaboration with Denzel Washington (this film marks their fifth collaboration overall) that Scott continues to be an in-demand action film director, and this film contributes to that winning streak. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Take this - anybody can describe the film's plot in just two words: runaway train. If people want to see a movie about a runaway train, they certainly got it in the form of this film. It's what they pay for. See it with friends, especially in a big theater hall with a nice sound system. Glad to see a movie that works entirely without flashy CGI and 3D visuals, and still manages to be a terrificly entertaining crowd- pleaser.

Overall rating: 70/100 (Good)

Edit: R.I.P. Tony. Such a shocking end to a marvelously kinetic career. You and your films will be missed. Condolences to Ridley and the Scott family.

I was shocked to see IMDb users rating this film around 7. I figured it'd be closer to 5. Sad, sad, sad.

My friend and I were 10 minutes into the movie when we already knew the outcome. This movie is a silly joke about an unmanned train, and nothing along the way is a surprise.

The dialog is bland, the characters are not compelling, and nothing drew us in.

Way too predictable. 

In the end you'll realize this is an hour and 40 minutes of your life that you can't get back.

Everything with this film starts and ends with the writing, it's terrible, but it just goes downhill from there.

There are no spoilers in this review, only life savers... time savers. 

The one climactic point in this film is when the train has to slow down to 15 mph or it'll derail into some fuel tanks. You tell me, was there ever any doubt the train wouldn't crash? 

If there were an ounce of originality in this film, something unforeseen would have happened, and it didn't. 

Sometimes after films are over, my friend and I get into pretty good discussions. We discussed Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive for a long time and still talk about them occasionally. This is about how our conversation went after Unstoppable:

What would you rate this film? I said 4. He said, "Out of 5?". No, 10. "Really? I'd give it a 1". I said, well, I personally think it's 1- star, but it's an action- film with Denzel and if I were a movie critic I'd give it a 4 just because some may find it entertaining. 

He said, anyone who appreciates films won't find it entertaining and those of you who save your time and money by avoiding this film can thank us for wasting our time for you.

And now ladies and gentlemen, we have the gripping story of a runaway train and the many valiant attempts to stop it. In order to impress upon us the urgency and turbulence of the developing situation, our director has seen fit to keep the camera moving in a distractingly hyperactive fashion, be it a quiet personal confrontation between characters or overloud footage of the train bowling along at speed. Among the jerky hand-held, constantly-moving camera-work is one technique which wore me down very quickly indeed, and that was the quick, rough zoom I have termed the 'gawk'. Once established, the 'gawk' is a constant companion throughout 'Unstoppable', just like an annoyingly bored and sugar-primed kid next to you on a long bus trip. The movie's characters are but ciphers, with Denzel Washington (obviously now in 'money, dear boy' mode) as the best-known face. The would-be trainstoppers are a pretty lame bunch, but then how can mere humans stop something so determined to wreak havoc? The iron behemoth known as '777' (one worse than 666?) puts itself into gear, takes off with an audible moan, and proceeds to charge through the countryside laying waste. It growls bestially, travels at whatever speed it damn well feels like, and acts downright malevolently any time anyone tries to shut it down. Apparently 'Unstoppable' has been in development hell since 2004, and frankly it looks like it's been there since 1984. The CGI is brief, but rest assured it looks like it was done at 3 AM after a long cocktail evening. 'Unstoppable' is basically 'Christine' with a train, but shh; you didn't hear that from the director All it would have taken is some expository dialogue about how 777 fell over at the factory and killed three workmen and we would be away. Yet despite so much evidence to the contrary, we were evidently meant to accept the story as non-supernatural. Add to this several ridiculously stupid (the cops shooting at the train, driving in Blues Brother fashion, etc.) and physically impossible moments and you have a movie which doesn't work even if you do turn your brain off. All in all though, we did have a good time poking fun at this the other day, and in closing let it be said that believing in a malevolent train is not far down the road from accepting that both of Denzel's character's rather modestly endowed daughters work at Hooters.

As the son of a train driver I could list at least 10 plausible, simple solutions to the problem of the "Runaway Train", that were apparently not considered by the people who produced this film. Had they considered a more logical solution, it would have been a 10 minute movie, and they would have recognized that such a short story would be implausible for mainstream audiences and had to find another subject. Instead, they persisted... tragically.

Unable to find anything likable about any of the characters, I found myself barracking for the train itself, hoping that it would rid the world of a few hundred thousand morons. It did not. The train was the "bad guy" and it had to be stopped, even if that meant organizing an entire squad of riflemen trying to shoot the train, a veteran soldier from Afghanistan swinging from a rope from a helicopter, and a futile derailment setup that looked as though it was made of plastic.

This movie is comparable to the likes of "2012" in its ability to brutally offend the eyes, ears and rational sensibility of any viewer with a true appreciation of quality film-making. It is a pitiful indication of the lengths that Hollywood will go to in an attempt to achieve mediocrity.

To very existence of this kind of horse sh_t is an insult to train drivers. Hell, it's an insult to trains! Millions of dollars were spent on this impotent garbage, and for what? What did it contribute to the art of film-making? Nothing! Washington, and director Tony Scott need to be ashamed of themselves for lowering themselves to this level. Ashamed as I am of myself for having sat through the stupid thing!

There seemed to be a potential for a good action thriller here such as "Speed", and seemed to be off to a good start. The first act of this film smartly eases into the dilemma, but uses every cliché in the book to pad out the story. I am sure that this Tony Scott product depicts the story "inspired by true events" down to the last detail (to laugh). It is not even 5 minutes into the movie and a bunch of school children are tossed in front of the runaway train. Both lead actors Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are given little to work with. Denzel is a by-the-book train engineer, Pine is a rookie learning the ropes. Their family side stories are fleeting and lack any gravitas. Cue the tracking shots. My god the tracking shots. Tony, please, by making your tracking shots faster and more frequent, you don't automatically make your movie any better. Literally every line of dialogue seems to be a tracking shot. The same tracking shot of Chris Pine's close-up. Again and again and again. I had to look away. I was getting nauseous like I do from the "Paul Greengrass" effect.

Contrary to the the line in the opening credits, the screenplay feels uninspired. There are ham-handed digs at corporate insensitivity. TV reporters are continuously providing spoon-fed exposition in a way that would insult six-year-olds. And just in case you don't a get enough of the "Fox News" graphics in the corner of every TV report, there is a blatant full blown FOX NEWS ADVERTISEMENT thrown in. And geez, what's with the constant helicopter action shots? Do you have to throw two news helicopters in EVERY SINGLE CUT? Every single angle? Every close-up, medium, wide? Please please please have someone like your brother tell you about the value of LESS IS MORE. In other words, you will care more about the characters if you don't put them in cartoonish moments of conflict.

Minor Spoilers ahead...

A train being driven by Denzel and Pine must move to a side track to get out of the way of the oncoming runaway train. The runaway roars down the main track and slams into the other train with about 10 cars still on the main track. By all logic, the 10 cars going the opposite direction should stop or at least derail the runaway train, but the runaway seems to only smash through a single railroad car and go along unimpeded. One ridiculous threat of danger is the "Stanton Turn", an obvious bit of CGI where big obvious fuel storage tanks are neatly lined along the most dangerous point of the curve. With no safety embankments or anything. But of course, Tony Scott has to push it to another laughable extreme where the entire town of people (wait - weren't they supposed to be evacuated?), emergency vehicles, and a slew of reporters are STANDING DIRECTLY BELOW THE DANGEROUS CURVE. Come on, you stop feeling a sense of danger when you turn it into a Road Runner cartoon.

Minor Spoilers finished...

A much better film is "Runaway Train" with Jon Voigt and Eric Roberts. Voigt gives a performance of a lifetime, and Andrey Konchalovsky creates a far more powerful sense of danger and excitement. And please don't fall for the "inspired by real events". Although the basic elements of the story were based on a real incident in Ohio in 2001, the train never reached 70mph, and there never was a dead man's curve. Like the awful "Taking of Pelham One. Two, Three", Scott makes the mistake of remaking a film without improving it. This makes it no better than a TV movie (in fact "Taking of Pelham" was previously a TV movie). I laughed out loud when a seriously infantile piece of animation depicted the imminent disaster (again for those born without a brain) in "Unstoppable" just a few moments before the big climax. Perhaps one could defend this approach to filmmaking as being a roller coaster ride, not serious cinema. I would disagree, because you still get thrill of danger on a real roller coaster. This movie is the kiddie merry-go-round.

While the first half of the movie was good , it had a good buildup , the characters we're properly introduced , and the first suspense scenes we're pulled off quite nicely , the last 40 min of the movie i found to be a disaster .

Don't get me wrong the fast action sequences with the moving trains we're shot quite nicely , the problem lies with the script of the movie , the same pathetic line used 10 times , with a few variations to it . Not to mention that the only way the director of the movie thought to create suspense was by showing to the viewer the desperation on peoples faces in praying positions and muttering some desperate words . Seriously who would buy in to such crap ? Not to mention the cliché of the entire situation and one dimensional characters , greedy corporation guys and the guys on the trains not giving a damn if they live or die .

Instead of finding this movie suspenseful i found it ridiculous. Granted that the movie was based on "real facts" i would be insulted by this , another Hollywood garbage, that was lucky enough to have a star like Denzel Washington , great actor , just awful direction and script in this movie to work with.

For a long time i have been interested in movies, and got inspired by them and other stuff, but of course there is movies that is not good, bad movies and a example "Unstoppable" Plot: A train is on the run... with chemicals, are going in a big speed, and is about to blow up a town, and know one can stop it, except for Denzel Washinton And Chris Pine.

The plot is easy, nothing special, i did't find the plot special, not even close to special.

Tony Scott is of course not a bad directer, he have done some good movies, but more bad, but i stick to his brother Ridley Scott's movies instead, like Gladiator, Alien. I think Tonys best movie could be "Man on Fire" and The Taking of Pelham 1.2.3, those movies are good Tony Scott movies, but they others are not good.

Like always Denzel Wasington stars in a Tony Scott movie, but he surprise me of his not interesting performance, i were very disappointed at his performance actually, nothing good with it, but then we come to Chris Pine..... Awful, i really meen it, Awful!!! hes performance can maybe classes as one of the worst i have ever seen, and actually i think that hes performance is the one that makes this movie very not good.

Of curse this is't the worst, there is something that makes this movie a little bit better and it is the sound effects(Oscar-Nominated for) they are actually impressing, but that is the only thing, otherwise this is a bad movie, and i cant really recommend, but if you like Tony Scotts movies, then you maybe will enjoy it.

But in my opinion This is not a good movie 4/10 stars.

Several reviewers have already mentioned the believability problems, suspension of belief in the ridiculous premises etc..., but I will summarize:

-get manned train in front of train. Of course then all you have to do is jump from manned train to unmanned train using the end platforms. You don't need to (senselessly and dangerously) helicopter a driver on board from overhead- duh- but this is Hollywood!

-if you really want to derail a train you take apart the tracks - duh! 

-miraculously, the helicopters can fly at below treetop level nearly the entire time, with multiple camera angles available so we can somehow believe that all the concerned relatives and general public can look at whatever TV they are near and instantly experience all the same views the movie viewer sees.

-Train driver has to ask traffic control exactly where they are and how far to go!? Um no- train drivers know every inch of track on a line they frequent and know better anyways exactly where they are because - duh- they are actually there and not looking at a computer display miles away!

-Train is finally stopped because injured guy who was actually on train miraculously jumps off (with a just mangled foot) into bed of pickup, and then miraculously jumps back on with further mangled foot (he did groan in convincing agony after first jump) as pickup driver matches speed from thousands of feet of miraculously occurring parallel pavement. like - duh? they didn't have plenty of earlier opportunity to execute this maneuver before with an unmangled foot guy?

Miraculous media TV footage provided by "Fox News" so there's a clue as to the base audience intellect this "film" is targeted towards. I've just skimmed the surface here, there's much more. It's endlessly insulting throughout- "Unstoppable" you might say, and I really can't waste anymore time on this- you shouldn't either. Unless you're a major Denzel fan. He WAS very good.

I am a retired locomotive engineer of 39 years and I have run both passenger trains and freight trains.The things I saw in this movie led me to believe that they had zero technical advisers.At the beginning of the movie,the engineer gets off moving equipment(the locomotive)to throw a switch.However,the switch was lined for him already.How could that not have been caught?Then,during the chase,Denzel Washington keeps referring to the independent brake,but Chris Pine is actually using the automatic brake,another bad error in facts that easily could have been avoided.And,then,Denzel walking on top of a freight train going 60 mph putting hand brakes on would be impossible. It was just one unbelievable thing after another. I guess it makes for excitement,but someone with any knowledge of the railroad,this is a total joke

I was expecting at least an interesting "blockbuster movie experience" but this film ended up with mostly the wise old codger (Denzel) proving over and over how experienced he was with the young buck (Pine) learning that maybe he didn't know it all along the way, snore. The corporate types are shown as idiots, of course, and there are constantly multiple helicopters flying about 6 feet away from the train and each other, both of those are totally believable. Even how it starts is ridiculous. Disconnect the brakes, put the engine at full throttle, jump out and then don't tell anyone or ask for help until is it long gone that this might be a little teeny weeny problem. You almost knew to the second what was going to happen when, including the train just barely hanging on in the treacherous curve that they had been talking about for almost the entire movie. You even that it would go up on two wheels in that scene before it happened. WAY too many lame attempts to (unsuccessfully) generate drama and suspense. Fuel storage tanks surrounding the dangerous curve? Sure, why not? I am disappointed that they didn't put a nuclear power plant there with a big target for the most vulnerable spot to hit with a train. I also agree with other reviewers that I have never seen hundreds of cops show up and make so many road blocks nearly instantaneously in the middle of nowhere like that, they didn't need to show a dozen of them for the movie. Believe it or not, showing a roadblock as a train goes by is NOT that exciting, Tony Scott. If you want to have your intelligence insulted by an action movie with very little actual excitement, then this is your ticket.

This is an excellent movie in almost all respects. The cast does a very good job. The two leads play off of each other very well together and project good chemistry. The supporting cast is good as well and the movie even does a good job with providing some character depth (to the extent you can in this type of movie)- you do wind up rooting for them. The director has taken a good story, and matched it with excellent, I mean excellent, cinematography and takes us an every faster roller coaster ride. The movie is well paced, it keeps you engaged from the start & doesn't let you go until its over, and was just a lot of fun to watch. I highly recommend it.

In Pennsylvania, one engineer is maneuvering a train in the yard and accidentally leaves the train operating without the pneumatic brakes engaged. The operation department initially believes it is a coaster but soon the operators realize that the unmanned train is running on full power. Further, it is carrying dangerous chemicals and diesel in the cargo wagons. There are many unsuccessful attempts to stop the runaway train and the veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and the young conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) decide to take the chance to reduce the speed of the train with the most unlikely operation.

The farewell of the brilliant director Tony Scott is a thriller with non- stop action inspired in a true event in Ohio. The screenplay is engaging and the dramatization is adequate to the story. The great cast with Denzel Washington, Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson completes this excellent entertainment. My vote is seven.

This is worse than the film "Speed" with Keanu Reeves who starred in it. "Unstoppable", about a train that is unable to be stopped - big wow. The funniest thing is, there were several attempts to get someone to jump onto the train from a helicopter and failed. Come on, it's not exactly difficult, and that's all it would take to stop the train.

Whether it had plenty of decent and well-known actors in it or not, it still wouldn't of made the film any good. The entire "plot" was boring. It was about a runaway train that had to be stopped - nothing else, not even a slight sign of romance. Comedy? Definitely not.

Dull and boring is what the title should be. Film is stupid and should never of been made.
