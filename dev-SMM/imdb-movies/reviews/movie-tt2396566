### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
This is a documentary of the background singers we've been listening to for decades. People whose singing we actually sing or hum to without ever knowing who they are. They work in the studios and live on stage with The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Sting, and many, many others. That magic that works in the studio or on stage as background singers is undeniable but may not necessarily be there for them when they try to branch out on their own as a lead singer. They are talented for sure and many songs wouldn't sound anything like they do without back up singers.

The documentary is good however, something is missing. Who actually calls the singers for a gig? Who actually pays them? How are they paid? By the hour? By the session? How did they get started? Where was their first gig? None of this spoken of and there is a sense that perhaps the interviewers were told that they shouldn't dig too, too deep. 

Not bad but left me wanting more.

This movie is not well researched. Straight to the point, Darlene Love did not sing the Da Doo Ron Ron nor did she sing background on it. She did not sing background for any Crystal song. Her credits are "He's A Rebel" and "He's Sure The Boy I Love". That is it. La La Brooks is the one and only original singer of the DDRR. La La's management contacted Morgan Neville and informed him of this. Morgan Neville apologized to La La Brooks. He feels Darlene pulled one on him and is further annoyed that he had to pay for the rights to the DDRR. Phil Spector has stated twice in 2012 and 2013 that Darlene had nothing to do with the DDRR. At the time of the DDRR being produced, Darlene Love was at home tending to her first born son. The background singers to the DDRR are Cher, Fanita James and Gracia Nitzsche.

I forgot to mention that Darlene Love and The Blossoms take credit for singing background on the Shoop, Shoop Song in this movie. This is not true. The hit song, SSS, was sung by Betty Everett and The Opals were the background singers. The record was produced by VJ Records of Chicago. The Blossoms sang background on Merry Clayton's version of the SSS, and this record was a flop. The Blossoms sang background on Aretha Franklin's cover of the SSS on Shindig. No record was produced for this.

Further the name of the group - is The Blossoms. It is not Darlene Love and The Blossoms. The Blossoms were created by Fanita (Edwards) James in 1954. Darlene didn't come along until the year 1958.

Greetings again from the darkness. "And the colored girls go do doo doo, do doo ...". The controversial lyrics from Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side" kick off this exceptional documentary about the oft-ignored back-up singers who have played (and continue to play) a huge role in some of the biggest songs of all-time. You may not know their names, but you have undoubtedly sung along with them while driving or taking a shower.

Director Morgan Neville has a credit list filled with music shorts and documentaries. One of my personal favorites of his is The American Masters on Muddy Waters. I recalled that while watching this one because Neville does a nice job of connecting the dots from Gospel, Blues and Soul to the roots of Rock and Roll. The main women featured here all admit to being daughters of preachers, and fine-tuning their ability to harmonize during their youth while singing in the church choir.

Most of the interview time and insight comes from Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, and Merry Clayton. You may not recognize the names or faces, but you will surely recognize the voices. Ms. Love has been elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and may be best known thanks to her annual appearance on the David Letterman Show at Christmas. Ms. Fischer is the most frequent worker today of the three as she tours with Chris Botti, Sting and The Rolling Stones. However, the heart-stopping climax of the film belongs to Merry Clayton, as we are treated to her isolated vocals from the master on her infamous performance on the single "Gimme Shelter". Hearing her raw voice blast out "Rape. Murder. It's just a shot away" is both exhilarating and gut-wrenching. To hear her tell the story is mesmerizing. One of my favorite movie moments ever.

While we see and hear the personal stories filled with frustration and regrets, we also see an inherent love of music and the appreciation for their particular gift. We also hear from Tata Vega, Dr. Mabel John (a former Raelette for Ray Charles), and Claudia Lennear. With many similar stories of their quest for solo careers, we get the contemporary version with Judith Hill, a twenty-something working back-up today as she strives for a solo career. The parallels are obvious with her older peers.

Another excellent feature of the film comes in the form of interviews from the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Lou Adler, Chris Botti, and Mick Jagger. We also see some studio shots featuring Phil Spector (once the hottest music producer, now incarcerated), and concert footage of Talking Heads, Ray Charles, The Rolling Stones, and the Concert for Bangladesh. It's especially fitting to see Luther Vandross as a back-up singer to David Bowie's "Young Americans", and to hear from Sheryl Crow, who worked as Michael Jackson's back-up/lead female. These are the examples of the back-ups who successfully made the walk.

My only minor quibble with the film is structural, not content. Neville has an over-whelming task of addressing each of the individual stories, while also relating it to the nasty and unfair music business, the Civil Rights movement, the development of Rock and Roll, and the role that "talent" plays in what Springsteen terms the "complicated" walk from back-up to lead singer (the titular 20 feet). The segment focusing on Merry Clayton's role in Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" is especially poignant. Overall this film is fascinating and entertaining, and makes a great companion piece to Standing in the Shadows of Motown (2002) and Muscle Shoals (2013).

I had a seat for a screening of this documentary in London, and with all the publicity I was really looking forward to seeing it.

This film takes a good look back over the contemporary music scene from the point of view of the backing vocalists who give some inspiring performances on camera. The performance side of things comes over very well in the documentary and initially one can feel grateful to the director, Morgan Neville, for getting everyone together.

However, I know my girl groups from the 1960's really well and it wasn't long before I could sense that something was up with the narrative account given by Darlene Love in the documentary.

Not having paid much attention to Darlene Love over the years, I was amazed to find her whining on camera about making records for Phil Spector but having the credit go instead to the Crystals. That's very misleading, so it is a mystery why it was included at all in the edit.

For a start, the Crystal's were an accomplished vocal group who sang on their own records and they had quite a number of their singles reach the charts.

Darlene Love was apparently hired by Spector to record two tracks which he decided to release and promote under the name of the Crystals. That was his choice. For Darlene Love this was just some paid session work, despite her hopes being raised after He's A Rebel had charted.

Meanwhile La La Brooks age only 15 was laying down the vocals on Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me. These were both massive hits for the real Crystals.

So why is Darlene Love reunited on screen with the Blossoms to reprise Da Doo Ron Ron? That's another mystery as neither Darlene Love nor the Blossoms sang on the original hit record. Seems to me that she wants it both ways.

By now I am feeling unhappy with the documentary, with the succession of over the top vocal performances contrasting with the hard-life tales which may turn out to be rather loose accounts if Darlene Love's personal 'recollections' are anything to go by.

At the finish I am supposed to feel overwhelmed by the experience, but in reality I am less well inclined towards Morgan Neville for making a glossy side show from these people's talent.

Disappointed. Genuinely so,

This documentary is another in a recent cycle that looks at those from the music industry who have been neglected in some way. In 'A Band Called Death' we learn about an innovative proto-punk band who never even got a chance to record an album and were only rediscovered over 35 years after recording their demo tapes, in 'Anvil: the Story of Anvil' we follow a band who have maintained a very mediocre level of success over a very long time and in' Searching for Sugarman' we are given the incredible story about a musician who released a couple of records that no one bought and who vanished without a trace for quarter of a century. The angle that '20 Feet from Stardom' is coming from is very similar but with a twist  this is the story of neglected musicians who are in actual fact the voices of the sounds that have been in ours heads our whole lives.

It centres on a selection of classy African American female backup singers who recorded vocal accompaniments for a series of stars from the 60's to the present day. While they were essentially voices for hire, often it was their vocals that made the songs so good  listen to David Bowie's 'Young Americans' and tell me that it's the backing vocals that aren't the best part. But the story has a sadness, as these incredible singers rarely got beyond the backup part of the act. Sometimes they tried and their career stalled. This was because being a successful solo artist requires so many variables such as songs, charisma and determination. While it also needs the marketing powers of the record label. All these ingredients are not necessarily a given for someone with a beautiful voice. However, in some cases actual exploitation seems to have occurred as in the case of Darlene Love, who was used by producer Phil Spector as the voice that the girl group The Crystals claimed as their own but even more unforgivably, Spector got Love to record a track promising it was going to go out under her name only to surreptitiously give it to The Crystals again.

The film uses a talking heads format, with contributions from a variety of stars that used backup singers such as Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen and Sting. There is also priceless archive footage of the likes of Ray Charles and, best of all, Ike and Tina Turner. Sometimes we even get to deconstruct a famous song to hone in on the backup vocals, such as in the case of the track 'Gimme Shelter' which is very possibly the best song the Rolling Stones ever recorded. We hear the backup vocal in all its isolated glory and it becomes very obvious that without it, this song would simply be nowhere near as powerful. So, let's hear it for those unheralded women who have filled our heads with such beautiful sounds all these years. This is their moment of recognition and they deserve it.

There are some people who toil anonymously in the music business: session musicians, recording engineers, producers and so on. And then there are the backup singers. Many of those, probably most dream of being out front, becoming a star, and gaining worldwide fame, applause, respect.

For most, it doesn't happen. Once in a while somebody breaks through: Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Elton John, Barry Manilow, Sheryl Crowe, Phil Collins. More often, it's a day job, and they are called for sessions, sing their part and go home. Sometimes they will be a permanent part of the act, like the Raylettes with Ray Charles, but they don't get the big rewards the upfront star does.

Such is the story of "20 Feet From Stardom", where we meet a half dozen or more who have had a career in the back light, occasionally getting the break to record their own album, and then ... nothing. Darlene Love was the voice of the Crystals, except Phil Spector kept slapping somebody else's name on her recordings and she got nothing. (She ended up cleaning houses for a living. But two years ago, in much belated recognition, she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.) Merry Clayton is another; she's the haunting female lead on the Stones "Gimme Shelter", but as a solo artist she just never took off.

It's a well constructed film, and if a bit indulgent here or there, it's just a matter of choice in the editing booth, not a failure of the director to deliver.

If you have any interest in the music industry, or have ever thought of a career as a singer, this is a great lesson on the realities of that business. (This would also apply to acting, where "That Guy" did a similar riff on that equally competitive business.

Of course it's worth noting that while there are lots of people "20 Feet from Stardom", there are legions more who never even get that close, and who wind up singing in saloons, street corners, and even subway stops. It's a tough world out there. "20 Feet From Stardom" picks a point closer to the pinnacle, but not quite, and that's what makes it interesting.

I had never heard of the performers, but have apparently enjoyed their contributions thousands of times. Praise to the producer and director for their headliner contributors. I saw the film at the Minneapolis - St Paul film festival. Merry Clayton came to the screening and sang for us after the showing. That girl still has the pipes. The story about her audition with the Rollings Stones was a hoot. The soundtrack is wonderful. Lisa Fischer has an amazing voice - blew my socks off. Hope the movie comes to a theater near me, so I can hear it again. I thought the director did a wonderful job of balancing the contributions of the headliners with the life stories of the singers. It was a treat to hear them do their thing out in the spotlight.

20 Feet from Stardom (2013)

**** (out of 4)

Whereas SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN was one of the best films of 2012, this year has another musical documentary that turns out to be a masterpiece. Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Lou Adler, Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler and Mick Jagger are just a few of the well-known singers who talk about some back-up singers who everyone will know from certain hit songs yet it's highly unlikely that you'll know their names. Merry Clayton, Darlene Love, Claudia Lennear, Lisa Fischer, Tata Vega and Judith Hill get their shot in the spotlight as they talk about why they are highly respected inside the business yet they never managed to become "stars" or lead singers on their own. Some of their reasons include them not wanting to but there are some darker ones dealing with race as well as Phil Spector simply hiding one from being famous. 20 FEET FROM STARDOM is a masterpiece in regards to music documentaries and it ranks right up there with some of the greatest ever made. It was rather amazing sitting back and hearing these stories and when you realize some of the music that these women have been involved with you certainly see why so many sing their praises. This includes Clayton who was pregnant and wearing rollers in her hair when she got a phone call in the middle of the night to help The Rolling Stones with what would become the chorus for Gimme Shelter. The film is full of wonderful and touching stories dealing with either high praise or simply hard luck. The fact that so many great songs are so memorable because of something that background singers are doing is a subject that seems to be long overdue. This film certainly makes it a very fascinating subject and it makes you wonder how many others are out there just waiting to get some credit that they deserve. The film features some terrific music from all of the artists mentioned so music fans will have a blast hearing songs from the 50s up through the 90s. 20 FEET FROM STARDOM is certainly one of the best films of 2013.

At ninety one minutes it feels longer. While there is interesting archival footage the repeated talking head aspect from the top names in the music industry becomes tiresome. The message and plight of background singers message is not subtle. The movie stays in a mid range and lacks highs and lows.

Sting tells us to takes more then talent to reach star status. It was interesting to hear, not everyone wants the hassle that comes with stardom in the music industry. Phil Spector Is lucky he most likely won't see how he is depicted.

The archival footage is far superior to the "don't go to deep" interviews shot for the documentary. If you like music there is a enough here to enjoy. If you are expecting an in depth exposé of the industry it's twenty feet short.

This film is highly recommended.

Midway through Morgan Neville's riveting new documentary about the world of backup singers, Twenty Feet from Stardom, music legend Sting comments that the most important factors needed for success, more so than talent, are luck and timing. That sage comment is the crux of this thoroughly entertaining film.

We meet a series of talented vocalists, mostly unknowns who contributed to many hit recordings of the past (songs like Gimme Shelter, Walk on the Wild Side, Young Americans, What'd I Say, and Sweet Home Alabama). We learn about their journey for fame and fortune and its high cost. Many edge their way toward the spotlight only to somehow lose sight of that elusive goal. Twenty Feet from Stardom honestly tells their life stories. Most end unhappily, some are more fortunate. All are thoroughly engrossing studies of blind ambition (or in some cases, the lack thereof) and the singer's personal need to share their vocal gift with others.

These background singers are a remarkable bunch of gifted performers, many of which go unrecognized by the general public, including myself. Names like Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill, the Waters Family, Claudia Lennear, Mabel John, Stevvi Alexander, Jo Lawry, and Tata Vega are bantered about. We witness these gifted women and their incredible high- reaching vocal range. This documentary gives the moviegoer a front row seat. It's must-see viewing.

Their individual journeys are fascinating and varied. We learn that some of these session singers leave the music industry to start other careers while others still languish in the music business waiting for their next gig. One singer ends up posing for Playboy while another finds a religious calling. One even wins a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Artist for her debut album, only to find that her fame evaporate until her next recording. Probably the best known of these talents is Darlene Love who tells her tragic tale of the Svengali-like Phil Spector and his malicious control over her career. (Love poignantly admits that watching other performers lip-syncing to her voice and losing her musical identity in the process became too much for her to handle. We then actually see the footage of that act in question.) 

Sometimes the film overstates its message and becomes a bit redundant. But the filmmakers have culled extraordinary performances, both then and now. Neville builds his story with rare archival footage of these singers in performances from the sixties to present day and he masterfully incorporates strong imagery throughout the many interviews with established stars like Bruce Springstein, Stevie Wonder, Patti Austin, Chris Botti, Bette Midler, Mike Jagger, and the aforementioned Sting. These stars truly appreciate the genuine talent of these women and the musical contributions they bought to their mega-recordings. 

Twenty Feet from Stardom creates a visual and auditory record of these great soul singers and may help them one day gain the recognition they deserve. Let's hope filmmaker Neville doesn't need luck and timing on his side either until his next film. He is a real talent to watch and his film is a joy to be heard. (I will eagerly wait for the soundtrack.) GRADE: B+

I didn't see 20 FEET FROM STARDOM in the theater because I thought it would be just a lame VH-1 type doc. And guess what, it is! I finally saw it because it has such Oscar buzz. It's ultimately an unfocused mess. Nice to see so many talented "background" singers but the film can't contain itself when it comes to fame and the big time. Why is that the focus? Is fame the only reward? The singers in the film continually tell us it is not but the filmmakers cannot stay clear of the topic. And why delve into the topic with great producer like Lou Adler who appears in the film. He knows that talent is not what drives success. Some of the least talented people have had massive careers in pop music and some of them are even in this film!

These women deserve to be celebrated for what they brought to music. The film does this but then it veers all over the place. Imagine a deep analysis of GIMME SHELTER and what that song would be like without the masterful female background vocals. 

20 FEET is just a big nothing. These women deserve better!

I watched this movie last night and enjoyed it. This morning I came to write a glowing review, but I decided to read a few other reviews first. Imagine my shock when I saw several informed reviews criticizing the film for its blatant fabrication of facts. So I paused to do some research on my own.

The worst fudging seems to be regarding the career of Darlene Love which, to me was the most interesting part of the documentary. It's interesting because Darlene makes the claim, backed by documentarian Morgan Neville, that Darlene was the real lead singer on several songs which ended up being credited to other artists. It blames Phil Spector (you know, the guy who is currently serving 19 years for 2nd degree murder of actress Lana Clarkson) for maliciously manipulating Darlene Love and tricking her with promises of a solo career but instead crediting other singers for Darlene's work. Journalists were unable or unwilling to reach Phil Spector in prison to check facts; the world would much sooner believe a poor victimized singer who is forced to clean houses for a living than a rich & powerful murderer.

The truth is convoluted (if you're curious, there's a pretty credible analysis on songfacts.com, search for the song "Da Doo Ron Ron"). The official record stands that Darlene Love has since retracted her claim that she sang lead. Last year the NY Times issued a correction to its article which had praised this film, stating that Darlene Love did NOT sing "Da Doo Ron Ron", but maintained that Darlene sang backup on it. But the real truth is that Darlene's voice wasn't on that song at all. The backup singers were Fanita James, Gracia Nitzsche & Cher.

There's more, but you probably get the point. Not only is this documentary inaccurate, it may be deliberately fraudulent for the sake of weaving an underdog story that never was. It's really sad that the film screwed up on that account, because there's plenty of other things it could have focused on instead of claiming that these singers were cruelly manipulated.

Like the far superior documentary "Standing in the Shadows of Motown", this film could have focused on the inspirational story of musicians who are simply proud that they helped make musical history--regardless of if they became superstars. In "Shadows" we don't get a weepy pity party for anyone; instead we get a triumphant revelation that the greatest session musicians were just ordinary Joes & Janes who never craved the spotlight. In "20 Feet From Stardom" we get conflicting messages: on one hand that the backup singers are content to remain in the background, on the other hand we get the picture that these backup singers were cheated out of stardom by sleazy producers. And lo & behold, those claims aren't even true.

So, like my title says, I feel horribly cheated and manipulated myself. I had come here ready to write a rave review of what I thought was a polished & informative documentary deserving of its Academy Award (make no mistake, the cinematography and intimate studio footage are excellent), but 10 minutes researching the truth showed me that this documentary can't be trusted.

Check out "Standing in the Shadows of Motown" instead. If you like other styles of music (like metal, for example) check out a wonderfully heartwarming & unintentionally hilarious documentary called "Anvil! The Story of Anvil". The music world is full of interesting stories without documentarians needing to manufacture them.

I watched this documentary, because it was nominated for an Oscar and was the favorite to win (which it eventually did). So I thought I'd give it a shot.

To be honest, I was rather disappointed. I was hoping to see a documentary about unknown background singers, who try to earn enough money, so that they can feed their families, who barely get jobs and live near poverty. It turns out to be about the successful background singers that have made it and have worked with very successful singers. Unfortunately, I did not really care for their "problem" that they are not the lead singer and do not get the fame.

When watching a documentary, I want one of two things (ideally both): 1) That the movie makes an impression on me. 2) That I learn something new that is interesting.

This documentary failed to do both (at least for me). In conclusion, that is why I do not think that it deserved an Oscar nomination, let alone a win.

15 minutes into 20 Feet from Stardom you really become excited about the possibilities. You hear familiar songs that are given a new perspective and see the faces that match the voices you fell in love with. But before the film winds down, you have more questions than you did going in. It devolves into little more than a well-produced message from the Music Industry Tourism Board. That's not to say there's no value here. It does provide a look at some significant voices with a top-line glance into their place in the recording industry and their personal journeys. There's enough here to engage you and ample servings of some truly outstanding music (the a cappella take of Merry Clayton's "Gimme Shelter" vocal gives you chills and the recollection of its recording session is one of the film's highlights). But it's narrow focus and limited perspective do leave a lot on the table.

The bulk of the film consists of five stories from the 1960s to the present, including Darlene Love (ghost singer for The Crystals on "He's a Rebel" and a featured performer on the greatest Christmas album of all time, A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector), Merry Clayton (the aforementioned backup on The Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" and actress from Cagney & Lacey), Tata Vega (The Color Purple soundtrack and numerous background gigs from the 80s to present), Lisa Fischer (Rolling Stones, Luther Vandross and Tina Turner collaborator and Grammy winning solo artist), and Judith Hill (Performed at Michael Jackson's memorial service and would go on to compete on season 4 of The Voice after the film's completion).

While both Tata Vega and Lisa Fisher seem to lack the resume of classic recordings that Love, Clayton or Claudia Lennear (another subject) have racked up, Judith Hill's inclusion is perhaps the most questionable. She seems to view the role of backup singer unbefitting her, going so far as to wear a wig when performing a backup gig on television so as not to be recognized by her fans. Having not amassed the body of work the other subjects have, she has little to contribute here except as a counterpoint to Lisa Fisher's humble demeanor or as a throw-in to represent the future of the industry. Unfortunately, she seems ill-suited to be a symbol or generational representative, as her scenes fail to accomplish this goal with any impact.

One of the issues I had coming into this movie as a music fan is that I was able to see the potential this kind of documentary had in mining the munificent history of Rock and Roll and Soul music. However, perhaps because of my own musical biases, I found the segments focusing on the music and voices of the 60s and 70s so much richer and more interesting. The film introduces big figures of the time like Phil Spector and Ike Turner but never explores the gory details of what it was like working with such notorious personalities. Indeed, one could have easily have scrapped anything 80s and upward and filled that time talking about the difficulties these women of colour faced from producers, record labels, and even the lead vocalists themselves, during some very turbulent times. Throw in some of the talented ladies from the George Clinton, Sly Stone and James Brown revues, or perhaps even a few of the fellas, and you have yourself a foundation for an insightful film.

The movie also fails to explore what it was like performing on some of the most famous recordings of our time and have little to show for it. Nothing is done to investigate whether these artists were fairly compensated. It was great that they were able to get Mick Jagger to sit down and talk about his backup singers, but it would have been interesting to ask him if he thought they had been properly remunerated for their work. Just a bit of a look into the mechanics of the industry in that regard would help us better understand what being in that occupation was like from a financial standpoint and what kind of life that affords.

At the end of the film's airy 90 minute running time, one does walk away with a new appreciation for the role of the backup singer (for at least the next little while) and perhaps that's all this documentary ever aspired to be. But an Oscar nominee should strive for something greater than that. While being entertaining, the film is hardly insightful and leaves one with the distinct impression of wanting more. Perhaps we can get a miniseries on this one day.

20 Feet from Stardom

The worst part of being a backup singer is you're in the path of the lead singer's farts.

Mind you, Mick Jagger would be the one emitting gas in this documentary.

In the shadow of the spotlight, women, like, Darlene Love, Merry Clayton and Sheryl Crow, have been overlooked in the annals of music history for their supporting role  until now.

From their inception due to breakouts within existing girl groups - The Supremes  to Caucasian rockers - Bruce Springsteen, Sting - who utilize African American singers to add credibility to their ditties, 20 Feet from Stardom explores every angle of this misunderstood contributor.

Through interviews with the backups themselves as well as the artists and producers they work with, viewers are treated to a fascinating account of the recording industry's true underdog.

And contrary to popular belief, backup singers weren't invented because Phil Spector might shoot the lead singer.

With a family friend paying a Christmas visit soon,I decided to search around for a music documentary that he see during the holiday period.Picking up an old copy of a UK film magazine called Empire,I spotted a review for what sounded like a fab tune of a documentary,which led to me getting ready to meet the people 20 feet away from stardom.

Outline of the documentary:

Starting off in the early days of popular music,the film shows artists to largely play everything safe in their live performances,with the singers & their back-up singers (both groups of which were mostly Caucasian) giving stiled,reserved performances.As the 60's arrived,the civil rights movement in America began to make its voice heard loud and clear,with Motown and other record labels giving African-American singers the chance to unleash their voice.Whilst the singers find themselves delighted over giving dozens of soon-to-be classic songs their winning hook and fiery sass,they each soon discover how hard it is to reach the front stage. 

View on the documentary:

Focusing a large section of the documentary on 60s Girl Groups, some of director Morgan Neville's interviewees sadly decide to take the opportunity to "re-write history", (or to put it in a more honest manner,lie!) with singer Darlene Love (whose comments in the interview led to Neville paying the rights for songs that Love did not perform on!) claiming that she performed on songs such as Da Doo Ron Ron & songs by The Crystals,with Love's Crystal "vocals" actually being those of Dolores La La Brooks.

Along with some of the interviews being a bit dodgy,Neville also takes an unexpectedly restrained approach to going into the full behind the scenes details into the making of the songs.Neville keeps away from revealing the business side of the music industry, (with the nearest that the film gets being 2 of the women saying that they had to get a second job,thanks to backing-vocal work drying up) and also avoiding any mention of the excesses displayed in the 60's/70's Rock scene.

Spreading an amazing soundtrack across the films 90 minute running time,Neville allows the music to shine bright like a diamond,as the soundtrack goes from pounding hard Rock to soaring melodies,with Neville displaying an amazing skill in tracking down rare solo recording of backing singers bringing now- famous songs bursting to life,with Ava Cherry, Robin Clark and Luther Vandross ripping the plastic from David Bowie's plastic Soul,and the still-pretty Merry Clayton giving a breath taking performance,which puts all of the unsung backing singers at the front of the stage.

"Twenty Feet from Stardom" is written and directed by Morgan Neville, who is not new to the genre at all. He has already worked on documentaries about Johnny Cash, Pearl Jam and Ray Charles to name only a few. Here, however, he takes a look at these who are not in the limelight: the background singers. It is a bit of an irony that his biggest success, namely an Academy Award win for Best Documentary, comes with putting the focus on these and not on the real superstars. I cannot say too much about how deserving this film was to win as I have not seen any of the other nominees, but I have seen Blackfish and it is quite a shame that this Orca-based documentary did not even get nominated.

I did not really like "20 Feet from Stardom". Most of it is very clichéd. They keep saying several times that you need a huge ego for a huge career and that they are maybe background singers as they lack that ego. However, from the way these ladies acted and talked, I did not have the impression at all that they weren't egoistic enough. They seemed actually to have a bigger ego than some of the stars they did the background for. Maybe it simply is that they are not talented enough? The upside of this documentary is that you hear some real quality songs and see some interesting artists in a bit of a behind the scenes documentary. I liked the Stones' performance of Gimme Shelter with a magnificent performance from the female singer and also the version of "Lean on Me" near the end. These two are not enough to save the film from mediocrity though. It is certainly not the ultimate background singer documentary I had hoped for.

The Phil Specter criticism part was probably intended as one of the emotionally sad highlight, but the way it was displayed with the look in her face and the music in the background was just so over the top as if a 1,000 people just died that it felt completely artificial and cringeworthy. Other than that, the majority of the film is uplifting despite them letting us know what a tough job they actually have. But all the ones interviewed have performed with absolute superstars, so my sympathy is kind of limited here. If there is an upper class of background singers, then it is those people shown int his documentary. What about the ones struggling even harder? Where are they? It just lost a lot of credibility for me because of that. I am sure they made good money and still they behaved like they got absolutely nothing.

The film also showed that it is actually possible to make it from background singer to "real" singer and I liked the "Lion King" reference as I quite adore the film. What I found strange is that this film somehow lets the audience think there are only black female background singers. With one or two exceptions, none of the many people in there were male or white. I don't know what Neville intended with limiting it to that one specific group and what his point was in doing that. I personally would have hoped for a more general film in terms of the history of background singers instead of the specific lives and fates of those interviewed. Sometimes it just wasn't interesting enough to attract my attention. Not recommended.

There's hardly a great song without a choir but who are these backing vocalists? Most of us don't even know exist yet they are vitally important and always have been.

The theme of this unusual and original documentary takes the focus out of centre stage and places it 'literally' 20 feet from stardom and this is where these characters end up staying.

Brilliant voices, versatility, paramount to music as well as established artists yet they don't quite cut it as solo artists. These 20 feet remain unwalked and those in the documentary who tried it, it either did not work out, or they did not reach the expected or deserved heights. Some of them have sung alongside the biggest names in music over several decades, yet until I watched this tribute I was not aware they even existed.

Brought to mind an old saying about soldiers winning the battles and generals the glory. These brilliant talents seem to have a permanent place outside the pantheon although it exists because of them.

Well researched, neatly presented, this is poignant documentary cinema at its best.

As a professional musician myself, it was particularly wonderful to see these marvelous singers and entertainers finally getting their full due in a film all their own. So often, singers with far less talent get the spotlight, with these incredibly brilliant voices so often left behind, or worse still, never given the credit their stellar talent truly deserves. This film, happily, fills that void. You could say the same of great actors. Only a handful of them get the attention, while so many others, often more talented, have to make due with being the perpetual "second fiddle." That said, I also noticed that the one thing that often separates great background singers from great soloists is something I simply call, "charisma," that hard to describe, magnetic, magical quality that makes someone able to take that spotlight, and fill it. Although there are those who have made successful careers largely built upon physical looks alone, this singular characteristic is the one that separates the stars from the "also-rans," in my opinion. But in any regard, this film never fails to capture this elusive quality, while still giving these amazing talents the accolades that they've so rightfully earned. Well worth watching.

They're the secret weapons behind most of the iconic music of their era but the public rarely knows their names. They take over the world of white backup singers and plain vanilla performances. They come from the gospel world. Darlene Love works under producer Phil Spector who uses her voice and released it as other people. These women are part of some of the most iconic songs ever.

This is a lot of information and a lot of different people. There are plenty of big names and recognizable faces. It's a lot of stories and songs. The first half is more like a highlight reel of fascinating behind-the-scene snippets. There's nothing wrong with that but it does get a little repetitive. The overall flow does allow the flow of time to deliver an overall story of backup singing in general. The second half recounts some of the girls trying to make it on their own and that part is interesting.

Before I watched this I remembered thinking I hope this is more than just a documentary that says background singers are talented too and are great musicians etc. and I really hoped I would hear about the motivations of these singers and would get a sense of why they are so happy to not be in the spotlight. In the end this isn't about motivations or people or the spotlight- to be honest I don't know what it's about. This film is shapeless and formless and doesn't have a structure and as such cannot really achieve anything. Worst of all this film is boring. I don't really care about the subject (the music industry) but what I wanted is to care about the singers themselves and understand them. I completely understand that documentaries are meant to focus on their main idea but I feel that you need some humanity to get people who don't already have an interest in it to care. Great documentaries will interest people who don't already know about the subject matter and this film doesn't do that or at least didn't with me. I couldn't wait till it was finished and I could move onto other films. 4/10

This Documentary depicts some wonderful ladies of music, and their trials and tribulations. It also depicts some fantastic back stage stories and behind the scenes background on some wonderful artists and music, and damn these ladies can sing. A definite recommendation for any music lover with contributions from top artists. Alas the topic holding the thread together - as to why most backing singers are Twenty feet from Stardom - comes as no surprise and is summed up briefly by Sting and even Mick Jagger (who lets face it is a man of an acquired taste regarding voice) in one sentence from each of them. Nonetheless it's a great look at music through the years and you do feel for these lovely warm people, some of which were certainly shafted at times in their careers, however we all kinda know now that's the music business. We'll probably never see their like again so well worth spending some time with them.

This music documentary, unlike any of its predecessors, focuses on artists not usually the center of attention in the music industry, the backup singers. This film portrayed the careers of the unsung forces behind many notable cuts from the past fifty years.

The essence of these great backup singers is rooted in gospel music and black culture. In the 60s, singers like Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Patti Austin, and many other black women (and a few men) became the sound of many legendary cuts, for which they did not receive the recognition they deserved. Many songs from that era's catchy hooks came from these artists, but unless you are a music historian, you wouldn't be aware. This movie sheds light on the hidden stars behind some of the most famous tunes in history.

And the colored girls go/"Doo do doo do doo do do doo "  Lou Reed Walk On The Wild Side

The only artist of the bunch that I knew anything about previous to this film was Darlene Love from her previous encounters with Bruce Springsteen, but this movie was extremely enlightening about her rise,fall, and resurrection. It chronicled her days as (in)famous record producer, Phil Spector's go-to-girl in creating hit after hit in the 60s. He helped spark her career as lead singer of The Blossoms, but also had her record hit songs such as He's A Rebel, and then release them under a faux group name and have a group lip sync them for performances (in the case of He's A Rebel, it is credited to The Crystals). Even when Love finally broke free of Spector's hold, he ultimately bought her back in, thus putting a damper on her hopes and dreams until much later in her career. Her eventual election into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2011 is one of the movies, and her careers, high points. Most of the other backup vocalists did not have the same amount of success Love had, but their stories were fascinating nonetheless.

Through all the hardships these singers faced, there is a great story of liberation that came with rock 'n' roll, specifically from the United Kingdom. Many artists from the UK were fascinated by the soulful harmonies produced by these early backup vocalists and wanted that sound replicated in their recordings. Musicians from Joe Cocker, David Bowie, and The Rolling Stones all feature these vocalists on some of their most classic recordings. Merry Clayton's tale marking one of the most prolific and strongest vocals in rock history is truly an amazing thing. Her chilling screams of "Rape, murder/It's just a shot away" in The Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter sends chills down the spine of anyone who hears it. The Rolling Stones have continued to recruit black, female vocalists to this day including Lisa Fischer, whose career is also highlighted in this film. A most poignant point in the movie depicts four images of Fischer fading in, harmonizing with herself, and then fades out until we are left with nothing but a single microphone as we are told of the lessening of demand for backup vocalists in today's industry.

Towards the end of the film Sting plays with the idea that maybe it is just pure luck that those who have "made it" are where they are. Patti Austin comments that one needs a certain amount of "ego" to make it in the music business. Maybe it is a combination of both.

This film is a must see for any music lover, as it is extremely entertaining and enlightening as a great untold story of the music business.

"20 Feet from Stardom" is immensely enjoyable, affectionate and profoundly compassionate look at the life and destines of background singers, hence the title. It is something I was aware long ago - probably back in the 1980s when I was teenager listening than-current pop hit "Culture Club" and quickly noted that backing vocals of Helen Terry were far superior to the main singer. Through the years it became kind of hobby to spot great background voices without whom the final results would never be the same, it seems no matter how great stars were, they often shone even better (or were inspired by) when they have brilliant and oh-so-brief support from the background. This documentary finally set the record straight - yes, these anonymous voices are equally important and as someone noted, trough the years stars change but musicians and backing vocals on the stage always stay there constantly present.

Tons of famous people here talk about phenomenon of backing vocalists - everybody from Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Sting and Bruce Springsteen theorize about importance of background singers on their albums and that little/huge step that separates musician from a star. Some of those girls are actually far more comfortable in the background than being in the spotlight. Naturally there is a thrill of ambition but also a frustration when promises and plans don't work out. Many of them were so celebrated in the field that they always found work, but even more of them suffered humiliations, cheating and simply quick change of music trends. What is most fascinating is something I always wondered about - some of these backing vocalists are honest-to-God far superior singers than many solo artists.

Bette Midler makes interesting statement when she describes music industry in 1950s where backing vocalists were without exception mostly white, sugary and cheerful voices until early 1960s when Phil Spector and the whole girl-group phenomenon finally ushered powerful black voices on the scene. Here is where mighty Darlene Love comes in the picture and she is legendary background singer on whose shoulder everybody else was standing ever since - even with the fact that she was impoverished and anonymous (reduced to cleaning houses) when her hit singles played on the radio, people like Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder paid attention to that girl in the background. Documentary also follows destines of other voices like Mable John (a former Raelette behind Ray Charles), ex-Ikette Claudia Lennear, powerhouse voices like Merry Clayton and Tata Vega (who sang in "Color Purple"), people like The Waters Family (who sang behind every possible project imaginable) up to present time with Judith Hill (behind Michael Jackson) and most fascinating of all, Lisa Fischer who is in words of Chris Botti "a freak of nature" and can sing circles around everybody in the business - just watching her singing is seriously life-changing experience because this girl sings from a deep spiritual place from somewhere inside her and though people in the industry recognize this (she is often not just backing vocalist on Sting/The Rolling Stones/Tina Turner tours but constantly given solo spot to shine) her career never really took off. She got herself "Grammy" for one album and than disappeared in the background again - Patti Austin thinks that no matter how strange this might sounds, some people genuinely prefer camaraderie and joy of group creation to celebrity status. Tata Vega thinks that this is a true, spiritual magic of music and not anything else about the business. Lastly, Merry Clayton is still crushed when decades after her solo albums went nowhere reminisces how she expected that if she gave everything honestly and from the heart, the success will happen automatically. (She was the unforgettable voice behind "Gimme shelter" on The Rolling Stones classic). 

I truly enjoyed this movie and was even more excited to find out it was awarded with "Oscar" for the best documentary, which gave chance to Darlene Love to stand on the Academy Award podium and raise that powerful voice to the skies. She really unleashed it and its impossible to watch that moment without celebrating it together with her. Raise the glass for all the ladies from the background because they deserve it.

I came across this movie as a preview for another film and I got it out of the library. I loved it and the ladies they featured. These ladies are legends and stars - they are not 20 feet from it they are knee deep in it.... I especially like the special features with the extended interviews. How nice it is to even be considered 20 feet from stardom, it is a blessing as well as a position earned through hard work, dedication and love of sharing the talent. It made me think about the position of a background session singer like a background musician...there are so many great musician out there and not all of them are stars, but they are working, well-respected and sought after...what more would anyone want from the entertainment business...it's a reward. These ladies are those people.
