### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
I must say I was very excited to see this movie in the international film festival hosted here in Auckland.

Set in corrupt small northern Russian town, that could very much be any other town, or even country, in the world, Leviafan explores the confrontation of a man against the mayor. The last wants to kick him out of his house for his own benefit.

Superb photography, superb acting, spine chilling music, solid plot and dark humor touches make Leviafan a truly rewarding experience. One of the best movies I have seen in some time. Do not let the duration discourage you, hours fly. When you glance at your watch for the first time the movie will be over.

Be ready to pity, hate and love the characters. Laugh, feel anguish and rage and enjoy this emotional roller-coaster.

Leviathan takes a long, immersive look at the machinations of corrupted power in the lives of the powerless, who desperately struggle to stay the course, hoping against hope to win a losing battle.

A man and his family face off against a politically backed fat cat who wishes to buy the piece of land upon which stands their house, willing to destroy their family nest to raise a modern building in its stead. The grandiose, solemn music of Philip Glass (Akhnaten; Act I Prelude) opens and ends the movie, flanking it like a sturdy front and back cover a fine book from a Russian master's pen. Other than that, the movie is rather stark, musically and otherwise. It is remarkable how effective silent scenes can be. With little music and less sound effects, the film has your undivided attention, reaching emotional heights towards the end. The lack of a musical backdrop further enhances the gritty realism that imbues all the 140 minutes. Relationships between the characters evolve and change significantly over the span of the movie, and though the patterns are somewhat familiar, interpersonal developments are portrayed with commendable subtlety and brilliance. There is a lot of intelligence to the storytelling; much can be understood without words. We embark on a chilling journey into the land and home of ordinary, simple folks, who are kicking and screaming for justice under the suffocating oppression of ruthless power, also blighted by their own frailty.

Leviathan is an outstanding work of art that manages to drive home universally relevant points with sparkling clarity in its refreshingly honest way. A highly recommended piece.

First and foremost, I find it hard to agree with the opinion of those who think this film is depressing. It's rather a good representation of a specific age and its problems; it's the old story of Job reworked to fit the modern age - and it's reworked in a way that questions everything and never settles for a final opinion. In its way of questioning about the most basic of human needs, Leviathan is (because of its dark undertones) some kind of a meditation on the meaning of human relations, institutions and faith in the confusion of modern, informational-based society. 

Myths include times of darkness as well as those of light. In order for one to reach the light, one must go through darkness first. Thanks to directors like Zvyagintsev, every now and then we are brought perfect darkness on a silver plate. Just to remind us that there is not only light and that our obtained knowledge is more of a habitual knowledge and that there are actually other, deeper ways to comprehend the world around us.

Leviathan was first mentioned in the book of Job in the old testament. In it, Leviathan is a creature, which only God can tame, and tame it he shall, just to prove to Job that he is the only one that's able to do it. That's to say, God is above all human beings, because human beings should never be allowed perfect freedom; for they will not know how to use it and end up hurting each other. 

It's the dark side of human nature that gets engaged when one doesn't know how to use all the freedom that's given to him. Too much freedom, pretty paradoxically, ends up meaning too little freedom if we are not mature enough to understand it through rationalization or art. If that is the case, we start connecting freedom to infinite possibilities, but infinite possibilities mean a priori that we will never be able to achieve them all. In that, we feel alone, hopeless, and, to grasp freedom momentarily, we are even willing to hurt others. Soon we see the same behavioral patterns in others and in a blink of an eye that kind of behavior becomes normal, a notion around which we construct our lives. Usually we don't notice these patterns until we are face-to-face with their consequences - especially the life- threatening ones. 

Even if we have been mistreated and have mistreated others ourselves, we keep on walking in the same circles, kind of hoping that we can walk the next one in a shorter period of time. Hoping that something will just get solved by itself and then we will be able to live again, without all of the garbage that has slowly been growing in us. But it sadly doesn't function like that - in order to get rid of the garbage, we have to take it out; we have to make an effort, a sacrifice. Something Tarkovsky, of whom traces we can see in Zvyagintsev's filmmaking, mentioned a lot in his films, especially in his last one (Offret/The sacrifice).

Sadly enough, none of the characters in this film is able to make that sacrifice, none of them is able to step out of the wicked wheel that inevitably - from the first scene on - leads to tragedy. Despite the movie's apparent dark tone, there are some humorous and upbeat scenes, that provoke laugh and cast some light on the positive traits of these characters, that are otherwise caught in their own past, in their mistakes and fears.

Leviathan, (which is founded upon the book of Job of the Old testament; Thomas Hobbes' book of the same title and a true, 21st century story of an American, struggling with authorities) is a wake-up call. It is not desperate or preaching in demeanor, it is however something we are not very used to - seeing things from a different perspective.

The final scene completely blew me away because it reminded me of being caught in a heavy storm while surfing on Spanish coast a couple of months prior to seeing the film. The first time in my life I was helpless and I realized that I am not such a tough guy, that I don't behold all the answers. But what is there that beholds all the answers? Is there even such a thing? They used to believe in monsters, in religions, in systems... As children, we believed in all kinds of things. But what, if anything, should we believe now, in an information age, when we have so much information to work with; when we learned to tell apart a myth from reality?

Greetings again from the darkness. It may surprise some that the most relatable of the Foreign Language films submitted for Oscar consideration this year may be a rural Russian re-imagining of the Book of Job with a tip of the cap to a 1651 book from Thomas Hobbes, and so much alcohol consumption that it should carry a Warning notice for anyone in recovery.

Please don't interpret the description of relatable to mean likable or enjoyable, at least not in the traditional sense. This latest from director Andrey Zvyagintsev (The Return, 2003) is tough to watch with its theme of the working class vs the government. Who holds the power in this clash is obvious in a case of eminent domain, as Kolya (Aleksey Sorebryakov) tries everything (including blackmail) to hold on to his home and business in a fight against the Mayor (Roman Madyanov).

Religion, politics, and the judicial system team up to ensure the imbalance of power remains in effect, and Kolya's belief in the system slowly evaporates. It's particularly interesting to note how his consumption of Vodka evolves from a shot glass to full bottles as his home slips away.

The story takes place in northwest Russia in the Kola Peninsula of the Barents Sea. It's a dramatic setting with vast landscapes, including the carcasses of fishing boats and giant whales  a statement of what happens to those left behind as times change  much like what happens to Kolya.

As dramatic as the landscape is, the story is actually quite small. It's the struggle of one family against a system that has corruption down to a science. When Kolya asks his lawyer friend Dmitri (Vladimir Vdovitschenkov) to play dirty with the Mayor, he has no idea how this will impact his life and that of his younger wife Lilya (Elena Lyadova) and son Roma (Sergey Pokhodaev). 

There is very little comic relief in the film  only a single sequence involving target practice on pictures of past Russian officials, but the story and acting are so grounded that at times it feels much like a documentary. It's always a bit of a cold slap to be reminded of how the righteous often struggle with injustice, but rarely will you see it better presented than this.

Leviathan is a fascinating tale of corruption and betrayal, relying on some intriguing visual allegories and symbolisms as a way to propel the story. I was surprised by the great amount of witty humor in the first portion of the film, which proved to be very entertaining, also serving as a display of helplessness towards the abuse of power and corruption that surround the town. Then, we follow the destructive paths some of the characters end up taking and the film becomes truly somber. The performances are all top notch and we are rewarded with some of the most breathtaking cinematography ever shown on screen. Director Andrey Zvyagintsev's geniality consists in leaving it up to the viewer to decide what to make of the fate of these people, ending the picture with a very clever and tragically ironic turn of events. Leviathan is one of the year's finest films and an absolute must-see!

"Leviathan" is a David and Goliath story set in a desolate Russian fishing-town.

We've seen it before- a man desperately tries to keep his property being taken away from rich greedy fat cats.

But this is also a strong family drama, a tale of friendship, betrayal, corruption, hope, hopelessness...

Impressive acting overall, the very slow paced narrative and almost no music besides two fitting Philip Glass pieces make this a movie to remember. 

The cinematography also deserves a mention, there are countless wonderfully framed scenes. 

Excellent slow burning drama.

From the first five minutes, I was appealed to this movie more than 3/4 of what I've seen this year. It was dark, it was beautifully shot, and established its characters nicely. People complain it took too long for the characters to be established and that the story took too long to unfold. Haven't you heard of visual storytelling? As it plays out, you find out the dark shadows that follow each character and who they really are in the situation they're in. From the wife (most interesting character), to the step- son of the wife. The father is a dark character that is strained beyond limits, and the fantastic acting portrayed by the father is just one of the great performances done by all the actors and actresses. It fights the bond of love, land, and power. The corruption that still stands tall in Russia and its small towns that surround the leviathan that is the story. It unravels extremely slow, but thats what makes more of an impact. The over-thirty second shot of the woman in court explaining the case is so well done, you can really just see the effort put into each role in the film. If only American films could be so well thought out. For any person who has the near two and a half hour time to watch a superb film, sit down and immerse yourself into the gloomy world that inhabits these characters. It teaches you, it haunts you, it stays with you.

I was so impressed with this movie: it just has it all. The story is about a man, Kolya, who risks to loose his property because of the arrogance of the corrupted major, the leviathan. The film opens with a beautiful sequence of landscape - cinematography is remarkable and shows the wide, desolate environment that reflects the isolation of the characters themselves. The screenplay is intriguing and well written - nothing's taken for granted and both the story and the dialogs are deeply constructed.

Kolya's character, sustained with a sincere performance, needs to be saved even though his freedom might have dangerous consequences. He refuses his friend's, Dimitry, advice to move on and build a new life somewhere else and chooses to fight for his house. The role of the woman is that of a submitted wife always watching and never taking part of any conversation or decision. She is weak and we notice it also from the relationship she has with Kolya's son. Dimitry, instead, is seen as a hero: he is admired by Kolya and fascinates Lilya (Kolya's wife). The character's unsolved dilemmas are the real trap that drags them to despair - the leviathan is inside themselves in the first place. It's a movie that is worth seeing because of his richness in humanity. It reminds us that we are all waiting for someone who can save us, maybe putting our needs in front of everyone without realizing that our decision might harm people near us.

From the very beginning up to very end you can feel the tension and the emotions up to a pure exaggeration! This is not at all something negative! The photography is absolutely enchanting and offers to the viewer that beautiful heartbeat that in a such a film is essential. Amazing, unforgettable landscapes! 

You cannot resist in taking sides when you see and understand the heroes battling with their demons and their enemies, that seem to be surrounding everything that makes their lives...

Andrey Zvyagintsev after the wonders of drama, passion and mystic lyricism (Vozvrashchenie and Izgnanie) offers yet another one similar of his creations, adding though, a "spicy" allow me to say subject, a taboo, about corruption in modern day Russia and how all those things which are considered as high values to the Russian State and people, seem to be part in this injustice, destroying peoples' lives.

cold, cruel, minimalistic. the force of image and the silence. the atmosphere from The Return, the characters from Elena. and the fight against almighty corrupt system. the lost of each pillar of existence and the desire to demonstrate your truth. inspired cast and strange landscapes. and, sure, a lot of controversies. in fact, the film is only tool for remind the heart of reality. a manifesto without enthusiasm. a verdict. it is beautiful and deep bitter. because it reflects the forms of falling world. the solitude as last solution. the pressure of system. the fight for survive. a film who reminds basic things. and a great director as inspired guide in the heart of reality. one of Rusian movies who could remind many masterpieces. but it is not Tarkovsky, it is not Abuladze, it remains a Zvyagintsev. his confession. about a reality and about new Job.

Really disappointed in this film. Though it is superbly shot, and the acting is fine, there are two many unconvincing scenes and underdeveloped character and plot. Little man versus the big guy and loses is hardly a plot line with much to say. We know in every country, but blatantly in Russia, there is endemic corruption. In this film we have big shot lawyer buddy who seems to believe in the law. However he can hardly be surprised that baddie mayor has him roughed up can he? And when he goes back to Moscow, why doesn't he destroy the mayor with his information. The plot line of him shagging his mate's missus so they are driven apart is so clumsy. Why on earth would she risk everything so casually; and to be caught at it on a picnic? When her devoted husband decides to forgive her and start again, why would she then kill herself? Tragedy is a feature of Russian fiction but when what intuition tells us should happen, happens, you ask yourself what's the point of the film.

This extremely long and tedious Russian production has been slavishly praised merely because it is an heavyhanded and obvious allegory of life for the Little Guy in Putin's Russia, and I throw in a Spoiler Alert that is hardly necessary: In the first few minutes you learn that Kolya is the L.G., owner of a piece of gorgeous waterfront property that has been in his family for several generations, and that the Big Guy is Vadim, who wants it for a rigged price that is one- sixth of its value, and who is also the greedy, crooked boorish mayor. So you know what happens next: in a long series of legal manipulations, Kolya is repeatedly crushed by Vadim. For lagniappe he is betrayed by his wife and his friends, then, when Vadim decides he'd rather not pay anything for Kolya's land, has him framed for murder. Most male characters in this film are getting stinko a good deal of the time and, save for the fact that Kolya gets progressively drunker, there is no character development. Why would there be? There are no characters here, only cardboard cutouts, and all of them are to one degree or another stupid and cruel. This probably got past Russia's censors because they dozed off, and viewers likewise run that risk. Sole point of interest: when, if ever, will the priest's sermon finally end? Place your bets!

"All power comes from God. As long as it suits Him, fear not."

After receiving an Oscar nomination for best foreign film, I finally decided to watch this 140 minute long movie. I was hopeful I was finally going to see Russians not having to play villains, but to my surprise this film attacks its own society and the corruption behind its government and official church. It takes a while to get into but after the slow opening twenty minutes the plot began to hook me and the next two hours flew by as the plot got better and better. Despite being a film that brilliantly attacks the corruption of its own government and society, it does so in a universal way so we can all relate to these issues. Loosely based on the biblical story of Job, we follow the main character go through one injustice after another. Director Andrey Zvyagintsev brilliantly captures the humanity of this working class family who are forced out of their own property by the corrupt local Mayor. It is the universal tale of an everyday man struggling against the injustices of an oppressive system (The Clash's "I Fought the Law" song came to mind several times while watching this film). We get glimpses of hope when a friend of the family comes to their defense and tries to confront the big man by uncovering some dirt from his past, but some interesting twists take place and the family dynamics are shaken. The final fifteen minutes of this film were brilliant and I am glad Zvyaginstsev didn't sell out for an easy or feel good ending. The cinematography is also gorgeous thanks to the beautiful location. The film takes place in a small coastal town near the Barents Sea and we get several amazing shots of the waves crashing into the rocks. The beautiful landscape is a huge contrast with the darkness of the corrupt characters. Leviathan is a brilliant film that works as a social satire. Leviathan is a monstrous sea creature mentioned in the Bible, and it is the perfect title for a film that focuses on a small man facing monstrous obstacles. I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this film as much as I did. I still have a lot of catching up with my foreign films, but so far this is my favorite and my frontrunner for the Oscars. 

The performances in this film were also great. Aleksey Serebryakov plays the lead character and he captures the essence and humanity of the hard working class. He has built his own home were he lives with his wife and child working as a mechanic. His wife works at a fish factory. He is desperate and angry for the injustice he is suffering knowing that he is about to lose his home and property. His good friend who is now a lawyer in Moscow has come to his rescue. He is also brilliantly played by Vladimir Vdovichenkov. He is the voice of reason in the film and is always trying to calm down Nikolay who has a strong temper. The corrupt lawyer is played by Roman Madyanov. He makes it easy for the audience to hate him because he represents all the injustice and corruption that we face. Nikolay's wife is played by the beautiful Elena Lyadova and she does a great job of portraying this fragile character. However my favorite supporting performance came from Anna Ukolova who plays a friend of the family and also works with Nikolay's wife. She always has some sarcastic comment about men or officials and she delivers most of the laughs in the movie. Her character helped lighten up the mood at times. The other thing that lightens the mood is the constant drinking in the movie (warning: you might get drunk just by watching them jug down those Vodka bottles). The harsh conditions that these people face force them to find refuge in their alcohol in order to suppress their pain (something many people can relate to as well). What really stands out in this film is that instead of portraying some of the key scenes Zvyaginstev decides to omit them and we are only exposed to the results and its consequences.

The Russian men of Leviathan are drunk and depressed. The rich and powerful seek to oppress them at every turn. The women are scarcely there except to offer refreshment. Got some tea? Got a bottle of water? Should we start on the kebabs? Of course, these pleasantries are a cover for an affair that seeks to rip this family apart. When they go on a camping trip, they drink in excess and shot bottles. When the bottles are all smashed, the targets are Soviet figures of the past. Zvyagintsev, to his credit, does reel it back by not allowing the current head of state's face to end up on that brick wall. That would have taken the already meandering social-political commentary to unbearable levels. 

The bad guy is Mayor Vadim, who seeks to force out Kolya and acquire his land for his own developmental properties. What he is planning is not known, but it seems to be something grand and selfish. A mansion, Kolya theorises. A long winded court order lays out all the struggles in a matter of minutes, and condenses the plot like a Steig Larson novel. We are forced to find some sort of emotion in Aleksei Serebryakov's withered, anguished expression (which he does a good job of expressing). In the midst of the evil dealings, and his exasperation at these small town folk not bowing down to his will and vision, there is a scene with a priest that seemingly reeks of an attempt to humanise him. He talks pointedly with a priest as if it was a confession, and is asked about the status of his wife and kids like a pleasant bumping into a friend. Revisiting this scene after the final revelation, it has a different feel to it. They empower themselves with the word of God, and believe that what they are doing is right. They would never kill a man who was attempting to blackmail them, but they do just as much as that. 

The Koyla family is afforded less complexity. The son has a problem with the step-mum, as domestic dramas go. There is an affair that does not seem particularly motivated (although Dmitri is a very strong character, and his contrasting actions of fighting tooth and nail for his friend's land while breaking up his marriage speak loudly - when Vadim questions how a prestigious lawyer could be presiding the case, he does not consider the loyalty and act of friendship). The long-winded runtime might suggest that something deeper is created, but much of it is swallowed up by legal talk and incidents that never seem to go their way. Koyla flares up at every opportunity, and this makes its impact even worse. 

Serebryakov has a tendency to implicit suggest during moments of great tension. This is somewhat of a hit and miss. In some situations, it is very effective. As the affair is revealed, a young boy runs and yells of something seemingly more sinister. Then we linger on a secondary character, and let the burst fire of the gunshots tell us what has happened. This works because the off-the-hinge violence of Koyla has been previously established, and we can guess what would cause such an extreme reaction. And later, in the same vein, we know why Roma is running away from what he has seen in the basement, and we can link the rape to the suicide. In other cases, it chops up moments of extreme emotional reaction. We see Kolya's haggard body stumble to a halt over Lilya's corpse, but instead of letting Serebryakov react, it cuts away to his shattered face, an undetermined amount of time later. We are made to extrapolate his grief and his religious bargaining is a rather lame scene to make up for it. 

This is Job through and through, but for the final reward. We have a somewhat nuanced depiction of the government and church coming together for their own mutual selfish cause, and trying to justify it. This is intriguing, but the common man's story suffers for it. Everything must go wrong for them. There is no judge in to accept their statement. There is no one authorised to adjudicate. Legal pleas, months of weary and desperate fighting, fly by in mere seconds and seems to beat and beat the man until the struggle is all out of him. It opens and closes with the same shots of landscape, the natural beauty and power, the way it has ravaged a ship in its cold indifference. I suppose it is trying to suggest the absence and carelessness of God, and how men take what they want in their own way. The almost complete silence in the soundtrack rings true. It is bleak without restraint.

"Leviathan" was nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Because of this, I naturally had high expectations for this Russian movie. Sadly, it had a great set-up but the film just fizzled into nothing...

When the film begins, Kolya's life is a bit of a mess. The local crooked mayor, Vadim, has been fighting to take much of Kolya's property using the notion of eminent domain (an often abused government policy that takes land for public use and compensates the homeowner...with what the government thinks is a fair value for your property). However, Kolya's friend is a lawyer from Moscow and if they lose their appeal, he's going to try blackmailing the mayor into abandoning this venture. How? He has incriminating evidence about some of the mayor's illegal activities--MOB activities. Not necessarily a smart way to fight back, but this did set a nice stage for the film. 

Unfortunately, following the lawyer's private meeting with the mayor, the film just went no where. The film claims to be inspired by the Book of Job. Horrible things happen again and again to Kolya--just like Job. HOWEVER, and this is important, in Job, eventually the horrible stuff ended and Job became prosperous once again. In this film, it just ended with Kolya going to prison and losing everything. What sort of finale is that?! And, between the lawyer meeting with the mayor and this awful ending, the film just limped along and was rather boring and directionless. Not an enjoyable viewing experience or one that seemed to have much meaning.

What would compel me to give this film ten full stars? There has to have been something to knock at least one off. Otherwise I'm saying that this is a cinematic masterpiece on all levels. 

It simply is, and I can make my own points about it.

Plot: Spot on, with some twists and turns to keep the viewer not only glued to the story, but wanting more. The plot further peels open, and I was left simply nodding my head in disbelief. This is not the kind of film that is feel-good. If you want all of the endings tied up like a Christmas bow, forget it, as Leviathan is NOT for you. 

Cinematography: Crisp, colorful, artistic, and well-conceived. Anyone not privy to life in Russia will feel like they've gotten their passport stamped by Vladamir Putin himself. Watch the film to get the sense of coldness of an unforgiving, northern climate. Utilizing the magic hour, and pre-dawn/twilight settings, it was an incredible visual experience.

Acting: The only actor who didn't seem so believable was a 3-year-old in a church near the end of the movie. Yet he didn't have any bearing on the film. The rest of the characters really made their parts believable, to the teeth. Even the young actor, Sergey Pokhodaev, truly didn't seem like the no-it-all you love to hate. He was conflicted and you could understand why. The officials seemed truly official, just like those plain clothes Russian cops, whom I would never want to meet. And when the players were drunk (which was often), I could believe that they really were blitzed during filming. Some might get bothered by the amount of vodka-drinking, but that's a big Russian staple. The acting, from the happiness, to the anger, disappointment, pain and sorrow, couldn't have been better.

Believability: One wonders if this kind of thing truly happens. It's downright scary. No spoilers, you'll see when you watch the film, and I strongly urge true film lovers to watch this. I just shook my head and asked if this also happens in the U.S. Maybe so, maybe not with such a stronghold. I can imagine in places like Russia, Mexico, and other struggling economies, it is very possible. 

Music: The film used old music from Philip Glass (works that reminded me of Chronos and Koyaanisqatsi) at the start and end of the movie, and only sparsely added drone violins to suggest impending trouble. The film didn't need much music, which is also the sign of excellent work.

Ambiance: What a way to showcase Russian life and livelihood. How bleak, yet how beautiful? I want to watch it again and again, just to wrap my brain around the scope of what I just watched. Leviathan was truly well-planned and well-executed. Who are these actors? Looking at the main characters' bodies of work, they've been in front of the cameras for numerous films, but part of the effort of great filmmaking is assembling the cast, which was also top- notch. 

I feel like I was plucked right down in the town of Kirovsk, compelled to follow as a passenger as all this unwound and unraveled, getting frustrated with any roadblock that came. How poignant that Leviathan starts so innocently and yet who in the end, is innocent?

There's certainly a feeling of dread, of malice, that really takes over the film even in its early stages. It's rather impressive. The opening and closing shots are of very much resemblance and they do sort of open and close this one tale. It's very much in line with a dark thriller (and in many ways this is that). It's rather impressive, rather stoic. The cinematography is rather beautiful, and it sets off the tone rather well. There are some truly impressive shots in this piece of work, it even reminded me of The White Ribbon. I'm not sure I loved everything about how the script develops, but the film as a whole is certainly very good and perhaps will remain as the best from the Foreign Language nominees. Certainly recommended, but not always an easy viewing.

While it moves about as slow as the leviathan at the heart of its title reference, Andrey Zvyagintsev's biblically inspired family drama is worth sticking it out for and while it doesn't have the same impact as his highly thought of 2003 film The Return, Leviathan is a unique and troublesome picture that offers a unique look at Russian life and politics.

Loosely based around the Bible story of Job and his many trials, Leviathan is anything but an easy watch and in true Russian fashion, don't go into this experience expecting happy or colourful endings as the path to this tale is fraught with danger, lies and coldly played tactics. Zvyagintsev is a master of mood and he embeds this stunningly well shot and hauntingly scored (Philip Glass provides the films sparsely used tunes) film with an ever ominous cloud of dread and while the film seems set on a certain direction within the first hour, things quickly turn in another way entirely when a fateful camping trip takes place between our films mains players.

What takes place between our traveling business/family man Kolya or Nikolay, his oppressed wife Lilya, their lawyer and friend Dmitriy and corrupt local mayor Mer is much better discovered as one watches proceedings take place and there are frequent moments where you feel someone is one up on another only for the narrative to twist conventions and while it remains slightly frustrating that certain questions remain largely under lock and key come the final scenes, Leviathan's web covers a broad enough spectrum that has commentary on everything from the church system in Russia through to Vladimir Putin's ever present figure being both a literal and figurative presence over the country.

Understandably recognised at film festivals the world over and awards ceremonies in equal measure (this really is the type of product Cannes and the Academy lap up) Leviathan doesn't break any new ground or truly justify its nearly snail paced plotting but despite there not being much to actually love about this picture, this is a bleak drama filled with deeply unnerving moments which will make it a film you're likely to ponder upon days after the final reels have played out.

A movie wide like Russia. And, again, as it was happening anywhere on the globe, the situations of injustice, so identical ...

The evil mayor of the coastal town in the north of Russia holds all in his hands. Wanting to get some land he offers Kolya some small amount. He wants to build a resort. Kolya refuses to move away with his wife and child. Kolya repairs cars for the local police and hopes that they will protect him in the moment occurs. Kolya's friend, lawyer from Moscow, Dmitry, comes to help The characters are carefully and faithfully made. The atmosphere is quiet diabolical, as on a painted fresco and associative pointing to strong anomalies meaningfulness of life ... well ... like Tarkovsky say ... Human drama, strong, harsh and bold. Will there be a recoil and recognize in this timeless work? All of us?

It's easy to find a film that makes you sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Even if you find yourself screening an utterly terrible film, it's possible to check your brain at the door and try to forget about it all when you leave. The 2014 Russian film "Leviathan" is neither of those films. 

There is an extremely rare category of movies that absolutely punish the audience, presenting multiple depressing turns for characters that just can't seem to win. Yet, when we leave and head home, we feel rejuvenated, refreshed, and loaded a heap of factors to think about for days, even weeks to come. "Leviathan" is that film.

The Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee follows Kolya, played excellently by Aleksey Serebryakov, a man living in a small Russian town with his wife (Elena Lyadova) and son (Sergey Pokhodaev). His struggles come from the corrupt mayor (Roman Madyanov) who wants to buy his land for an unfair price. Kolya responds by turning to an old friend (Vladimir Vdovichenkov); an attorney who is collecting information with the power to bring the mayor down. 

This film, crafted masterfully by director Andrey Zvyagintsev and cinematographer Mikhail Krichman, is so realistic it's almost frightening. To see this story and realize that there are actually people out there (especially in Russia) who struggle the way Kolya and his family do is quite unsettling. It's also strangely rewarding, not because we enjoy seeing these traumatic experiences, but because we now know that realistic tales like this can be put on film in this fashion. 

Despite its dark tone, the film is beautiful. Awe-inspiring shots of Russia's landscape are presented along with shots of characters that have the ability to present true emotion even when there is no dialogue. I believe a certain shot, that of Kolya's son looking onward at a giant whale skeleton, could become iconic in years to come when we are still talking about this film. 

There are a number of ways one could dissect this film for its underlying meanings, but I'm not going to get into that. Partly because I could go on and on about the possibilities, and partly because I hope that any readers I may have will seek out this film and form their own judgments about what it is really trying to say. "Leviathan" is brilliant. It is not confined by the standards of Hollywood. It is the type of film that demands to be seen multiple times, even if its audience isn't always willing to witness the heartbreaking story again and again. It is not the type of film that most people, myself included, will list as one of their favorites, but it might be the best film from the year 2014.

The Priest: "All power comes from God. As long as it suits Him, fear not." The Mayor: "And so, it suits Him?"

God may not be immediately apparent in the god-forsaken Russian coastal town of the rewarding film Leviathan, but the devil surely resides there. Or let's just say the proletariat suffers for Politburo politics rather than God to an extent that is disruptive of daily life and lethal in the wrong circumstances. If you cross Crime and Punishment with a dollop of Dr. Zhivago, you might get a hint of how bleak and fateful this rugged world is, relieved by the beautiful timelessness of the landscape.

Kolya (Aleksay Serebryakov) is a vodka-swilling, perpetually smoking, car-fixing local doomed by the fates and his own temper. Not only does the corrupt local mayor, Vadim (Roman Madyanov), seem destined to seize Kolya's property for a patronage resort, but Kolya" wife, Lilya (Elena Lyadova), is also carrying on with his close friend and attorney, Dimi (Vladimir Vdovichenkov), and no good to come of either ill-fortunes. 

I was captured the whole time by the sense of impending doom especially when director Andrey Serebryakov is featuring only decrepit buildings and sea wrecks. Given the Russian cinema tradition, those images are sure bets to represent the decay of a society that drinks and broods the whole long day. Not that it's a bad thing; it's just that doom creeps along at a petty pace as it circles victims like Kolya and Lilya, who are decent people but moved by passionate forces that emerge from the rocks and roiling sea. The devil is menacing, powerful, and relentless as it stalks its prey, notwithstanding the priest's counsel that God is the one calling the shots. 

Leviathan, like the titular skeleton of a whale that serves as a figurative touchstone, is long, slow, and dark, confirming a stereotype of hardscrabble Russians trying to survive under the portraits of Putin and Gorbachov, the old and new struggling for the heart of the country. Think of Appalachia joined with Montgomery; now there's a whale of a comparison, and this is a behemoth of a film.

Premise: No matter how good your case, never assume you can beat a corrupt system.

Dripping with symbolism which will impress the most severe movie critic or English professor, Leviathan is a tragic story which keeps on giving long after the 150 minute movie ends. Andrey Zviagintsev (director and screenwriter with Oleg Negin) takes us to a remote fishing village where its main characters Kolya (Aleksey Serebryakov), his teen-aged son, Roman (Sergey Podhodkaev), and new young wife, Lilya (Elena Lyadova), live in a modest home by the sea, in a setting both desolate and beautiful, with an unending supply of medicinal vodka.

The town, like many, has a police force, a church, and a corrupt mayor, Vadim (Roman Madyanov). He wants Kolya's property and wires the system to take it "legally" away from him. 

Despite a determined effort by Kolya's Moscow lawyer friend, Dimitry (Vladimir Vdovichenkov), his appeal to save the property is denied. In a final attempt to change the mayor's mind, Dimitry confronts him with a file of his corrupt past. But the powerful mayor swats him away easily, teaching Dimitry a lesson he will not soon forget. 

As legal proceedings to take away Kolya's home move inexorably forward, Kolya, Lilya, Roman, Dimitry and police friends drive to the mountains for a Russian style picnic -- plenty of vodka, kabobs, and rifles for plinking bottles, while the women gossip and kids play dangerously close to a nearby cliff. Several bad things happen off camera, without explanation, but the aftermath leaves everyone unhappy and Lilya and Dimitry together in a hotel bed. 

After Vadim puts the fear of God in Dimitry, he returns to Moscow defeated. Lilya is more desperate, Kolya is more angry and drinking more vodka. But he still lusts after Lilya and catches her downstairs as they pack their belongings. Finally, Roman becomes enraged at Lilya, blaming her for all the misfortune.

What possible resolution can their be? Therein lies the essence of this leviathan tale. It can leave you thinking very differently about yourself. You may be much closer to Kolya, Lilya, or Roman than you think. 

Beware!

In the Old Testament, the word "leviathan" refers to a sea monster; but the Old Testament has lost some of its clout, and fear of sea monsters is a thing of the past. The film "Leviathan" makes similar metaphorical allusions to present day Russia. Once a feared giant of the international scene, Russia is now trying to rise up from the depths, pulled up by a overtly macho president riding bareback on a horse. Judo flips, threatening neighbours and bombers buzzing past Cornwall are all part of the plan. However, like the image on the "Leviathan" poster, the Russia depicted in "Leviathan" has been rotted by corruption; only bones remain.

The film is set in the isolated village of Teriberka, by the Barents Sea. It is a place of awesome natural beauty, but also abandoned houses, empty vodka bottles and uncomfortable silence. In this setting, a power-hungry mayor tries to take a sea-side home from a hardworking mechanic, with a new wife and son at his side. Allies arrive to assist the mechanic; however, their real motives soon become apparent. No one can be trusted.

A microcosm of modern Russian life, the film takes a dark, harrowing look at a constantly changing political landscape where notions of power ebb and flow; and the bones of a distant past lay on the shore, the flesh long since picked over by post- Perestroika opportunists. Left with nothing but bones, denied even a modest home by the sea, the family under siege symbolizes a Russia that is tired of the uncertainty and corruption of modern Russia. Perhaps it is a Russia that is thinking back to life under Communist dictatorship which, ironically, must have seemed stable, predictable, and safer in comparison. Perhaps it is the film's not-too-subtle attack on contemporary Russian society that lead to it losing the best film prize at the Golden Eagle awards (the Russian Oscars), despite a nomination for best foreign film at the Oscars and winning best film at the Golden Globes. Throughout 2014, "Ida," and "Leviathan" dominated film awards across Europe. Yet, apparently many Russians disliked the film; and some have accused the director of something called "Russophobia". On the other hand, Americans love a dark, bleak, depressing portrait of Russia. If "Leviathan" had images of people queuing for toilet paper, it probably would have snatched the Best Foreign Film Oscar from "Ida".

Several adjectives have been used to describe "Leviathan" - "dark", "biblical", "epic", "stunning" and unforgettable. Overwhelmingly positive reviews are one good reason to see the film. However, another is the fact that cinematic leviathans like this will soon be extinct in Russia. Apparently, in response to the film's negative reception at home, the Russian Ministry of Culture will no longer fund "negative" films. So, be sure to come out and experience a truly great, epic film before the mighty Russian film industry hunts down its own cinematic wonders, until only a massive pile of bones remains.

Leviathan is a brilliant, powerful film - the first I have seen by Zvyagintsev, though I can assure you it won't be the last. Russians have a particular talent for mocking their government through art - from Bulgakov to this - but I have never seen such a tragic critique with no hope in sight.

The political aspect, though, is really only one facet of this masterpiece. The human drama is masterfully woven into ever inch of plot, sound, and camera work. As an example ( ** SPOILER ** ):

Lilya stands at the edge of a cliff and sees the "Leviathan" appear amid crashing waves and a terrifyingly vast ocean. We feel what she suffers: the rejection of her stepson, the guilt from cheating on Kolya, the dread of the impending move into a dilapidated flat. We know what she will do. A less skilled filmmaker would toss her over the cliff right there to relieve our anxiety - instead, somehow we know she committed suicide, and also we feel even more anxious for Kolya as he waits for his wife's return. Maybe she did just leave to Moscow? Until that horrible moment when Kolya is driven to her body on the shore, rain continually obscuring the view through the windshield, we still have a twinge of hope. And in that sense we become Kolya, just as we became Lilya - this is art.

I watched the film a month ago and these images are still vividly present in my memory.

There are no cheap tricks or flat villainy - Kolya's friends don't defend him, but they were likely concerned about his violent reaction to his wife's cheating (again, written perfectly into his character from the very beginning, when he wants to beat his son). How could they know the truth? And why shouldn't they take in Kolya's son for a bit of extra money, after all?

The final scene in the new church is the perfect ending to the madness. We see the Mayor, the only real "villain" of the movie with his family, a believing Christian, repeating the lesson about God's divine justice to his child. The Priest gives a sermon against the foulness of Pussy Riot and Western perversions. The irony is spellbinding, painful to the point of tears.

Russia truly needed this film. And we in the West would do well to find parallels in our own societies, because injustice is our problem too.

Well currently the Rouble in tumbling in value causing many immigrant workers to worry and the giant Leviathan of the Russian economy is experiencing a bit of flux after dominating Gas exports for so long. So this movie is quite topical as the little seen Russia it represents. I must admit the number of Russian movies I have seen is abysmally low, I couldn't even name the last Russian movie I have seen, if any. Nonetheless this is a sterling piece of film making with strong performances throughout. I was expecting it to be a bit more lighter at times (considering Vodka necking permeates the lifestyles) but was drawn in and sucker punched with a much more bleaker drama. Telling a story of people trapped by the corrupt state, it was quite sad to be honest, with an inclusion of colorful characters and far from the norm of film making. Reminded me of some of the great western dramas set in normal peoples lives.Highly recommended.
