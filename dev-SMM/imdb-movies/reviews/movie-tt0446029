### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
The tagline for this film is "An Epic of Epic Epicness" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.

The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something's life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.

While the audience might've been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.

I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you.

This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. 

I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers. 

I truly left the movie saying that " I cant wait to see more films put out by "Oni Productions/Closed on Mondays ". Well done !!!!!

I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.

The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every Wright film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.

The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. Wright's trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.

The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the Seinfeld scene.

Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of Edgar Wrights films or just good silly humour you will love this film.

Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 Morgan

Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.

Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.

All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.

The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.

The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.

Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.

The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made.

I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its "end of level baddies", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special.

Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.

Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.

So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.

Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, "Knives" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!

That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.

The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.

Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face "It's okay, neither have I." Or the band's self-introduction, "We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.

The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.

The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars.

I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.

Before I get to criticizing the movie, let me say that I did feel the movie had SOME positive elements. The visual effects are top notch, successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing, like defeated opponents transforming into coins.

The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same: the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives, NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb, especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also, the ending is very frustrating, with Scott (in my opinion) choosing the wrong person to be with.

I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on, but my guess is based on its length, a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice, I would advise you read the multi-part graphic novel instead of seeing this movie.

Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.

Although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been adapted from a 2004 graphic novel series, it is to a fault like a computer game. It's been directed by Edgar Wright, who previously worked on Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). He has chosen to shoot the film with an overwhelming number of visual tricks that look to have come straight from the graphic novel source and the arcades machines. When someone knocks on Scott's door the onomatopoeic words appear on the screen. When Scott kisses Ramona tiny hearts trickle out between them. During the fight scenes icons popup to reveal Scott's high scores, like an arcade game. But Wright seems too excited by these gimmicks and they are used too frequently. Rather than being charming little treats for the audience, they quickly become excessive. The film's rapid pacing is also problematic. As the director and one of the film's screenwriters Wright seems highly intent on moving through the film's opening quarter as quickly as possible, with rapid cutting hurling the audience from one scene to another. Given the speed of the first act and the array of video game aesthetics thrown in, the rest of the film desperately lacks urgency. It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes, leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing, with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.

Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno (2007), it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self- conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly: "Like with jetpacks?" There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick, a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air (2009), is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead's hair looks her character is still underwritten. It's disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film's central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent on-screen.

Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks, there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It's pacing runs on a single, exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game.

For fans of all things geeky around the world, this film is for YOU! Comedy, action, romance, video games, music; "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" has everything you could ask for. It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.

Though the character feels quite different to his graphic novel counterpart, Michael Cera does an excellent job as the awkward Scott, Kieran Culkin is perfect as Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a much more tragic version of Ramona Flowers but this change still works well.

Scott Pilgrim is a must-see and it deserves more recognition. Go watch it, you'll love it.

This is the perfect movie with perfect cast. I don't even like Michael Cera much, although he was fortunate enough to be in one of the most clever TV shows ever. He's become typecast, but this is one movie which breaks the mold. (Or at least it ignores it and does its own thing.) Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz," and he doesn't disappoint with this. I haven't read the anime series this was based on, but I don't really want to, because this is so much better than it could ever be. To be completely honest, the only thing I don't like his how fast Scott's 'pee bar' empties. Nobody can pee that fast, geez.

But yeah, everyone should watch this, especially video game fans.

Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word "versus" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.

Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.

All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out.

It was showing on Netflix streaming, and I had nothing else to do in this record hot Texas summer, so I watched it. 

I have to give credit, it is a very interesting concept and much of the dialog is snappy and interesting. But overall it is not the kind of movie I enjoy.

Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, musician wanna-bee, and mostly a social misfit. Shy and with low confidence, he has a girlfriend, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau, that is 5 years younger, and underage. When he discusses this with his friends Scott is quick to point out that they haven't even kissed, and he is sometimes tempted to hold her hand. 

But the real action starts when Scott gets his eye on pretty Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, and Ramona seems to like Scott also. But Scott soon finds out that he has to fight and defeat Ramona's 7 evil former lovers if she is to be his.

The first couple of fights are interesting but it soon became more of the same. I found myself just waiting for them to be over so I could see where the new romance might go.

Not really my kind of movie. And I am not a big Michael Cera fan.

Im going to keep it short and get straight to the point. This movie is not for everyone, the younger crowd of teenagers will probably enjoy this film for all the flashy animated scenes and references a lot more as apposed to a 40 year old, who wont completely understand the comic book style setting, and think of it as childish. In the same breath this movie cannot be mistaken for an animated style children's movie. There are some openly gay sexually related references that don't seem to fit into the over all bigger picture at all. The movie jumps around quite a bit not really knowing what age group its trying to target. Often i'd find myself thinking i'm watching a movie that would appeal only to a 14 year old girl, and at other times i would feel like the movie just isn't appropriate for the younger crowd at all. The film doesn't seem to have much of a lasting appeal and no message that its trying to convey. The whole movie is built up on many quirky one liners and the characters don't really seem to fit there role. I've never seen so many woman chase after a bunch of nerds in the fashion that this movie portrays. It almost feels like they were the ones who wrote the script, and if you're not a comic book fanatic, you might not enjoy this movie as much as what you would have hoped. the only good aspect of this movie would be pretty, flashy camera work. Other than that this movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who made it through high school. The movie just tries too hard to be "cool". If you're looking for a good story, lasting appeal and clever script, give this one a miss.

I guess I am not the age demographic that this film is based at but I liked it. My daughter loves it, she even made me by her the DVD.

Scott Pilgrim is a magical realism/fantasy teen comedy with pop art video game visuals. Deep in its heart its just a hip, flashy teen romantic comedy.

Edgar Wright better known as the director of the Cornetto Trilogy adapts this comic book series like it was an edgy fast paced pseudo Japanese video game.

Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) plays bass in his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who meets his dream girl Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who is new in town. However he is soon pursued by Ramona's seven evil exes who all challenge Scott Pilgrim to a duel and Scott needs to keep them in check with his zaps and zingers Streetfighter style.

Cera has the right balance of geeky, slacker dude, Canadian hipster charm as Scott Pilgrim who is very likable even though he quickly ditched High School student Knives for Ramona.

The Evil Exes are a colourful bunch with some star names amongst them. Chris Evans is a skateboarding movie star whose entrance is accompanied with the Universal Pictures theme tune. Jason Schwartzman is a megalomaniac record producer. Brandon Routh is a pretentious vegan rock star with the ability to fly just like Superman.

There is a lot of scene stealing in this film like Kieran Culkin as Scott's sneaky gay roommate, Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister and particularly Ellen Wong as Knives the slightly too young ditched girlfriend who is still loyal to Scott.

I actually found this to be a fast moving, quirky, rocking, enjoyable comedy drama.

Scott Pilgrim V. The World

Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a young-ish (maybe 23) bassist of an underwhelming garage band, Sex Bomb...err, Sex Bomb-omb...with a lifelong hobby  no OBSESSION  of video games. His life is secure. He is involved in a sexless relationship with a minor: video game enthusiast, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). And his hard working roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) pays for everything, including their apartment. 

Pilgrim's life is basically unchallenged till, one evening, he dreams that some mysterious girl is out there. And, a bit later, it turns out that she is! Her name is Ramona Flowers, the American with no money worries, a big apartment, and no significant other hanging around.

Scott sees this as a chance to upgrade his relationship status. Besides, Ramona and he seem to connect. But, the illusion of Ramona's trouble-free availability changes as quickly, and as often as her hair color. Soon, Scott learns that he must overcome Romona's exes...err, SEVEN EVIL EXES...as well as his naïve world view in order to hook up with the girl of his dreams.

But, alas, life is a video game!...so, anything is possible. That naivety thing is tough, though.

This is a touchstone film. It speaks to the generation of the characters it highlights as well as bespeaks of them. (For this article, I'll call them the GENERATION.) It joins other touchstones such as Love Story, Brian's Song, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Clueless...and, much further into the past, Les Quatre Cents Coup. As with the first three of those films, it got very little critical acclaim when it was released. And unlike all of those films, it was a financial dud when it was released, during the middle of the Great Recession. But it garnered much critical mention as time went on from original viewers, as they learned to speak for themselves...as well as many DVD buys.

Scott Pilgrim V. the World was directed by Edgar Wright, the English director of Shawn of the Dead. It's based on the unfinished  at the time of the film's release  graphic novel by Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley. How much this has to do with O'Malley's personal life, I am uncertain. (But that is a major topic many of the GENERATION debate.) It does seem to be a collaboration between O'Malley and Wright, however. The supporting characters have a lot of substance to them...a substance that isn't present in other Edgar Wright films. 

These characters have a Scorsese feel to them. Chris Evan's Lucas Lee, one of the Seven Evil Execs, generates enough interest to have his own film, much less the minor role he plays here. Mark Webber's Stephen Stills, is also a stand out as a supporting character, the leader of the band.

Scott Pilgrim is a drama-edy/fantasy. While Love Story, Brian's Song and Quatre Cents had more social perspective, Scott Pilgrim shares with Clueless the success of replicating the language of the GENERATION. And the video game world that Scott Pilgrim created puts it up there with Ferris Bueller as showing a lifestyle that the GENERATION wants to lead. (The REAL question is if THE GENERATION is caught in the same delusion that Pilgrim is...not if they can IMAGINE their way out of it.)

Of the bunch, I liked Quatre Cents and Clueless the most. But I haven't sat down to watch any of them in sometime. This is the first time that I've seen the Scott Pilgrim in awhile. As with all touchstone films, you need to be in the mood to see it. And, no matter how well it's made, these films always lose their immediacy after the first year.

Strangely enough, two co-workers from the GENERATION had viewed V. The World the same day that I had, and it became the topic of conversation that workday. They had seen it a month prior, too. It's obvious that this film will be the topic for the rest of their lives - as all touchstone films should be.

I honestly wanted to like this movie because I liked Michael Cera's work in other titles like Youth in Revolt. However he often seems to be typecast as the lovable loser and in this film it just did not work for him, leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable.

The plot centres around his character Scott Pilgrim who is struggling to make his band a success and get over a bad break up a year before. He dates a high school girl 5 years younger for a while before being attracted to the cliché unapproachable new girl in town with the mysterious past. She is obviously way out of his league but seems attracted to him as a rebound because he seems sweet and shy and all her exes were evil. Even though this is obviously not a recipe for a lasting relationship he follows her like a poor lost puppy, cheating on his poor lost girlfriend. Eventually he dumps his girlfriend so him and the new girl he knows nothing about can live happily ever after. However surprisingly there is a catch in the form of the 7 evil exes he has to defeat to win her hand. Notice it says 7 evil exes not just ex boyfriends. This is because a tired 'I kissed a girl and I kind of liked it' moment is dragged out in a desperate attempt to stop you losing interest, it doesn't work.

Through the fight scenes the film makes hackneyed points like 'self respect is stronger than love' using ham-fisted video game metaphors you'll be bored of before the action even starts.

This might work as a game but not a film, the story and the characters are so superficial and two dimensional that the only true stars are the special effects and Ramona's cool hair.

The game sequence's are not the really unrealistic bit, that comes with the human relationships. During the final fight, Scott finally casually admits "I cheated on both of you. I'm really sorry...so are we all good?" And they are! So he gets to screw over everyone and get his sappy ending. Wait, I thought this was supposed to be a feel good movie? In conclusion I found the movie and especially the ending disappointing. There were a few fun moments but not enough to make it worth watching.

All i knew about this film prior to watching it is that he has Michael Cera doing the main role. It may mean nothing to some, but those who had seen movies starring Cera before might get a clue or two. And i don't mean it strictly in a good way.

Actually, since i first saw Michael in Superbad, he had one stable trait about his characters... they are all the same. Literally. He's always this kinda shy and awkward, nerdy but at the same time sorta streetwise type of guy of undefinable age, the one you wouldn't hate straight away but who you still wouldn't envy even if he got the hottest babe in the show. And if we add his constant grimace of a puppy who just sh@t himself a moment ago and is all sorry about that, i would expect his puppy charms to wear off rather quickly and the frustration to take over.

But at the same time, no matter how single-dimensional Michael's characters are, this "i'm shy and gentle" trick almost never fails to work. It definitely worked in Superbad, where Michael Cera and Jonah Hill duet played some Kyle&Eric sort of magic which, with help of other characters like legendary McLovin, made the film equally fun, deep and touching. In Juno, it was Ellen Page's turn to fill Cartman's place, which she did brilliantly, which also added to the film's overall success.

Here, in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there's no single teammate whom Michael Cera's character of a guy with a complicated approach to relationships could play along. Instead, there's a whole bunch of friends, foes and love interests who swirl around him in a sick (in a good way) mix of garage rock, 8-bit games and comic book extravaganza. Which means, this time Michael has to prove that he can be a single locomotive for the big show.

The first 15 minutes of the film weren't too reassuring on this account. They are without a doubt visually creative, and this is probably the first time after Sin City that style does not only overcome substance but becomes a source of it. Yet, the character of Scott Pilgrim itself is what looks like a main drawback. I mean, our guy is still cute and naive, but there's something missing, some driving force that could turn that series of awkward and silly moments into something substantial.

And then the miracle happens. Once we finally get to know Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character of a femme who's literally fatale, the story gets a major kick up the butt, and apparently Scott's personality too, because he starts demonstrating will, determination and skills we never got to expect from Michael Cera's fragile and semi-vegetative characters. Can't say this transformation looks very natural, but naturality is the last thing one should expect from a movie that looks more a comic book than a typical cinema.

Maybe this visual surrealism is the main defining point of Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Because what might otherwise be somewhat bland and boring transforms into a unique sort of fun, something i never had a chance to experience since Kick-Ass and The Green Hornet, which was years ago for me. The action scenes are equally intense and bizarre, which makes them all the more unpredictable and satisfying.

Yet there's more to this film than just the action, visuals and the raw energetics of the whole performance. There's this trademark Canadian approach to life that this movie teems with: from the little comedic episodes, sketches and phrases to the characters to the whole entourage. Not as self-absorbed as the typical American everything, more willing to have a joke on itself, maybe even insecure in some ways, but still with enough soul to incur rather sympathy than abasement. As if the film plays its strengths and weaknesses open but relies on your good will to expect forgiveness rather than judgement.

This is the main message this movie sends us by its ending. That whoever we are and whatever we've done, the most important thing is to be able to accept ourselves and those who surround you. Not that big of a philosophical breakthrough, but still satisfying enough to leave a generally pleasant aftertaste. The same could be said about the movie as a whole. Very solid, with both the unique sides and the touching moments. Maybe not breaking enough rules nor touching enough sore spots to really stand out as a film to be remembered across generations. But aiming for that would be too pompous and pretentious, which isn't how they do things in Canada. After all, there's nothing wrong with just good ol' entertainment.

Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, based off the excellent graphic novel series is a spot-on roller-coaster of flash AND substance for fans of video games, the Scott Pilgrim comics or strip culture as a whole alike. The story of Scott Pilgrim's struggle for glory fighting his new girlfriend's seven evil ex-boyfriends to continue dating her doesn't have much going for it per se, but Scott's charming character, growing increasingly confident throughout the movie saves the movie story wise, as you really care for him. What's left is flashy, comic-book/video-game style action: if 1-up's and grotesque "POW" sound effects and a sick garage rock OST sound like your cup of tea, the whole movie will probably be worth its while for you, if not, don't even bother.

Good fun. Plot is quite basic but direction and special effects are very original and entertaining. Snappy, funny dialogue - screamingly funny at times. 

Does run out of steam and idea though, and should have ended about 20 minutes earlier.

Good performances all round. Michael Cera does his usual nerdy low-self- confidence routine, and does it well. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is spot-on and gorgeous as the love interest. Supporting cast are well chosen - Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, Jason Schwartzman, Alison Pill, Mark Webber, Ellen Wong.

...like a lot of Hollywood movies these days, SCOTT PILGRIM feels very insubstantial. So much money has been put on-screen to make it look good, with special effects popping out at you all the while and all manner of technical wizardry, that real, grounded storytelling and 'meat' has been left by the wayside. I appreciate the constant homages to geek culture and video games, but at the end of this film I was left feeling curiously unsatisfied.

The fight scenes, which pop up with an almost routine regularity, are spectacular. The choreography is often brilliant and the addition of the special effects is the icing on the cake. The film is colourful, fast-paced and quick witted with it. But what is there beyond the visual spectacle? The humour isn't all that. Michael Cera, who I've never seen before, is intensely irritating with that whiny, lispy little voice. It is possible to make geeky leading men likable (it happened with KICK-ASS) but Cera remains an irritant from beginning to end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is much better as the object of his affection, but if you're expecting romance you'll be disappointed; such moments are non-existent.

This is a flashy but ultimately unrewarding movie, something that jettisons proper plotting and character work in favour of a self-knowing, video game-style atmosphere throughout.

You know those YouTube videos where you get a laugh and they are really wild and crazy, but shitty? The ones made by young college kids that are into theater and entertainment and have the nerd skills to produce short little movies and publish them on the internet? Well this movie is like a long version of one of those. I can't say I enjoyed the movie though I did get a few laughs out of it. Unfortunately the movie is mostly boring and is peppered with cheap special effects that only a stoned person could appreciate. It looks like the writer(s) had this idea of making a movie play out like a video game, and just scribbled down the first story idea that came to mind and molded the movie to fit idea. I suspect they were high when came up with this movie. It was a good effort, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are really really bored and have nothing else to watch (like me). Enjoy...or, whatever.

Would be more entertaining. I've been reading the other reviews on here and I just can't understand for the life of me how this movie ranks at almost an 8/10. Yes, I realize people view graphic novels as capable delivery devices for quality literature. That doesn't warrant a 2 hour plot that jerks to each cutscene like some guy tripping on acid, waits to deliver any sort of message till the last half hour, then flip flops back and forth about 5 times right at the very end trying to appease everyone in the audience. Combine that with preteen concepts and daydreams of love & fighting and this whole thing was like The Wonder Years in a video game played by someone with severe ADD. This is by far not the masterpiece people made it out to be.

I won't lie, there were some funny bits just from the sheer nature of having the characters say random things for the entire 2 hours but there was nothing that even came close to the applause this movie has received. Originally, I wasn't going to watch this at all based on the trailer but I kept hearing good things so I gave it a shot.

Bottom line 

The Good: Funny bits, decent fight choreography, interesting cinematography choices integrating the comic book/video game world with reality, hot Asian chick 

The Bad: Extremely immature love story, random main character, laughable plot, terrible scene transition 

4/10, I recommend not seeing it to begin with but if you do make sure you do so with someone who gave this film an 8 so you can ask them to point out exactly what they were thinking

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Interesting game-mode movie, nice gameplay actually. The movie has fine content and its not a bad movie at all ... its done nicely but the story isn't as good as it could have been.... and neither its a movie that I will care to see again, not that I hated it.

Best character in the movie is Scott's ex. She is a real sweet heart. The music and editing are probably the best parts of the movie while the direction is fine and performances are OK too.

I'd recommend it to every one for a single watch. You might like it better than me.

What is wrong with you people in IMDb, how come this movie be 'brilliant' ?, The only thing that make me stick to my chair is the music. The story is stupid, yes i do have an imagination, but come on, the main character is too lame, so lame that make you hate him and wish the bad guy wins !.My kids Love Video Game and rock music, but this movie make them look like retard definitely. Where the story goes ? what purpose. If you are a teenage and planning on having some easy adventure through movie, trust me you wont get anything from this movie. And If you are an adult who loves this movie, trust me you should check your conscience. Don't watch this movie.
