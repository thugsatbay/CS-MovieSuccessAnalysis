### Seperation : (text, date, rating, summary, status, user_score, user_score_count) $$$ End of review 
Several years ago, a group of Los Angeles teenagers learned that they could easily break into the homes of celebrities, keeping tabs on their comings and goings online. This is their story, as told by Sofia Coppola. Coppola is one of my favorite modern directors. Her previous four films are generally about ennui-filled lives, and I can see what attracted her to this story about these vapid social media- and celebrity-obsessed kids feeding off the even more vapid celebrities (they even pick the most awful celebrities imaginable to victimize, like Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Megan Fox), but, in all honesty, this story just has no conflict whatsoever, and the little jackass teenagers who are at its center are so painfully uninteresting that, after spending half an hour with them, I really wanted to walk out of the theater. To boot, the plot is repetitive as Hell - teenagers break into house, teenagers steal baubles, teenagers drive away like idiots singing along with rap songs, teenagers do drugs, teenagers go out dancing. The film goes through this cycle like six times before the cops finally arrest them. The film is sometimes well shot (it was the last film shot by master cinematographer Henry Savides), and there's at least one killer sequence where the two main teens (Katie Chang and Israel Broussard) rob a glass house where it's shot from quite a distance (it's perhaps reminiscent of the glass apartments from Tati's Playtime - I don't know if Coppola had that in mind). The most recognizable stars in it are Harry Potter's Emma Watson and Leslie Mann, who plays her mom. I'd actually call this the worst film I've seen so far from 2013.

I saw an early screening of The Bling Ring and I have to say my expectations were not met, in fact the movie did not even come close to meeting them. When I heard that Emma Watson was going to be in a movie about a group of teenagers robbing rich celebrities I have to say I was intrigued. Add on top of that the fact that Sofia Coppola is the director, she also made the excellent Lost in Translation, and I was guaranteed to be seeing it sometime in theaters.

The film is based on the true story of a group of teenagers that lived in or around Calabasas, California. Sometime during the period of October 2008 through August 2009 the group, called the "Bling Ring", stole about $3 million in cash and belongings from celebrities including Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, and Lindsay Lohan.

It is a fascinating story and one that sounds like a terrific setup for a film but the execution is terribly bland. If you have watched the trailer for the film it seems like it is going to be an insane mashup of partying scenes and what most people are going to be looking forward to Emma Watson and her friends robbing celebrities left and right. These scenes are in the movie but in the film they are not exciting or insane in any way. The robbing scenes all start off with the group looking up the celebrities house on the internet and then finding out if they are out of town or not. They then proceed to just drive up to the house, get out, walk up the driveway, walk around the house trying to open doors, and then when they find an unlocked one just walk right into the house. The filming is so lazy and simple that these scenes are as exciting as watching your neighbor unlock his front door and go inside after coming home from work. Then the actual robbing parts are just the group picking up the celebrities valuables and then constantly saying "Oh my god this looks hot!" Repeat this process for a good 20 times and you have the first 3/4 of the entire movie.

The characters in the film are based on the actual teenagers but their names have been changed. Contrary to the film's marketing selling Emma Watson as the main character she is actually not the ringleader of the group. Instead it is a girl named Rebecca played by Katie Chang. The film centers on Rebecca and her best friend Marc played by Israel Broussard. Their acting is so average and their interactions are so boring that it is hard to care for them at all. In fact the only above average performance in the movie is from Emma Watson and surprisingly she only plays a small role in the film until the end of the movie.

Altogether I am not sure who The Bling Ring was made for. The intended audience appeared to be teenagers but with a R-rating most of that audience is unable to pay to see it. But at the same time it cannot be for this group because the film tries so hard to be artistic. Case in point one of the heist scenes is a continuous shot of the exterior of a house while the characters are running around inside of it for a good four minutes. So the film is too slow to be for teenagers with small attention spans but it is not relatable or intelligent enough for anyone in their 20's or older. And as for those Emma Watson fans they should be prepared to be disappointed because she is not even on screen for a large portion of the movie.

The Bling Ring is a missed opportunity as it could have been an exciting teenage heist film but is instead a film that tries to be artsy and drags on for way too long. If you have to see it rent it on DVD but otherwise you will not be missing anything.

Sofia please stop. Just for a second and consider that for those of us who are less privileged than yourself - spending 10 Euros to see a film is a lot of money. Asking us to sit in and watch your film for 90 minuteswell that is also quite a lot of time to ask. We (yes it was a group of us) found your film to be lazy, boring and superficial.

At the start of the film it's declared that the film was based on a Vanity Fair article  which says it all. It felt like the vanity fair article, google, TMZ and YouTube were the only source of research for this poor script. 

Sofia seemed to approach this film with the same degree of snideness and holier than though attitude that I'm sure that same article evoked. You cannot judge your characters negatively and then write about them. As a result what you get is a bunch of shallow, one dimensional characters like the ones I had to endure for so long. 'That's the point'  you may say  'they are one dimensional, they are shallow'. Well I looked up Emma Watsons real life character on YouTube  she had much more depth than what Emma led us to believe and I was far more intrigued by her than what was presented on screen. Instead Sofia wants us just to laugh at these people - distance ourselves from them, put our behaviour above them as well, that's easy and it's wrong.

For anyone reading this I implore you to wait to watch this on an outlet that doesn't involve you wasting any of your hard earned money because it's not worth it. I can promise you that. The story is about a bunch of girls who seem obsessed in acquiring a celebrity lifestyle through any means. We follow them rob houses, post things on facebook, have silly conversations everywhere, driving, getting drunk and generally playing cartoon characters. Everything is so easy and inconsequential. The acting is so, so poor. The story is thin and lazily handled. Little effort, be it staging, pace, thought, editing has been invested into making this into any kind of legitimate film worth thinking about. It actually made me bored  then angry  hence why I am venting through IMDb.

We mustn't also forget that the director  Ms Coppola has a bag line  yes, a bag line with Louis Vuittonerm just be weary of this when you next go to see her many films about empty lives. I get that its best to write what you know  but do it in an interesting, profound, humane way  otherwise please don't bother.

This movie probably lacks everything you want out of a good movie. To begin with there is no proper story, 90% of the movie is just kids playing around with shoes and bags, the characters are never really established or properly evolved, they are just there, doing things. The acting is dull and the dialogs are annoying, I'm not sure if this was intended to portray the bland L.A. wannabe lifestyle or just poor writing and acting, either way, it's boring to watch. You will also most likely want to slap some of these kids for being so vain and stupid. The directing is good, not great, but good, and I like the colour schemes in most of the scenes which gave the sense of the washed-out pictures you find on Tumblr and Pinterest. There isn't much action here either, you'd think in a movie about robbery would have some cool Ocean's 11 type sequences or something but not, none of that, most of the time the scene just cuts to when they are already in the house partying. The court trial at the end is also mashed up into a silly 5 second sequence where the court room door opens and closes. Emma Watson, is isn't the lead, is overly in focus through out the movie in a more than obvious attempt to sell her celebrity, in a movie like this, I just found that ironic. In short watch this if you want to see teenage girls play around with designer shoes and handbags.

Only one word can describe this movie: boring. I imagine there are plenty of indie-loving, artsy types that loved it but I found it very dull. There were a lot of nonsensical scenes that had no point and didn't add to the story at all. One in particular saw the male lead dancing and smoking weed in front of a night visioned camera by himself for a good 2 minutes. Don't ask me what the purpose of that was; I just don't know. The movie was sloppily cut and jarring in it's transitions at times. Not to mention repetitive. How many times can you watch this group of kids break in to Paris Hilton's house and try on hats? The only saving grace was Emma Watson. She played her character's self-centered, shallow, vapid nature with subtle believability. Other than that, I'd say avoid this movie at all costs. The level of boredom it conjures is mind-numbing at best.

It was based on an article and it feels like an article stretched out into a film. 

I'm a fan of Sofia's work but this is crap. Incredibly two dimensional and the point of the film is established almost immediately and then drawn out from there. I understand what the film was trying to do but it did it in an exceptionally boring way. 

Saw this in theaters and would have walked out if the ticket didn't cost so much. 

Enough films about this Beverly Hills rich kid wanna-be celebrity lifestyle. It's incredibly boring. 

Of the films I've seen this year, this is the worst. Spring breakers is a very close second.

Sofia Coppola gets it, she gets this social media generation. How do I know? I'm part of it. I know girls like this; the types that don't believe something exists unless it's been posted on their Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. In her latest film The Bling Ring, Coppola gives us a vibrant portrait of a society thats culture is so lost it's hard to decide who you hate more; wannabes or celebrities.

I was lucky enough to attend an early screening of The Bling Ring tonight and if there's one word I could use to describe this film it would be: precise. Every edit intricately planned to have a purpose. Upon the first time viewing I don't blame people for missing it. The Bling Ring is intentionally scattered, as if the film itself had a serious case of ADD. The attention span of the edit is about as long as the attention span of our narrators. At times when the narrative shifts focus from one character to another the edit changes with them. If you watch it closely you can almost see the film as a thought process, how each character relives the crimes.

I loved the way this film was shot. It's interesting, the way we view these characters is almost in the background, as if we the audience are in fact the surveillance camera we remain distant from the people on screen not understanding what drives them or even feeling the thrill of robberies. Don't get me wrong there is tension, but only at very interesting times that aren't because of the fear of the robbery. Even scenes where they are almost caught are shown to us very flat trying to detach us from the characters as much as possible.

I've always appreciated Sofia's slow moving dolly shots and they work stunningly in this film. Rarely does a seemingly static shot hold an audiences attention, especially one that takes place outside the house that's being robbed; thanks to the sound design the low ominous tones, as subtle as they are, really drive the scenes.

Emma Watson is fantastic. The way she portrays Nicki's vacant need to fulfill her meaningless desires was striking and the accent and voice inflections made the performance all the more impressive. Besides Emma, most of the other girls are forgettable which I enjoyed; at times you can confuse them with one another because they try so hard to be the same style of person.

Another thing I loved is the amount of "selfies" these girls take. As Coppola herself said it's as if "your experiences don't count unless you have an audience watching them" and you can really feel that in this film. None of the characters really have any "moments" despite their attempts at proving it.

Overall I really enjoyed the film. The entire thing feels like this giant master plan that will need multiple viewing to take in everything Coppola was trying to say. While not as surprising as I thought it was going to be the themes explored near the end of the film were worth the fabulously detailed ride we knew to expect from the trailer.

The Bling Ring is a unique social commentary, which on the surface layer is bound to be compared to Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers, both giving us their take on sociopathic young teens. Where the films differ thematically is the interesting part. You'll have to figure that one out on your own.

Sofia Coppola is one of the most interesting and divisive filmmakers working today. It seems that with every new film she releases there's always a wide array of responses, both positive and negative. And that's very true with her new film, The Bling Ring. Some love it, and some loathe it. I personally enjoyed it very much, and the more I think about it, the more I like it and would maybe even see it again. It's an interesting and atmospheric look at American celebrity and media culture that bleakly shows how we can think being rich and famous can make us "happy." 

The film is based on a Vanity Fair article about how in 2008, a group of Californian teenagers (4 girls & 1 boy) stole millions-of-dollars worth of clothing and jewelry and possessions from celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox, and others. It's a stranger-than- fiction kind of story that could lend itself to exploitation, satire, or even heavy-handed moralizing, but Coppola distances herself from the lurid material and simply displays it as a set of facts. It's a cold, deadpan film, but there's several fascinating moments of insight and darkly funny commentary that make it interesting. It's been compared to Harmony Korine's similar film "Spring Breakers," which also features several young girls trying to experience the media's view of what a fun Spring Break is. Whereas that film is knowingly repetitive in its dialogue and images and very violent and exploitative to get its point across, Coppola goes for a more restrained and almost documentary type of style. In fact, there's several instances where the main action is interrupted and we see scenes of the characters being interviewed after the events or TMZ-like celebrity news stories. 

The Bling Ring is benefited by its central young actors who give strong, naturalistic performances that feel so live-in that they give an improvisational feel. The leaders of the Bling Ring are Marc (Israel Broussard) and Rebecca (Katie Chang). Marc is the quiet, insecure gay kid who soon is taken under the wing of Rebecca, who's troubled yet confident and cold-as-ice. Broussard is charming and subtly sympathetic and Chang is hyper-perceptive, smart, and cold but not without a conscience. There's Chloe (Claire Julien), the loud and outgoing one in the group. Then there's sisters Sam (Taissa Farmiga) and Nicki (Emma Watson). It's interesting seeing Watson in a supporting role since she's arguably the most famous out of the central gang, but it pays off because of Nicki's larger-than-life, self-absorbed Valley Girl personality. Watson is the scene-stealer of the film with her smart and satirical performance that never goes over-the-top and always feels real, which makes the character that much more misguided and tragic. It's early to say something like this, but it's a performance that deserves some Best Supporting Actress recognition. Also very good and inspired here is the always funny Leslie Mann, who plays the flighty mom of Sam and Nicki and teaches them the ever so spiritual teachings of "The Secret." There's a scene near the end of the film between Watson and Mann that is just pure, dark comedy gold. 

The plot mostly consists of the gang clubbing, breaking into houses, driving around, and trying on clothes. It sounds repetitive, and well, technically it is. But Coppola distinguishes each break-in with its own tone and style and you can very subtly see how the characters change as they become more and more comfortable with invading the houses. For example, the break-in of Audrina Patridge's house is all done in one, long take from outside, across the street as Marc and Rebecca rummage through all her things and run from room-to-room and eventually leave. Another break-in finds Sam cluelessly waving around Megan Fox's pistol without a care in the world. And one of the film's most telling and haunting shots comes when the gang is inside Lindsay Lohan's house and Rebecca stares at the mirror and smiles so genuinely that it almost seems like that's the happiest she's ever been. It's a truly disturbing and haunting moment and the film is full of subtle images that let you into the characters' psyche and ego. 

But the glue that holds the film together is the dynamic between Marc and Rebecca. There's several poignant and moving moments between the two characters that cut through the film like a knife and let you into the ultimately empty and sad feelings the two characters have. Their scenes and dialogue are so sharply drawn that it reminds you just how gifted of a writer Coppola is as well. 

So this movie just worked for me. It's not a film that's trying to dig deep into it's subject, and it's not even really interested in telling you all of the details about this group of young robbers. It's ultimately this odd, off-kilter tone poem that's beautiful to look at and at times surprisingly poignant and hilarious. (And lastly I'd like to mention the great and legendary work of cinematographer Harris Savides, who, during shooting this film, passed away from brain cancer. The film is dedicated to him.)

Sexy girls (+ the alibi loser) break into celebrity villas, steal from them, get caught, go to jail. Most of the film I was just waiting that they would be eventually get caught. Instantly Harmony Korine's Spring breakers springs to mind. His film was much more innovative and riskier. The hedonistic lifestyle needs a bold approach and in The Bling ring it was not a roar but rather a meow. Korine's approach had quite a similar storyline but because probably because of the boldness of his film it was much more engaging. Also the characters in The Bling Ring stayed one-dimensional: super-confident and defining themselves through sex, clothes, looks, tattoos etc. The problem with such a one dimensional characterisation is that that they all become too predictable and the story becomes boring. We had the doubting boy and then super-confident girls and that dynamics played out exactly the same through the whole film. I see the point of the film showing the girls empowered through their superficial qualities and driving the break ins. Girl power gone in the wrong direction. No doubt it's an important development in society but using these cardboard characterisations creates a pretty boring film. Harmonie Korine's film was much better by taking the hedonism and multiplying it by 100 and having a story which turns more and more absurd to the end (girl power multiplied by 100). Overall the Bling Ring did everything wrong what Spring Breakers did bang on.

The collective level of vapidity on display in the Bling Ring might (like totally) reach epic proportions.

Award-winning, insightful director, Sofia Coppola, has once again made a film that is highly successful in portraying fame and celebrity ... only this time she has turned the cameras onto those who obsess over and covet the fame and celebrity others have.

The Bling Ring is a character study/meditation of a group of people -- based on real life individuals in SoCal -- with NO character whatsoever. They are all beautiful bling on the outside with no inner core of morality. They are shells of a mass emptiness who worship others for merely having stuff they want ... or being on their TVs.

Coppola's story is based on real-life events of a group of five vacuous and insipid teenagers (one boy and four girls) who used the internet to track the whereabouts of their "celebrity" idols -- some were merely "reality stars" -- so that when the stars were out of town the five could play. The five would break into celeb houses and play with beautiful things that belonged to Paris Hilton, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom, Audrina Patridge or ... their ultimate idol, Lindsay Lohan. They also ended up pocketing and stealing a lot of designer goods and merchandise (you know, like to wear and be cool with). They had fun and bragged about their shenanigans at parties and on social media all the while believing that they had done nothing wrong. One even believes this happened in order for her to become more charitable -- her comment on "karma" must be heard to be believed. Coppola wisely lifted this line word-for-word as it is tragic comic gold.

Emma Watson (Harry Potter, Perks of Being a Wallflower) is the most-recognizable face in the cast and she totally has the film's bestest lines! Watson is a genius comedienne ... who knew? Her line delivery and depiction of oblivious shame are perfect.

Coppola understands the world of fame and she has proved she also understand the world of those who dream of it. This isn't a movie in which characters learn life lessons and change ... this is a depiction of people who believe they do no wrong (like never ever). It is eye-opening because these people walk amongst us. The film is full of face palm, jaw drop and eye rolling moments. Like ... a lot. Totally.

I prepared myself for the glitzy superficial clubbing and personality of all the characters in the movie, and I made an excuse for that, it was the medium for the film's plot, setting, and the base event. However, it does not excuse the poor production of this film. I prepared myself to dislike many of the character's personalities and not to personally relate to them. Yet, beyond the proper medium, there were no characters. In the beginning we are introduced to Marc, who explains that he has suffered from depression, anxiety, and poor self esteem- clichéd, but whatever, yet it never ties into the plot ever again. The "antagonist" Rebecca, supposedly a sociopathic beauty, is introduced in common fashion, but no depth is ever given to her. Marc and Rebecca become friends, and although Marc clearly states that he is only at alternative school for absences, on their first "date" (because they pull the stereotypical gay card on Marc as well, so we aren't quite sure on his preferences)he is automatically going from troubled new kid to thief and felon. The plot never ties in, period, and furthermore, Marc's character only serves as a "pity" pitch at the audience, with the idea that if they present a kid who wasn't already an allegorical "Axis" power, then the conclusion will be more compelling when Rebecca, the sociopathic leader, is caught. The only premise of Rebecca being "unhinged" is her petty theft and binge shopping lifestyle. This movie had the potential to document a case that's a bit scary in reality-everyone has access to anything these days. Marc's only purpose to Rebecca is looking up addresses on Google Maps. Yep. Not a computer hacker. No tracking devices. Google Maps. He is, essentially, a worthless character. None of the plot points quite tie together-later in the movie, after Marc's mention of how he was "insecure" of how "ugly" he felt, we see that not a few weeks or so after he met Rebecca, he's prancing around in Prada heels.v I do not have a problem with this. I DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MALES BEING FEMININE. I have a problem with the inconsistency in the plot, because he mentions that the only reason he got involved with all of the larceny was because he felt "anxious, depressed, and ugly." Yes, I am aware of what all those can lead a person to, but mind you, we are never opened to Marc's "vulnerable" side. We hear during his narration about 5 times about how he was "convoluted" in thought, but for a majority of the film, there is no conflict affecting him. He does not give two shits. He was enjoying himself just as much as Rebecca, Nikki, and the others were. There are several mentions of him being nervous in the houses of Paris Hilton or Orlando Bloom, which I guess was a ploy at making him appear self conscious about his actions-but in reality he wasn't sorry for what he did, he just didn't want to get caught. It had nothing to do with remorse, it was all about retribution. He mentioned one time, after the security video of Audrina Partidge's robbery was released, that they should stop. Not for the good of the others, but because someone NOTICED. Even at the end of the film, his "justified" personality lies about knowing where Rebecca was. I know characters are flawed, humans are flawed, but the set up for this character was done by a panel of drunk monkeys. Nothing adds up! As for all the others? Rebecca is not given enough analysis to be a convincing or dangerous presence in the film's world. Emma Watson (I love her, this is quite painful to say) sounds a bit mechanical, her valiant attempt at America ditz was honorable but stinted emotionally. Taissa Farmiga, not given much screen time but I laud her for the scene she did with the gun. I can't remember if her character was drunk (most likely) but I even felt nervous when she started pushing people around. Much conviction in her..."unbalanced" style of acting. Overall this movie was...pretty disappointing. What's supposed to be a case film is mainly an hour or so of dancing on poles, stealing clothes, clubbing, and snorting coke.

The Bling Ring (2013)

First, what this is: a re-creation of a series of actual robberies by spoiled rich high school girls of spoiled adult celebrities in the L.A. area. They do the crimes, they get caught. This is evident from the beginning with some interviews after the fact.

Second, what this is: nothing more than the above. That's the big big problem here. This feature length movie re-creates and re-creates. 

We see these indifferent, superficial girls in house after house (and in Paris Hilton's house a lot), trying on clothes and jewelry and taking home whatever they want by the purse-load. And we see all the parties between, party after party. Some with drugs, some without, all with music and dancing and utter detachment from consequences and culpability. 

I guess that's the point, to make visible this world and make clear how really repulsive such prettified, well dressed, fashion imitation girls can be. This is the territory of Lauren Greenfield's photographic essay in the book "Fast Forward," but with a very specific focus on this group of half a dozen girls (and one boy who is sort of sucked in by his willingness to fawn and give attention).

There is zero attention to really what makes these girls tick. A very slim attempt is made at showing they have no true education, and no acculturation beyond fashion magazines. But really, what are these girls about? Where are there jealousies, their aspirations, their sex lives, their doubts? The movie is as superficial as the subject, and for Sofia Coppola that's a real shame and inexcusable, as if she just got lazy. Not that making a movie like this is easy, but someone somewhere should have said, hey, look, this amounts to nothing at all. 

Where are there comparables beyond Greenfield (whose book has its own flaw of making glorious what she apparently means to critique)? Larry Clark's "Kids" is one place to consider (or his other films, which deal with youth more disturbingly). Or maybe the even more horrible "Murder in Greenwich" which dealt with the East Coast version of spoiled kids losing their bearings (and at least created a plot you could follow with some curiosity). 

Coppola has gone this direction before in "The Virgin Suicides" and there she created a semblance of depth. Not this time. And the spoiled title character in "Marie Antoinette" gave her at least a fascinating subject, which she layered up in really compelling ways. And to be sure this isn't "Lost in Translation" (her masterpiece) in any manner. These are all written and directed by Coppola.

If you are the type of person who recoils at the Paris Hilton antics, skip this movie. This is a bunch of wannabe Hiltons and you don't feel sorry for anyone, perpetrator or victim. You just hope it ends fast.

This had some promise and I kept thinking as the movie dragged on that I would find some sort of redeeming quality or that the plot would present itself and I would suddenly understand why people could have like the movie. That never happened.

*Spoilers from here on* This was a very terrible movie. I don't recommend anyone see it. Mindless repetition of teens trying on and looking at clothes inside celebrity houses and then them partying inside the club. For over an hour. Then you get the trial and a few interviews that add nothing to the plot and it is over. The best part is when it is finally over and you can do anything else with your life.

Seriously if you can think of anything else you might want to do please save yourself and chose that other thing.

it just another movie portraying the drinking and extreme drug use culture in America (LA especially). Just about them breaking into the house of celebrities and then get arrested and went to jail. The end. If you read this, it'll only take 1 minute instead of wasting 90 minutes of your life. Poor acting from the actors too so it's just so bad. I know most people watch this just because of Emma and that's just pathetic because Emma was just whatever, well she stepped out of her "shell" of Hermione, but nothing special. I think this movie is garbage and just shouldn't have even been made into a movie really. Stupid. Last but not least, I warn everyone to not watch this. :)

The Bling Ring is a stunningly shot, visually entertaining film that strives to make a statement about materialism and young teens' fame obsessions. Unfortunately, Sofia Coppola fails to translate her vision into a substantiated plot that develops a story and protagonists; neither of which, are worth caring about. Aside from Emma Watson's intimidating performance, the acting is sub-par which aids in the instantaneous transition from Coppola's attempts to create a smart, creative film to a shallow, unsatisfactory film that feels quite unfinished. The idea of The Bling Ring is fresh, however you cannot help but ignore the large lack of intellectual Bling, the film once promised or Coppola might have hoped for.

Yeah this is a dismal misfire. Worse it shows a new Coppola that I'll be avoiding in the future. I say this as someone who can get excited for a project like this, one that embraces youth without sugarcoating the folly and pretensions, that brings a genuine curiosity to a vibrant worldin short something like Spring Breakers that in the thuggish lifestyle finds room for reflection.

This is a superficial look at superficial people, and I mean superficial in what Coppola sees of them. For what it's worth she decided to delve into these lives, apparently inspired by real events. The real events are not a concern here, they are always a springboard for our cinematic journey. She decided to bring these people into focus for us to see, at least so far as she could see into them. 

And what does she see? A flaky, rootless youth that has not worked to create its world, that emptily covets expensive trinkets and finds them by merely walking through the door and grabbing stuff. This isn't just about these four individuals who sneak into celebrities' homes, it is a broader look at instagram culture. Naturally.

What's worse is that Coppola has not found some inner space where souls feebly try to know each other and participate, how stealing fabrics can be a search for the identity of what to wrap around self. I'm not saying they should have been shown as troubled romantics. Looking at my youth I recognize a lot of superficial obsessions with unimportant things, it comes with being young and just throwing yourself at this or that current, but I also recognize that as inadvertent part of a larger floating sense of everything feeling doable and airy, which is the essence of youthfulness.

It's what Korine brings to Spring Breakers and feels transcendent, the free wandering of mind.

Coppola tries to show some of that, for instance in the scenes of partying where time ecstatically slows, but is constantly bogged down by the surly need to press on with their neuroses and vacant desires. She adopts a catty and empty look because in her eyes they are merely catty and empty people. There's too much judgement here and not enough intuitive understanding of subtler pulls.

In the future I expect her to be torn to shreds for this one film. How is it that her Marie Antoinette, obviously modeled after her own self, can be shown wistfully in spite of the sheltered privilege as a quietly suffering soul but not these girls? It's a worthless film and even manages to reduce everything else she's done.

The Bling Ring often reminds me of the days when there was no TV. Because that's the time I wanted to return to after watching this pathetic disgrace to the film industry. It had shoddy direction and terrible acting particularly on the part of Emma Watson, not because she didn't play the part well, but because the character she was playing gave me a migraine just to hear speaking. I am also deeply disappointed by the ratings it didn't deserve which will trap any unknowing movie goer in this pit of movie hell. It had no plot or story-line whatsoever. You could have easily sat on a keyboard and written the script, probably better. It makes me feel no sympathy or compassion for the main characters. It made me cringe just to continue looking. All this movie shows us are spoiled teenagers ruining their lives. Congratulations. It has accomplished as much as Lindsay Lohan's criminal record.

A quick summary of this utter monstrosity: 

0-10 minutes: OMG (insert celebrity) is away, let's go rob his/her house. Look at all this stuff! Let's go to the club. Trying on various items the next day

10-20 minutes: OMG (insert celebrity) is away, let's go rob his/her house. Look at all this stuff! Let's go to the club. Trying on various items the next day

20-30 minutes: OMG (insert celebrity) is away, let's go rob his/her house. Look at all this stuff! Let's go to the club. Trying on various items the next day

30-40 minutes: OMG (insert celebrity) is away, let's go rob his/her house. Look at all this stuff! Let's go to the club. Trying on various items the next day

40-45 minutes: "I'm starting to get worried about being caught." "Shut up, you dork."

45-55 minutes: "I'm leaving because I miss my Dad. Bye."

55-65 minutes: Search warrants and arrest.

65-70 minutes: Court case blah blah blah you've been charged blah blah blah

70-the end: Err... a lot of crying... and cameras and stuff... there isn't really any footage of them being in jail. The movie ends with a cheesy, confusing, and pointless anecdote from Emma Watson.

So there you have it: this movie summed up in a few quick points. Guys, if you're here for Emma Watson, just save yourself the time and just go for an image search like everyone else. Girls, you might enjoy the various handbags and shoes that get some screen time, but I would strongly advise you to just watch something else... especially if you want to see a good movie as well as various handbags and shoes.

Overall: 9/100

'The Bling Ring' is definitely a film where I would say don't even bother watching it, it is just incredibly dull and boring.

I saw the rating was quite low but I wanted to give it a chance anyway because I really like Emma Watson (good performance, only reason I gave it 3/10 instead of 1/10) and the plot seemed interesting.

It was a disappointment, there is no real plot, there is no character development. This group of people just come together very quickly, some of them just by chance. Then they decide to start robbing places, they go in all discreetly, then just find a key under the front door mat, play around with clothes and handbags for a while and then walk out like nothing has happened and post pictures online for the world to see. This is just plain stupid.

I feel it was a good idea but just poorly done. I wouldn't recommend this at all.

3/10.

At first I was optimistic about this film. However purely for Harry Potter star, Emma Watson's sake. Which proved me naive. I made it only 48 minutes into the movie and that was with great difficulty. The movie is extremely repetitive which made it tedious and boring to watch. At one point during the film there is a scene that goes for at least 2 minutes where the lead male character is smoking and dancing in front of a webcam. I still don't know if there was any reasoning or point behind that scene... What felt like the exact same scene was being repeated scene after scene,teens stalk celebs whereabouts, teens break in, teens ransack the house, teens run away in the shadows of the night, teens sing along to bad rap music, teens smoke and party, over and over and over. One will want to hold out, keep watching, praying that surely something interesting is about to happen. But trust me, it's not. If you make it past the 48 minute mark, all the power to you.

Possibly the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. 98% of the film is a bunch of kids playing with shoes and clothes and 'partying' - even though they're what about 13? So unbelievable and such bad acting.. I am surprised it has even reached 2 stars on ratings let alone 5. the movie has no real story line and who ever wrote this is clearly living in la la land. I bet even Emma Watson is embarrassed. I would rather watch a snail move across a football pitch than have to watch this movie again. Or even a snail crawling across the Sahara desert.. or perhaps the movie would have been more interesting if it was about snails. I would have rated it 0 stars if possible.

This film is for very lazy sundays. It has precisely zero twists in it. Teens rob houses. That's it. That is actually it. Nothing ever happens, you don't like the characters, you can't sympathize with them. You can learn absolutely nothing watching this movie. I guess if you like high fashion clothing, you might like the dresses. I was trying to figure out the meaning of the elongated and silent/music only scenes, and got to the conclusion, that they mean absolutely nothing. If you like cinematography, and beautiful colors, and pictures, you can really enjoy some scenes. Great camera work, very detailed sound.

So apart from the fact, that the story would only call for a 5 minute film, they managed to elongate it to 90 minutes. You don't get bored (because of the scenery) but when it ends, you just feel nothing. 

Eye-candy, thats all.

For someone who knows a bit the true story on which it is based, the movie absolutely puts no new perspective on the facts themselves or the members of the Bling Ring. The script consists of an extremely redundant succession of burglaries, punctuated by a few excerpts from interviews which unsubtly try to explain the motivations of those teenagers. The plot lacks substance, there is almost no dramatic tension, and even the atmosphere, one of Coppola's work's most appealing aspect, has here trouble establishing itself and carrying away the viewer. The movie gets boring quite quickly and after an hour, it seems two have passed. In the end, it is not sure that this story deserved a feature.

I only watched this in the hopes of seeing Emma Watson semi-nude, but the movie doesn't even manage that much. It's about a bunch of teenagers whose stupidity defies description stealing from celebrities whose stupidity also defies description. Usually a movie makes you identify with the characters to some degree, even if you don't really like them, but this movie just made me want to take a flamethrower and burn everyone in it to ashes. The only bright spot was seeing the male member of the gang board a bus to prison and imagining what the other inmates would do to him. If you have a shred of intelligence and dignity, you will not enjoy the film.

Similar to another reviewer, I saw an early screening of The Bling Ring back in April. My initial reaction after watching the film was somewhat nondescript  a little disappointed, but overall unsure if I enjoyed it or not. Upon watching and reading interviews with Sofia Coppola, however, I believe that that uncertain feeling is exactly the reaction she intended to imbue in audiences. The Bling Ring does not so much act as a commentary on the characters' fame and money driven actions by clearly defining the characters as young, immature, selfish, amoral, or loathsome. Instead, it allows the audience to form their own opinion by capturing these characters behaving in ways that not even they, especially Israel Broussard's character, always find moral, yet are always rooted in their obsession with fame and luxury.

By planting big names into the film (i.e. Emma Watson, Leslie Mann, and her own), Sofia Coppola is luring in audiences who, to whatever degree, can relate to the characters and their celebrity fascination. Publicity for the movie attempts to appeal to this audience genre by pushing the two biggest names associated with the film to the forefront of its promotions Sofia Coppola and Emma Watson. Most of the film's promotional posters consist of the film's title and Sofia Coppola's writing and directorial credit foregrounding an image with Emma Watson prominently in the middle of the main cast. These techniques allude that Watson, being the biggest star, acts as the ringleader; however this is not the case. On Emma's official Twitter, she even attempts to dissolve this misconception: "I don't really 'star' in the Bling Ring. I am probably 3rd/4th of the lead characters. (In case media/marketing is a bit misleading.) The awesome Israel Broussard and Katie Chang take the helm. #BlingRing." Most of the general audience that will see this movie will probably be disappointed by the lack of Emma Watson screen time and will savor every lip lick, pole dance, and 'valley-girl' delivered line. However, Katie Chang, Israel Broussard, Claire Julien, and Taissa Farmiga hold their own with all the Hollywood veterans and provide a breath of fresh air to all the summer action blockbusters that, while enjoyable, can become predictable, tiresome, and forgettable in a sea of similar films.

Coppola mixes the excitement of drugs, clubs, guns and car crashes with scenes that some might describe as downright slow and boring. However, the fluctuating pace highlights Coppola's unwillingness to make the film into an easily generic story about teens that get caught up on the wild side only to inevitably get caught by authority. Instead, the film captures a sense of realism that reflects the characters own attitudes by depicting the initial excitement, eventual banality, and growing need to 'up the ante' while attempting to emulate the Hollywood "good life". The film's final scene leaves the audience unsure of how to react, but curiously wanting more.

While the film is by no means a blockbuster nor a film that most of my personal friends add to their lists of favorites, I believe that if you allow yourself to step back from the superhero, zombie, and other action-packed movies that are dominating theaters this summer, then The Bling Ring becomes a beautifully crafted and thoroughly enjoyable yet self-reflective piece on the dynamics between the celebrity-status and the audience/fan.
